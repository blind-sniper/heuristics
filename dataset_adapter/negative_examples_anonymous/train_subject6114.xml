<TEXT> So you haven't really given a language you want to do this in but here we go!  
  
Java: Things like buttons can be assigned callbacks pretty easily by adding an ActionListener. It's basically what you have described so I think that would work nicely.  
  
Python: I'm going to assume you have some sort of GUI (I suppose) that for the sake of the answer - is made with the wonderful and ever glamorous TK. Assuming you create a button on your screen through drawing on the canvas - you can use something like this:  

    root.bind('Key',lambda event: keyPressed(canvas,event))  
This will make your clicks register to a function keyPressed. It might look like this:

    def keyPressed(canvas,event):  
        if event.keysym == "Left":  
            if canvas.data.level  0:  
                canvas.data.level -= 1  
                canvas.delete(ALL)  
                canvas.create_rectangle(-5,-5,canvas.data.row+5,canvas.data.col+5, fill='dark green')  
                fractalMickeyMouse(canvas,canvas.data.xc,canvas.data.yc,canvas.data.r,canvas.data.level)  

Alternatively you can use a TK Widget Button and just define callback.  

Hope this helped. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trigger IFTTT Recipes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-26 17:32:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It currently is very difficult to make a recipe that is complex and robust. Sometimes, it is even harder to link recipes with events that you want to happen because it is a three step process where the middle step is disjoint from the final step. 

I wanted to have a recipe that every day at 12:30 PM grabbed the top post from a subreddit and posted it to the GroupMe. Now, I may be wrong - but I did look around and can't really think of a way to do this. However, if there was a way to make IFTTT recipes a trigger, it would really open up the possibilities for this. It would allow for hugely extensible recipes that could do huge amounts of work for you or even just provide some really cool functionality. Just a thought.

If someone knows how to do what I'm asking I would love to know since right now I'm pretty lost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cost of removing an element in a linked list is definitely less than rewriting an entire array. Worst case linked list search is O(n) time, but uses no resources, and fixing pointers is O(1) time with what, 2 writes? 

Meanwhile, copying and writing to a new array is what, 2n - 1 read/write operations? This is way more expensive in terms of resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I'm not sure what is going on here but consider this.

    output_greaterequal-first-next = pointer;
    temp =output_greaterequal-first-next;
    temp-next=NULL;

So imagine this is not the first element being put in your list. It is over the threshold, and there is already something in the list. You set the next element of the list to be the pointer so you could have had this to begin with:

First-A-B-C-NULL 

or something like that.
This means first-next is A. But now, you set first-next to pointer (P). So, now your list looks like this.

First-P

and then temp is also set to P, and then it looks like this.

Temp = P-NULL

and now the value is NULL so we break out but your list was messed up in the process it seems?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not totally sure what you are trying to do but if you are trying to compare digits of numbers you can use % to get specific digits right, since modular arithmetic would get rid of the rest of the number? 

ex. 13 % 10 = 3

To get the 10's digit would be a bit different,

134 for example would be (134 % 100) / 10
134 % 100 is 34, and 34 / 10 is 3.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [C] Proxy Server Sending Replacement Characters </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-27 20:42:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So basically, I'm writing a proxy server in C. It only needs to handle GET requests atm. I can take a GET request like very simple

GET www.amazon.com HTTP/1.0 

and then generate a request header like follows: 

    GET / HTTP/1.0
    Host: www.amazon.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0.3) Gecko/20120305 Firefox/10.0.3
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Connection: close
    Proxy-Connection: close

The proxy then forwards the request to the server in that form and reads the response. I get all the response headers back just fine, but when it comes to reading actual content and forwarding it to the client from the proxy I just get a bunch of replacement characters.

    ^3h)UKfD*yh2' Rb8"u                         =qggEyYj1'sp[MI

I don't really know why this is happening or how to fix it. 

If you need to see how I read from the response file (forward to client) I can post, but I don't think the way it is done has anything to do with why these characters are coming up. </TEXT>
