<TEXT> I legit am telling you the truth with this story:
Once when I had never cooked anything besides microwave popcorn and toast, my gf and I had a craving for mozerella cheese sticks. Instead of going out, we decided to try to make them.  We filled up a pot of oil and put it on the stove to boil.  Then we lifted the lid and it shoots up in flames!  Now we should have just put the lid back on and removed it from the heat, but instead we did this: We called the fire department and ran outside.

Now the fire department can and a fireman went into the kitchen while we watched through the window.  This is what we saw him do: He picked up the flaming pot of oil and brought it over to the sink and turned the faucet on.  It was like this gif.  Fortunately the fireman was wearing a protective suit, but the ceiling was toasted.  Suffice to say, my gf did not get her deposit back  for the apartment.

I was pretty shocked to see this, because I really thought this would be the first thing they teach you NOT to do in firefighter school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You being downvoted shows the ignorance of the average reader here.  Of course it is the CONTENT of the food.  Nutrition is really important for weight loss and overall good health.  Not all calories are equal.  If you eat buttloads of sugar you aren't getting any nutrition and you will still be hungry and will eat more food.  If you eat a well-balanced wholesome meal you will feel satiated for longer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is no way chicken will magically make you lose more weight than a well-planned plant based diet, especially not if you do not exercise.

That's true, and I was never arguing otherwise.  But she is acting on the advice of her doctor, however wrong that advice is. The language of "betrayal" also implies that eating vegan is some kind of team, or worse, a religion where we try to win "converts". We shouldn't be so emotionally invested in our dietary choices that we feel personally attacked when someone decides to try something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, you COULD feel angry and upset, it's understandable.  But is it useful?  Not really.  I think you are taking it personally when it really has nothing to do with you.  Your wife isn't betraying you, she's just responding the circumstances in her life (however misguided her reasoning may be).  Have you talked to her about other strategies for reducing her carb intake WITHOUT reverting to animal consumption?  You and your wife should be on the same team here, and that team's goal is for you both to have good health.  Also, maybe she needs a better doctor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have read much of the Hebrew Bible.  Yes, there are some thing that sound fucked up in there, but most people do not take them literally.  There are many ways to interpret these texts.  Most jews that I know practice peace, charity, and [Tikkun olam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam) (the practice of "reparing the world") .  Judaism is one of the least understood religions, because they don't make any effort to proselytize, and they only bother to explain things to people who ask.  Because of this, people have been misinterpreting the religion for centuries.

[Here are some awesome jews who are wholly against Zionism](http://www.truetorahjews.org/).  Remember, the first Zionists where all secular and didn't make any sort of religious claims.  Some Zionists have tried to use religious arguments to manipulate religious jews into supporting their cause.  They have deliberately conflated Zionism and Judaism. Please don't do the same thing.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Seeking a permaculture internship on the West Coast </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-29 22:50:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My vision is to join or start a self-sufficient community designed around the principals of permaculture, such as diversity, integration, creative response to change, etc.  I practice yoga and meditation almost everyday to aid in my personal transformation.  I'm skilled at organizing people, inspiring others, and conveying a vision.

What I am lacking are some practical skills for operating a self-sufficient community.  Particularly, I'm looking for hands on experience with designing and setting up a sustainable permaculture food garden/farm/forest.  My ideal situation would be to live and work on an operating or developing farm for several months, with some formal lessons to lay a foundation of understanding.  I do not have thousands of dollars to spend and I'm hoping for a work/study arrangement.

Please, if you know of a place like this, ideally in CA, OR, or WA, let me know!  This is not a passing whim, but something I see as integral to my life's/soul's progression.

Also, what actions can I be taking right now to prepare myself for something like this?  Thank you!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yelling doesn't make your argument any stronger. Calm down! You were responding to OP who stated that is a travesty that many young black men are in prison for MINOR drug charges, to which you objected.  I was replying to you in light of OPs statement.

But while we are at it, IMHO, if drugs were dealt with in a sensible manner, dealers wouldn't be severely penalized either unless they were pushing to kids or engaged in violent behaviour.  It's a transaction between consenting adults about what to put in their own bodies.  Why don't we throw all the pharmaceutical pushers in jail?  These are actually the most abused drugs. </TEXT>

1. Realize that only you can make yourself happy.  Stop looking outside of yourself for that perfect person/job/situation to change your life.
2. Meditate. Learn to quiet your mind and get in touch with your truest self.
3. Exercise everyday.  Get addicted to endorphins.  A healthy mind follows a healthy body.
4. Make lists of things you are grateful for.  Use these things to cultivate a feeling of well-being and practice holding this feeling for as long as possible each day.
5. Aim to please yourself, not other people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was taking this from the article:

 If youre a little hazy on the meaning, it means to inhale and exhale the vapor produced by an electronic cigarette device, which are themselves also sometimes known as vapes. The word was coined as a way of distancing the act of e-smoking from the act of smoking combustible tobacco cigarettes, the OED said in a statement today.

But from the [OED's blog](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/press-releases/vape-named-oxford-dictionaries-word-year-2014/):
*vape*, verb
Inhale and exhale the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device

*vape*, noun
 An electronic cigarette or similar device; an act of inhaling and exhaling the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device

At least it does say "or similar device" *cough cough* cannabis vaporizer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To force companies to include certain messages, knowing full well that people have an irrational fear of the thing these messages are informing of is a blatant violation of companies right to commercial free speech.

The purpose of labels is to educate.  Laws shouldn't be made based on assumptions of how people will react to education.  This line of thinking is directly from the industry.  They are afraid of losing business because of people "irrational" fear of GMOs, but whether or not those fears are irrational is irrelevant.  If industry is so proud of their product it is there job to present their side to consumers.  It is consumers' right to do their own research and come to their own conclusions.  Without labels people cannot make informed decisions about what to buy and what industry practices they want to support.  I'm sure there are many people who think GMOs are the best thing since sliced bread and will buy them specifically because they are GM.  This is their right as well.

Now, exactly what constitution statute are you referring to?  You can't possibly be suggesting that it's a 1st amendment violation.  That is really laughable.  Denying people access to information is protecting "free speech"?  Be honest, that argument is spurious at best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Zionists have taught us all why Jews have been hated since the days of the Roman Empire, driven out of one community after another over the centuries

Your first sentence is saying that the actions of the Zionists are indicative of some trait of all jews that have caused them to be pariahs throughout history.  You aren't talking about "Zionists Jews" in this case because there were not Zionists "since the days of the Roman Empire".  You are the one with malicious intent.  You are trying to incite rage against all jews by implying that they have some sort of inherent character or cultural flaw that leads to them being persecuted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WTF is "politically feasible"? All that amounts to is pandering to the status quo.  The way democracy is supposed to work is that when the majority of citizens wants something, that's what they've get.  But when we are so concerned with politics that it inhibits us from even TRYING to get what we really want, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  We have to redefine in our own minds what is possible and stop limiting ourselves according to some arbitrary standard of "practicality". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Woah dude.  You really need to check your attitude.  Where did I sign up to be your online therapist?  I thought I'd send you a few words of encouragement to hopefully make you think and get you on the right path of changing your thought patterns.  You could try being a little grateful that a stranger is willing to do that for you.

It sounds like you need more help than I can offer you via this correspondence.  Have you ever considered seeing a professional?  Having someone to talk to on a consistent basis can really help you to get in touch with your own feelings and thought patterns, and maybe uncover the root of the problems you are having.

I'll leave you with a few final words in the sincere hope that they help you: Ultimately, the only person that can make you happy is yourself.  You cannot control how other people will act, but you can always control your own reactions to what comes (or doesn't come) into your life.  Learning to observe and direct your own emotional state will dramatically effect the course of your life.  Most people want circumstances to change so they can feel better, but in reality, you have to feel better FIRST, by whatever means necessary, even if you have to "trick" yourself at first.  Once you've adjusted your attitude you will notice things will start going your way more and more often, until it becomes a natural flow.  It's the art of living.  I sincerely hope you think about what I'm saying and open yourself up to a new way of being. The universe WANTS you to be happy.  Everything you need to accomplish this is in your hands.  Bless you and good luck, brother. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So your list includes people who left the government to work for Monsanto as evidence of some kind of revolving door. Quite the stretch if you ask me.

That's actually the definition of a "revolving door".

From the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics\)) which I suggest you read:

 Industry, in turn, hires people out of government positions to gain personal access to government officials, seek favorable legislation/regulation and government contracts in exchange for high-paying employment offers, and get inside information on what is going on in government.

Moreover, you seemed to have cherry picked examples from the list that are the least incriminating.  Clarence Thomas, by the way, worked for Monsanto for 3 or 4, but the length of time is irrelevant.  Anytime a judge of a case is a former employee of a plaintiff in a trial, there is a real conflict of interest.  2 former FDA commissioners have also worked for Monsanto as well.  There are simply way too many connections to ignore.  This is clearly a case of the wolves guarding the hen house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Labeling laws are kind of the last resort of people who are concerned about ecological effects.  The federal government is a revolving door with the biotech industry.  Look at [this chart](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) for details.  Because of the governments unwillingness to impose rigorous testing standards, and instead rely on the companies' own research to approve new strains, the only option a concerned citizen has is to avoid supporting the industry with their purchasing power.  Of course, this is very difficult to do if we don't have knowledge of which products contain GMOs, and that's the way they like it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you actually read the link I sent you you would know this already.  Here is just ONE example:

Plants are bred to be resistant to glyphosate herbicides.  Farmers begin spraying massive amounts of glyphosates on their crops due to the resistance.  The targeted weeds evolve resistance to the herbicide.  Monsanto creates stronger herbicide and new crops with resistance to this herbicide.  The cycle repeats.  As the herbicides get stronger and stronger the collateral damage to the ecosystem gets higher.  These herbicides are already known to cause damage to certain insect life. </TEXT>

Most people here seem incapable of nuanced thought, and so are imposing rational minds to a tyrannical atmosphere.  It's time we evolve past this concept of "teams" or "sides" or even spectrum.  We live in a beautiful multidemensional universe with an infinite number of moving parts.  We can't distill things down to "Good" or "Bad". I wish more people on reddit would grow up and evolve their thinking a little bit.  Nuance people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bill THANK YOU for speaking up on this.  Too many people here act like any kind of critical opposition or concern with GMOs is by definition "anti-science".  They have been able to effectively frame the debate about human health and for the most part ignore the environmental implications.  The precautionary principal should stand here, because we could be changing the ecosystem in an irrevocable way.

In your opinion, are scientists who are skeptical over the safety and efficacy of GMOs given a fair chance to research and present this research?  Is there some sort of systematic discrimination going on in the form of funding cuts or ostracization?  

Thank you again for speaking with bravery and integrity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, you do what you can when you can.  I started like 10 years ago just reducing my meat consumption to once a day. Now I eat completely vegan!  There are actually a ton of really awesome dairy alternatives.  For instance: [here's a really yummy vegan mac and cheese recipe](http://veganyumminess.com/creamy-vegan-mac-and-cheese/).

You don't have to go cold turkey or even ever completely give it up if you don't want, but reducing your meat and dairy consumption as you are comfortable is a huge help to animal welfare, and not to mention the environment!  Thanks for asking questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where are you getting your information from?

I googled that exact quote and the only the people using that quote are from sites dedicated to bashing Jews, not from Jews themselves.

Here is the real text of the Talmud online: 
http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/talmud.htm

Now show me where in it, it says anything like that quote.  There isn't even a real conception in Jewish thought of a place called "Hell".  It's a more modern Christian concept, so this quote is highly dubious.

EDIT: and for the record, I've never ONCE heard a Jewish person refer to anyone as a "Goyim", I've ONLY heard it from people claiming that Jews regularly refer to the rest of the world by this word.  Jews really aren't the demons you're making them out to be.  I really suggest you open your heart and maybe try talking to some actual Jews to get their perspective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuck this.  The Israeli government does not represent Jews as a whole.  Their name has been hijacked by Zionists.

Also, There is no legitimate reason to persecute anyone.  Here is the definition of persecute:

subject (someone) to hostility and ill-treatment, especially because of their race or political or religious beliefs.

Even if you can say without a doubt that the majority of members of any particular group are behaving badly, collective punishment is unfair and unhelpful.  It's unfair because of the members of that group that don't participate in this behaviour and may even speak out against it.  It's unhelpful because once you've stigmatized the entire group it causes an "us and them" division for both members of the persecuted group, and everyone else, which breaks down communication and bars finding real solutions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My intention is to become a teacher. What path to take? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been practicing yoga for over 5 years, and while I do go through phases of more and less active times in my practice, I see it as an integral part of my life's path.  I have been toying with the idea for some time to make the commitment to become a yoga teacher to share this joy with others.  Recently, I've made that commitment, declaring that I will do teacher training by my next birthday!

I don't know what form this will take, where it will be, or in what specific school I will study.  A note, I'm not necessarily looking to make a "career" out of this; my primary motivation is to deepen my practice and learn the skills I need to safely and effectively help others. I can see myself doing "by donation" classes in local parks.

A few questions come to mind at this point:

* What steps can I take today to move towards my goal?  I've browsed many websites, but I haven't found the one that looks perfect for me.  Still, I want to move forward
* Is "certification" a very important thing when looking for a teacher or school? As I said, I'm not necessarily looking for a job in the traditional sense.
*  Do I have to spend thousands of dollars on this?  Are there programs where I can volunteer for a reduced rate of teaching?
* What about choosing a "style"?  I want to learn all I can about a variety of yogic paths and not box myself in to a particular school.

Thank you for your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's actually a tricky question and you'll get different answers depending on who you ask.  The first Zionists were secular and made a political argument for the creation of the state of Israel.  It is correct to say that modern Zionists are acting "in the name of Judaism", but not everyone agrees that they have the right to do that.  There are actually religious arguments *against* Zionism, such as [this group](http://www.nkusa.org/) lays out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Powers That Be are extremely well organized and they thrive on chaos of the masses.  The more angry and scared people are, the easier it it to funnel their energy into their agenda.  As truth comes to light, the initial reaction is denial, followed by shock, followed by anger.  We need to take the next step, and come to a place of calm understanding.  From there we can begin to get together to take coordinated action to subvert the agenda.

There need not be one single, agreed upon plan, this is the MO of the power hoarders.  Instead we operate as [autonomous groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_group) that can network when appropriate.  We need to use every means available to us.  If we get active, WE DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THE WORLD *THEY* WANT US TO.   Do not fall into the defeatist trap.  That is part of their plan.  This is our planet and it's time we take it back. </TEXT>

The bill is widely interpreted as a way of preventing sensitive information about Fukushima (among other topics) reaching the Japanese public and by extension the rest of the world  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, I was just describing the methodology that 432 tuning arose out of.  I didn't make it up.  The doubling is because that is how an octave is defined!  The note A is always given as the base pitch for any standardized tuning. You clearly do not know much about music theory in general and I think you are speaking out of ignorance on a lot of topics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure.  It's called the [Schumann resonances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances) which is basically an electromagnetic resonance caused by the interaction of the constant lightning around the Earth and the Earth's atmosphere.  It so happens that the fundamental frequency of this is 7.83 hz approximately 8.  Now, musically an octave is defined by a doubling a frequencies, so using this as the base we arrive at 512 hz for middle C (EDIT: sorry, one octave above middle C).  Basing the other notes around that frequency we get 432 hz for A.  I'm actually not sure why the numbers are rounded.  Maybe because of the appeal of using powers of 2? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a proponent of 432 tuning also known as [scientific pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch).  I don't necessarily think 440 hz tuning is result of a conspiracy, more likely simply a mistake out of ignorance.  I believe that even if you can't distinguish the difference consciously, there are still unconscious effects of listening to frequencies that are actually in sync with the humming of the Earth.  It is subtle, but real.  This is a very new topic and I don't know of any scientific studies examining it, but it's definitely something ripe for exploration.  I'd advice you to not simply write something off immediately because it sounds a little out there. </TEXT>

There are many things you can do starting today, biking, reducing energy consumption, switching to plant based diet, starting a garden.

<TEXT>   And if requesting me to do things is what you want to do, by all means, have at it! But rather, how about instead of impotently requesting others to do things for you, how about you try being the change you want to see in the world.

That's exactly why I did start proposing solutions.  Did you even finish reading my post?

 But I guess there will always be defeatists and people who like to hide like you. Nothing new there.

You're calling me defeatist because I asked you to start thinking about solutions? That's funny. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with your diagnosis of the problem, but when you make a post like this, can you please spend at least as much time proposing solution as you do illustrating the problem?  I realize this is a big departure from the the current culture of this subreddit, but without solutions and proposed actions there is absolutely no point to even illustrating the problem.  In fact, psychologically, we were better off before we knew, or when we weren't thinking about it.

I'll start: How can we stop war?  We can make war-mongering politically unfeasible by recalling/no longer electing anyone who supports war.  We can stop paying the portion of our taxes that goes to fund wars.  We can protest.  We can engage in anti-recruitment to ensure there aren't enough soldiers to engage in war. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said that.  It sometimes is. I also don't think it's universally a negative force in the world.  At it's worst it is brainwashing and violence-inducing.  At it's best, it brings people together with a knowledge that they can work together to improve the world.

Look, I'm not really a fan of organized religion.  I prefer a more fluid and personal path to spirituality.  I just don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first statement, I absolutely agree with.  Religion does not have a monopoly on morality.

#2, depends on how you parse it.  For instance, would something like the Spanish Inquisition happen without religion? Not exactly like that, no.  But people can still be zealots without being religious.  Political zealots can engage is mass murder and persecution as well, like stalinists or anti-communists for example.

It's really not possible to distill all the world's problems down to a single thing.  Or if it is, it's something more fundamental than religion, maybe like ego, or fear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If people don't have religious beliefs, you're right, it's impossible to manipulate them on the basis of THOSE beliefs.  But my point is that religious beliefs are not the only way that capitalists manipulate people (particularly into war.)  They also use economic imperatives, non-religious ideology, and and just plain scaremongering.  I'll give you an example of each.

Economic imperative: "We need to go in and open up those trade routes!" or "Fight this war and you get money for college."

Non-religious ideology: "We've got to stop those commies or they'll destroy freedom everywhere!"

<TEXT> I managed to fix my problem.  I had to recreate my Live USB and then I reinstalled.  I did two things wrong on my first attempt to install.  I didn't make a separate /home partition (I'm not sure if this is actually necessary but folks on the irc channel said I should.)  I think the main problem was that I selected sda1 as the boot disc instead of just sda.  After I reinstalled it booted directly into Mint.  After running "sudo os-prober" and "sudo update-grub" it now gives me GRUB on boot with both Mint and Windows present. Hurray! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help fixing GRUB after un/reinstalling Linux Mint on dual boot system </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-29 00:55:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is long, but I'm trying to give all the necessarily details to get help.  Currently I can't boot either Windows or Linux.

I had a system with Windows 8 on one partition and Linux Mint on another and GRUB booting.  At some point Linux Mint became corrupt and I decided to wipe the partition and reinstall it. I chose to install Linux Mint KDE 64 bit edition.

So I created a Live USB and boot from that and did a manual disk partition.  I deleted the partition with Linux and created two new partitions in that space.  The first 3GB as a swap partition.  The remaining space became the a partition of type ext4 and mount point "/".  I think it's device id was /dev/sda5.  I selected sda1 to be the boot partition because I think this is where GRUB was location previously (it had a size of 500MB). sda2 is the Windows partition.  The installation went ahead and now when I boot I get this:

 Grub Loading. Welcome to Grub!
error: no such partition.
Entering rescue mode...
grub rescue

My first thought was to try to repair GRUB from linux so I put the bootable usb back and.  But now when i try to boot from the usb it gives this:

 MDM could not write a new authorization entry to disk. Possibly out of diskspace.   Error: no space left no device.

I press OK and it says:

 Could not start the X server (your graphical environment) due to some internal error...

It then goes to a black screen.  Next I will try making another bootable USB on my other computer since it apparently got messed up somehow.

I also tried messing around in the grub rescue prompt but I don't really know what I'm doing there.  How should I proceed? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.
So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's interesting.  I didn't consider the object bumping into air molecules in front of it and that it would bump into less with the wind blowing in the same direction.

Is there a formula for how much force is applied to the object by the wind based on the object's current velocity, mass, and the wind speed? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, I'm glad you experience the magic of the universe. 

 How would my world be any more magical if I believed a talking bush told me to commit war crimes?

This is a total strawman.

 But I think what really sets us apart is the red pill/blue pill question: could it be that you prefer to hold wrong beliefs that are comforting rather than true beliefs that are not.

What really sets us apart is that you believe in an objective reality and I believe it is more subjective.  That ultimately comes down to a philosophical debate, because it is impossible to prove the nature of the universe to be either way.  But take a look at special relativity for an example of how reality might be different for different observers. </TEXT>

On this subreddit, yes. Not in the world.

  they are only human afterall

at least you concede that!

  but what with seemingly 9/10 jews claiming to be irreligious or atheist

Are you saying that being religious is necessary for being ethical? Because there are quite a lot of contrary examples of that as well.

Yes, it is complicated.  "Jews" means a lot of different things to different people.  Basically my point is, you can't pigeonhole people. If you go around assuming things about people and treating them based off of your ASSUMPTIONS about them, it's not only incredibly hurtful to people who don't deserve your scorn, but you are also missing out on some potential allies.

So you don't like racism right?  I'll leave you with the word's the late great MJ:

<TEXT> I certainly don't have a geocentric view of the world.  Rather, the center is everywhere.  Also, the shift in my view wasn't based solely on scientific discovery, though it certainly played a part.  I think most importantly was the profound feelings of connection I felt that I couldn't easily rationalize away (and really I no longer have any desire to rationalize these things away).  I guess I really don't understand why some people try so hard to remove all sense of magic from the world.  Is that really the world you want to live in? </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the end of the day, there are many things that we don't KNOW.  So where do go from there?  We kind of fill in the blanks.  You can be agnostic about these things, and that's honorable, but sometimes entertaining a belief that you are not 100% sure of is not only harmless, but useful.  For instance, you might not be sure that you can run a marathon.  But you harbor this belief in yourself that you can, and this causes you to push yourself and train, and then lo and behold! you ran a marathon!  I think many things work this way.  Our thoughts actually create our reality.  I don't believe in objective truth and the process of belief to me is very much a creative one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It absolutely led me to believe that my view of the world was too simplistic.  Part of that was realizing that a simple rejection of any notion of spirituality or connection to something larger than myself was too simplistic.  I accept that there is a whole lot that we don't know.  We will continue to learn more and more about the universe and our place in it.  I don't know if we will ever have a definitive answer to these really big questions, and for the moment I have to rely on what I *intuit* and what feels the best.  It seems to me like a lot of atheist are really uncomfortable with the idea of CHOOSING to believe something, but I think if they took a good look at their own thought process, they would realize they are doing the exact same thing. </TEXT>

I've got to stop you right there.  I was nodding my head through your entire post enthusiastically until I read this line.  You need to understand that you are the creator of your own destiny.  The cliche "whether you believe you can or can't, you're right" stands here.  Study and become a dietician if this makes you happy, it's a great thing to do, but never subjugate your dreams for something more "realistic".

<TEXT>  I am an ex-atheist. I know what atheism is, I was very proud to ascribe this label to myself between the ages of 13 til about 18. I didn't call myself agnostic, I was sure. I took a completely mechanical, deterministic view of the universe. Everything was simply an unfolding of chemical reactions since the Big Bang and in that universe, there is no room for free will, let alone "God".

So what changed? Well, for one, I found out that this is not actually the universe we live in. The world we live in far far stranger than that. There are not 4, but 10? or maybe an infinite number of dimensions. Time is not linear, but more illusory. Zooming down into the most base levels of existence, we find not mechanical reactions, but "vibrations". There is a universality of a force that composes all things. The world of the physical and mental are one.

Today, if I had to label my believe it would fall somewhere between pantheism an panentheism. The psychedelic experiences I've had, as well as dreams, have given me first hand experience that we are tapped into something much larger than ourselves. I don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity. I do believe that what we normally experience is only a tiny fraction of Existence. To be alive and conscious is to be Divine. We are co creators and experiencers of our own magnificence.

Is anyone else here an "ex-atheist"?  To me it seems like a natural progression to go from believing in the God in the Bible, to disbelief, to pantheism. </TEXT>

[Procesing](http://processing.org/) a programming language for creating art!  Allow my to plug [my own](http://www.openprocessing.org/user/6463) portfolio for some examples.

And this book [The Artist's Way](http://www.amazon.com/The-Artists-Way-Julia-Cameron/dp/1585421464) which is a workbook for tapping into your own creativity and to stop censoring yourself!

Your photography is your art!  Whatever medium comes natural to you, practice it everyday and hone it into a talent uniquely yours. </TEXT>

It sure seems like you are making that claim when you post a link to something that is clearly NOT about jews but about Israel and call it anti-semetic.

Like I said before, there are a few people on that sub who routinely turn criticism of Israel into anti-semtism. And I and others call them out on their racist bullshit.  But you are poisoning the well by pointing to the worst of the bunch and saying it is indicative of the majority.

 you know, like you're doing right now.

I'm not defending "thinly veiled antisemitism".  I'm defending the right of people to criticize Israel without being called racist (when they are actually not being racist).  It might seem like a tough distinction to make but it's really important to make that distinction. </TEXT>

BUT that does not mean that everyone on that sub who is critical of Israel is anti-semitic.  What if I told you that there are jews who are critical of Israel? Does that blow your mind?  I know you probably don't care about this because your agenda is just to make people on that sub look bad, but I think you are being disingenuous when you conflate anti-zionism with anti-semitism.

<TEXT>  A quote from a speech he gave in 1938:

 I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustainespecially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.

<TEXT> How the heck do you figure that the ability to destroy one's own ecosystem is "superiority"?  As for "self-awareness" that is nearly impossible to define.

Try this on for size: superiority is a completely relative concept with no absolute definition.  It's just you saying "This is better than that" which translates to "I like this better than that."  Evolution does not give a shit about what you like better.  Complex does not equal better than simple.  The only metric of success you can use when talking about a lifeform is its ability to survive and proliferate, and by that metric, insects are surely doing better than we. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And how much is it to fly a head of lettuce across the continent, or a crate of bananas across the ocean?

Transporting anything is associated with carbon emissions, yes.  But that's not the point and that isn't what causes the huge emissions of meat consumption.  It is combination of methane output of cows and deforestation to make grazing land.

  and what of the carbon cost of the fertilizer that their manure replaces? 

[Manure only makes about 5% of fertilizer.](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.com/2013/03/no-cows-dont-make-fertilizer.html)  This is a non issue.

 My point is that you cannot just take one part of modern society and blame it for all of the ills of modern society. 

No one is claiming that meat consumption is to blame for ALL the ills of modern society.  Rather, it's about 14 and 22 percent of a very challenging problem. (Not to even mention the other compelling arguments for eating a plant-based diet.) If we want to solve it, we need to break it down and figure out what we can change.  Eating less meat is part of that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit: let me rephrase that.

You are right, air travel is an absolutely huge contributor to one's carbon footprint.

But Morrissey is right too.

[According to Scientific America](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-greenhouse-hamburger/):
The FAO report found that current production levels of meat contribute between 14 and 22 percent of the 36 billion tons of "CO2-equivalent" greenhouse gases the world produces every year. It turns out that producing half a pound of hamburger for someone's lunch a patty of meat the size of two decks of cards releases as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as driving a 3,000-pound car nearly 10 miles.

It's a fairly easy change to make with a huge impact, which is probably why he's touting it, but does it make up for the rest of the carbon emissions involved in his lifestyle? Probably not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm travelling South America and I'm boarding a bus in Ecuador.  I have a plastic water bottle full of processed San Pedro cactus (which is a lot like Peyote, contains mescaline).  I also have some weed, which can also get you serious jail time in Ecuador.  As I'm waiting in line to board the bus, I notice a uniformed guard (perhaps a police officer?) searching people's bags before boarding.  I split off from my friend and walk around the corner where I down the San Pedro, not wanting it to go to waste, and put the weed in my sock under my foot....

Back at the bus, the guard is doing a really thorough job searching and it is taking quite a while.  By the time it is my turn I'm starting to feel the effects of the San Pedro kick in.  The guard asks me immediately to completely empty my bag.  I have a guitar, which he shakes, juggling balls, which he sniffs, and a little pipe which I've used to burn the herb that morning.  He examines the pipe for a long time, sniffing it, scraping tar with his finger, while my heart is pounding.  I mutter "para tobacco" as if that doesn't make me any more suspicious.  Finally he asks me to remove my shoes and it's all I can do to keep it together.  I step out of my my shoes and I'm now standing on top of the marijuana.  He shines a flashlight in my shoes and then finally, after what seemed like a half an hour search, tells me to get on the bus.

Needless to say, it was an interesting bus trip after that. </TEXT>

Some ~~psychoanalysis~~ *psychological interpretations* of these dreams:

Little man mowing your facial hair symbolizes man's struggle to tame nature. Just as we trim back the wilderness, the modern man must also strive to tame his own inner beast through the rituals of grooming.


Child's head literally inside the man. The inner child longs to break through and say hello.


Tiny little people escape with your heart. In a world were everything is up for grabs, and we fear the loss of economic stability, our greatest fear is to lose our heart, our humanity.


The invisible bicycle fulfills the wish for mobility and stealth.


Changing the batteries on your hands is a psychological indication that we are moving towards the singularity. Technology is becoming more and more an extension of one's own self. We are witnessing the blurring of the lines of the body and machine.


The camera head man takes photos through a human head. When we constantly see the world from behind a camera lens, it becomes difficult to distinguish which is the tool and which is the operator.
The changing of a head like a light bulb is a similar theme to above.


Bathing in a hot cup of coffee like a nice refreshing swim to wake you up in the morning. We soak and bask in the buzzing of the caffeine-ridden brain, a modern comfort and way of life.


Lugging around your own giant head perfectly exemplifies the conundrum of our left-brain dominated society. We fear we exist too much in the head, and it weighs down our heart. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well.. when I think back about all the time I've spend watching this series, my fondest memories are from the very beginning.  The first episode filled me with awe and wonder at the huge magical world engrossing me. The scope and scale of it were staggering.  Every character was immediately intriguing. I had a friend (a book reader) who would stop every few minutes and explain in a little more detail what was going on.  I was so curious and had so many questions!  I still remember my heart pounding when I saw Bran fall.

I've introduced so many people to this show and I always love rewatching the first few eps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello!  I'm looking for some help troubleshooting starting my engine.  First of all, I can rule out the battery, the glow plugs, and the starter.  All are new and just replaced.  I also just attempted to replace the fuel filter because I had a suspicion that the fuel is not flowing properly.  When I got to the step about bleeding air from the fuel by opening the air valve and cranking the engine, nothing came out of the hose.  Any help would be appreciated.  I can take pics and report back as needed. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want 13 episodes and here's why:
They are already plowing through the books (with book 5 plotlines of Daenerys and Theon).  More episodes means more time for them to fill and more invented stuff.  Generally the plotlines that HBO writes are really weak compared to what is in the books.  So more episodes would probably mean more of that stuff.  I don't think they will start including more characters from the books because they are concerned that the show is already too complicated for most people to keep track. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not being a D is and this is not just a semantical argument.  If one is interested in driving a "zero emission" vehicle it's probably because they care about their carbon footprint and they have real concerns about their environmental impact.  How the electricity is actually generated is of paramount importance.  The point in the production and distribution of the energy where the fossil fuels are burned (where the emissions happen) is actually the irrelevant thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is good, but this article refers to these vehicles as "zero emissions" which is a bit misleading.  Just because there's no tail pipe doesn't mean that nothing is being burned in the process of powering your vehicle.  Considering that [66.5%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._2013_Electricity_Generation_By_Type_crop.png) of energy in the US comes from burning fossil fuels, that is what will be powering your car.  Unless of course you're plugged into a solar array, then you're truly driving zero emissions. </TEXT>

HBO announced Fortune as playing "Night's Watch Officer", but according to the actor and other sources this is the same role as Bowen Marsh in the books.

In the fourth season Fortune took over the role of Othell Yarwyck, which had been played by Dennis McKeever in the previous seasons. The reason for this sudden change has not yet been explained; or if the characters themselves have been merged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, I had to cut off the connector on my old alt because it was melted into it and solder on a new one.  I have 3 issues left to finish this up!

1. I managed to get my shiny new alternator in, except for this piece (the 3rd image down).  It goes underneath the alt with the long bolt going through it and screws on to the back, I guess to give it more support.  This is probably a dumb question, but how important is this?  It was really hard to get it to go on properly.

2.  I think the belt is a little too loose because that gear below it does not spin when the belt is moving.  It seems almost impossible to get the belt tighter by swiveling the alternator.  Tips?

3. I also replaced the battery and when I went to connect it again there is this 3rd wire (that I'm holding in the picture).  I know this was connected to the negative terminal but I'm really not sure how.  Can I put it in with the other stranded wires? Oh yes, and it starts up fine without it connected, but I'm sure it should be.

OK, thanks for helping everyone.  Really looking forward to having this finished successfully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK.. So, in a previous post you guys helped me get the shroud off to get to the alternator. Awesome.

Now I'm struggling to get the alternator itself out.  I know I need to take that belt off, and I know I need to remove at least one electrical connector.  I completely removed the bolt that seemed like it would allow it to swivel, but it still won't budge.  The second bolt I can see is actually blocked by the belt itself.

Should I just try to stretch the belt enough to get a wrench to that second bolt?  Will it then swivel so I can loosen and remove the belt?

How about the electrical connector?  I'm not sure how to remove it and I don't want to damage it.

Thanks everyone!

Cigarette butts are the most common form of plastic litter on the beaches of the U.S. and world-wide. Toxic chemicals can leach out of the cigarette filters.


Cigarette filters may look like cotton, but are made of cellulose acetate, a plastic that is slow to degrade in the environment. Cigarette filters are specifically designed to accumulate particulate smoke components including toxic chemicals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your post is so arrogant and assumptive it's not really even worth replying to, but here goes.

But the GMO labeling initiative is not in any way meant to inform or educate consumers. It's meant to mislead and scaremonger.

This is not a fact, it's an assumption.  The people who rally and petition to get GMO labeling laws on the ballots care very much about consumer knowledge.  Calling GMOs "GMOs" is not in any way misleading.  If the industry is proud of their product why are they afraid to let people know what it is?  You would think they would wear the label with pride.

Mandatory labeling doesn't necessarily imply a "huge health risk".  It implies that people should be free to make their own decisions for a variety of different reasons.  It has nothing to do with how safe the industry-funded studies say it is.  As I said before, there are a variety of reasons someone might want to avoid GMOs.  We don't need to go point by point on those reasons.  It's about having the knowledge necessary to make personal decisions about what to put in ones own body AND what industry practices we want to encourage with our dollars.  **Saying that people shouldn't have the right to know what they are eating because they don't know what's good for themselves is EXTREMELY arrogant.**

Then you quoted some arguments for labeling in the bill, but offered no refutation of those points, just said it was "propaganda".  Ok, well that's like your opinion, man.

How is slapping a sticker on something that says "GMO" going to solve the problem of GMO ignorance?

Well, for one it's going to let people know that they are and have been eating GMO foods for years.  Make of that what you will.  Most people don't even know what GMOs are.  When they see it labeled they are going to go home and look it up, and then it will be up to them to decide if it's something they want to buy or not.  If you are a proponent of GMOs, the best thing you can do is to make your case for them honestly and out in the open.  Not just hope that people never realize what they are eating.

You obviously didn't read the article I linked to, so whatever.

Now, looking through your post history reveals that your entire account is devoted to pro GMO posting. 2,831 comments and every single one about GMOs.  Now tell us something honestly.  Are you paid to do this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The potential problem with labeling GMOs is that the vast majority of consumers are not educated on them.

You are contradicting yourself with this statement.  You are saying that because most people don't know about GMOs, we shouldn't notify people about GMOs.  Don't you think that if people realized that nearly everything they buy in the store contains GMOs they will be more likely to educate themselves about them?  How is not labeling going to solve the problem of GMO ignorance? It's not.

Moreover, health concerns aren't the only reason people are concerned about GMOs. What about the fact that [pesticide use is increasing due to GMOs](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/02/us-usa-study-pesticides-idUSBRE89100X20121002)?  What about the concerns that GMOs further encourage monoculture farming, something which many believe we need to move away from for the sake of the environment?

Those with concerns about GMOs and their impact on our planet might be more educated than you think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /r/conspiracy is really struggling to walk this fine line.  The problem arises from Zionism being so conflated with Judaism, by Zionist themselves, as well as its critics.  We all know that criticism of Israel doesn't equate to "antisemitism" (anti-Judaism).  It becomes confusing because of the Zionist's insistence that it does, which is really presumptuous on their part because there are MANY jews who either actively oppose Zionism, or just don't care that much one way or the other.  Further, many people do in fact use the "anti-Zionism does not equal antisemitism" defense to say things which actually ARE anti-jewish.  I see it on this subreddit all the time and it becomes really exhausting to call it out all the time (while usually being downvoted for doing so). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You correctly identified the challenges, but why ever start with the premise that a problem "won't be solved"? These certainly are big challenges and it does look like the cards are stacked against us, but we can and WILL overcome. I will never believe that humanity is doomed to slavery.  We just need to start thinking outside the box and taking bold action.

Companies are legally responsible for maximizing profit to shareholders, not sharing the profits with workers or hiring more workers

This is true of corporations, and this is why we should avoid working for corporations.  Join or start a workers coop!  I've seen some very successful ones, for instance, look at the rise of credit unions as an alternative to commercial banks.  What's to stop worker's collectives from advancing in every single industry if we have the will to do it?

Globalization has merely made all human labor cheaper as jobs now compete with slave labor (it's unbelievable wrong that slavery still exists in the year 2014... yet slaves make our clothes, our ipads, etc.)

So stop buying crap.  Commit to buying/trading/gifting locally with people you know.  You'll end up with really unique stuff that you treasure and that you know that no one suffered to make.

Technology continues to reduce the need of human labor

This is actually a really good thing!  It's only under our current system that technology (which is really just efficiency) becomes a hardship for people.  Doing things with less effort is a good thing.  I can image a world where machine produce our food and other goods in sustainable ways and leaves humans to innovate and relax.  Learn DIY technology and you'll be taking the power back.

The rise of the sociopath... the system of profits over social good/contribution rules the day now.

It starts with you.  Change your own life and you begin transforming society.  Transform society and you begin to change people's psychology.

Debt ... finally the big one. When you spend more than you have for a long time, you eventually destroy growth. A person would have declared bankruptcy and started fresh, but a gov with $17T of debt can't declare bankruptcy. With no room for more debt (beyond the rate at which it will rise already) there's basically no money to drive any kind of growth initiatives or more importantly create confidence that things are going to be 'ok' for the next 30 years (which spurs investment).

When people rely less on the pervasive system to meet their everyday needs, money will slowly lose its importance.  This may take a really long time or it may happen very quickly.  In the meantime a political movement to alleviate people from debt would be a big help.

**TL;DR: There is hope.  Think creatively!** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough.  See my reply to /u/NegativeGhostwriter below.  Thanks for replying with actual evidence instead of just ignoring/downvoting me.  I would really like to continue to investigate things with a skeptic such as yourself, and perhaps we can take a look at some other claims.  In the future I'll do my own debunking before submitting bodies of evidence to others (especially skeptics).

Everybody has confirmation bias.  The only way to approach truth is through a constant challenging of beliefs by others who with different world views.  I think a subreddit devoted to theorists and skeptics doing just this in a friendly matter would be awesome.  I (and many other people who challenge widely-accepted assumptions) really am committed to finding the truth, wherever that may lead.  Let's work together on that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take your life into your own hands.  Yes, the system is completely corrupt. You can not rely on your politicians, your "leaders", your government, or your corporations.  You can only rely on yourself and your community.  (Choose your community wisely.)

The way to freedom is through self-sufficiency.  Learn to grow your own food.  If you can produce your own power, even better.  Find the right people to band together with and build a life that depends less and less on the existing power structure.

When people do this in mass, and the state is fading to irrelevancy, it will have one last death throe where it tries with all it's might to cling to power.  But once the illusion of power is broken, there will really be nothing for them to do but die.  Then we will be free.  It all starts with taking matters into our own hands.  It starts with you! </TEXT>

The only explanation I can think of is that the FBI doesn't have this capability itself.

<TEXT> Very interesting part is at the end of the article:

Nassim Taleb, professor of risk engineering at New York University and author of best-sellers 'The Black Swan' and 'Fooled by Randomness,' recently said that GMOs have a very real ability to cause "an irreversible termination of life at some scale, which could be the planet." Talebs thesis basically stems from the fact that GMOs come from laboratory alterations rather than natural processes, and that humans cannot understand that with each modified seed, the potential for total ecocide increases.

"There is no comparison between the [bottom-up] tinkering of selective breeding and the top-down engineering of taking a gene from an organism and putting it into another, Taleb and colleagues say in a draft of their research.

"The planet took about close to zero risks of ecocide in trillions of variations over 3 billion years, otherwise we would not have been here." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It is the Governments of the world allowing things like patenting genes, letting those patents and copyrights exist for a significant amount of time, and making it illegal for farmers to re-use the seed, even if they don't care whether or not the engineered genes survived. If gene patents died out after say, 5 to 10 years, there wouldn't be as much of an issue.

Hmm.. well what happens when you have the same people working for the big corporations that work for the government and go back and forth between them?

<TEXT> There are numerous well-documented studies which provide evidence of fluorides harmful effects on the human body and brain.

You can find a complete compilation of these studies at:
http://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-dangers/health/index.aspx

Ill give a summary of the most important findings:

**Brain Damage**

it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.
SOURCE: National Research Council. (2006). Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA's Standards. National Academies Press, Washington D.C. p 187.

Studies in animals and human populations suggest that fluoride exposure, at levels that are experienced by a significant proportion of the population whose drinking water is fluoridated, may have adverse impacts on the developing brain. Though no final conclusions may be reached from available data, the findings are provocative and of significant public health concern.

SOURCE: Schettler T, et al. (2000). Known and suspected developmental neurotoxicants. pp. 90-92. In: In Harms Way - Toxic Threats to Child Development. Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility: Cambridge, MA. (See report)

As of now, there are 18 human studies indicating that fluoride exposure is associated with lower IQs in children.  This is after controlling for other facturs which are associated with differences in IQ such as lead exposure and family income.  Some excepts:

These negative correlations between IQ and urinary As and between IQ and urinary fluoride indicate that exposure to high levels of As or fluoride, or both, could affect childrens intelligence... This study indicates that exposure to fluoride in drinking water is associated with neurotoxic effects in children.
SOURCE: Wang SX, et al. (2007). Arsenic and fluoride exposure in drinking water: children's IQ and growth in Shanyin county, Shanxi province, China. Environmental Health Perspectives 115(4):643-7.

Conclusion: High fluoride burden has a definite effect on the intellectual and physical development of children.
SOURCE: Wang S, et al. (2005). Effects of coal burning related endemic fluorosis on body development and intelligence levels of children. Journal of Applied Clinical Pediatrics 20(9): 897-898.

**Cancer**

There are many in-vitro laboratory studies which show that fluroide is a mutagenic compound, meaning it causes changes in DNA.  Many mutagenics are also carcinogenic.  One study even found that primates are more sensitive to the mutagenic effects than rats.
See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7679201?dopt=Abstract

Other findings:

As cells were exposed to higher doses of fluoride, the percentage of L-02 cells with DNA damage increased. This result is consistent with other studies... Therefore, considereing previous studies, we think that fluoride can cause lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis, and that there is a positive relationship among these changes.
SOURCE: Wang AG, et al. (2004). Effects of fluoride on lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis in human embryo hepatocytes. Biomedical and Environmental Sciences 17: 217-22.

**Bone Fractures and Bone Disease**

There is a well-known arthritic bone disease known as Skeletal fluorosis caused by excessive fluoride intake. Images: warning! may disturb you  

Many studies show that fluoride weakens bones:

In A/J strain, we found significant decreases in stiffness with increasing fluoride dose treatment. There was a significant difference between the treatment group 0 ppm and 100 ppm... In the A/J strain, there was a decrease in ultimate load with increasing fluoride dose treatment, with significant differences between the treatment group 0 ppm and the treatment group 100 ppm (p=0.017).

SOURCE: Mousny M, et al. (2006). The genetic influence on bone susceptibility to fluoride. Bone Aug 18; [Epub ahead of print]

The highest fluoride intake (50 mg/L) significantly diminished vertebral strength... This impairment of mineralization by fluoride appeared to be the primary cause of the diminished vertebral strength.

SOURCE: Turner CH, et al. (2001). Combined effects of diets with reduced calcium and phosphate and increased fluoride intake on vertebral bone strength and histology in rats. Calcified Tissue International 69: 51-57.

These are just some of the documented health-impairments associated with ingesting fluoride.  Others include:
**Dental Fluorosis** (yellowingof the teeth due to too much fluoride).  I have this!  as does 32% of American children according to the Center for Disease Control
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5403a1.htm

**Pineal and Thyroid gland impairment**  These glands are extremely important in regulating all types of normal body operations like emitting hormones and important neurotransmitters.  According to this study, the pineal gland is the primary target of fluoride accumulation within the body.

<TEXT> Well, you see, complexity is subjective, that's the nature of emergence. What's complex for a child like you is often trivial or routine for a scientist like me. Reddit's userbase is quite diverse, although there seems to be evidence of an over-representation of individuals exhibiting childish behaviors.
Secondly, do you really think this situation has been has been oversimplified? It's through using "copypastas" and other hasty generalizations you try to cram each individual scenario with its particularities into a formulaic mold. I hypothesize you require this simplification because of the state of your mental faculties and reasoning skills.
And lastly, most of the time your simplifications do not aid in understanding new facets of the subject matter. Characterizations that might not be 100% accurate can act as useful models for understanding overarching facets of complex inter-dependent systems, but your "copypastas" do not facilitate in that endeavor.
If even one of these criticisms is valid, your point is moot as it depends unilaterally on all the three premises I've highlighted. The social commentary you wish "copypastas" to exhibit might seem sensible, maybe even profound to you, but they're just as bad, if not worse than the additions reactiongifs, pun chains or novelty accounts bring to the table. Please consider this seriously, and don't immediately fall back on your preconceived notions without reexamining their validity, at least in a cursory manner after I've presented you with this new evidence you really should take seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The solution to all of this is to reorganize society from the ground up. Hyper-local, and online communities with their own internal organization, which can in turn organize into meta-communities like cells of a body.  Community gardens, new forms of communes that embrace the good side of technology.  Any way that we can help each other become self-sufficient.  The more we do this the less we will rely on the status-quo system.  We will cease paying taxes.  No one will elect to go to war.

This is the way out. </TEXT>

Ultimately, everyone will come away from the discussion more informed, and hopefully one step closer to Truth.*

*I will actively combat my own confirmation bias by deliberately seeking viewpoints different than my own.  I will critically evaluate all evidence presented, whether it confirms or challenges my current beliefs.  For I understand that there are no "sides".  Only what is true and what is untrue.*

*I will humble myself enough to admit when I am wrong.  There is no shame in changing my mind in light of new information.  My goal is not only to guide others towards realization, but also myself.*

*The process of investigating with dedication and integrity will serve to make all of us ever-more informed, ever-more discerning, and always moving towards the Truth.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hear ya!  I know that the last thing that someone who is having a hard time wants her hear is that it's their "fault" or anything like that.  I certainly don't want to imply that anyone deserves to be in pain and don't think problems just go away by snapping your fingers.  However, I do believe that changing your attitude towards believing in yourself and focusing on the positive aspects of your life is often prerequisite for fixing those problems.  You can be totally and completely right about how much crap has come your way, but if that's all you think and talk about, it really isn't going to get any better.  We've got to keep focused on that glimmer of hope, the 5% that is working, until it gets bigger and bigger.

It's interesting you mention science, because I feel like the completely materialistic (meaning concerning the material world) and "objective" world view we've adopted is actually an obstacle for many people to come out of the view that the world sucks.  Things are rarely so cut and dry as a laboratory and subjective experience is much more pertinent to our lives.  I know this is a whole philosophical can of worms.  Also, I disagree that worrying really ever serves a useful purpose.  We can certainly address things that come up without getting bogged down in worst-case scenarios.  Like John Lennon said "There are no problems, only solutions!"

You're totally right about that last point! The best thing you can do is to just be happy and help others be happy too! =)

EDIT: Oh, and for the record. I used to be extremely depressed for many years.  Nothing changed about my life except my philosophy and my attitude.  I'm speaking from my personal experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the trouble with this question.  Most of the big lies are so ingrained in people's minds, in fact the way we think, that is nearly impossible to distinguish them as lies.

The one that comes to my mind is the idea that life sucks or is really hard.  I hear this all the time from people who feel like they've had it rough.  It's almost always a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Yes we have problems here on Earth, but the attitude with which we approach these problems makes all the difference.  Unlearn the lie that life is hard, and you'll find it's actually really easy and fun! </TEXT>

There is no possible way systematically defaming political dissidents threw libel, fraud, and "false flag" attacks can be legally justified.  Somehow this should end up in the Supreme Court.  Of course we shouldn't rely on that corrupt bunch to stop this, but a legal fight would certainly bring it to the public's attention.  Right now they are just doing this in the shadows.  We need to force them to defend what they are doing so it can be met with the scrutiny it deserves.

<TEXT> From comments on the article:

There are 75 community gardens on about 23 acres of land scattered throughout the city of Seattle, serving roughly 4500 gardeners. These plots, called p-patches, are open to the public and neither fenced nor guarded. Homeless people often camp next to our patch, and they've never taken anything from the garden to my knowledge (though it's so abundant that a bit of pilferage would be hard to detect). In general, theft from Seattle gardens is very rare, so I would expect the same to be true of the Beacon Food Forest. I'm sure the city will post signs clearly stating that taking more than a single family can consume or selling produce is forbidden. You'd be very surprised how law-abiding people are here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually had this experience while on Ayahuasca.  It was very scary indeed and I was thinking "what a dumb way to die! forgetting how to inhale."  Of course I started breathing again.  The shaman also assured me that my body would not do that to me and I would inevitably find my breath again.  I guess the best thing to do is to remember this, you will start breathing again. Remain calm.  This is part of the wisdom of the experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your reply.  I don't think you're an asshole, just coming from a different perspective.

Ok cool, but that's still 100% anecdotal and completely unscientific. It means absolutely nothing to anyone other than you or your friend.

I understand you are coming at this completely from a scientific POV here, but I really don't think science is the only way to ascertain truth.  There is such a thing as intuition, and just plain observation and reasoning (which science does apply, but most of the time we do this without doing complete scientific studies).  I don't know if there are any studies comparing the prevalence of bad trips on shrooms vs. lsd, but I'd be very curious to see the results.  I do take issue with discounting personal experience completely.  I trust my own experience much more than anecdotes OR studies (which are sometimes falsified or inherently flawed).  Sometimes personal conclusions are wrong too, but at least I know I can trust myself.  This is a huge philosophical topic right here, which I'm sure we can could back and forth on all day, but honestly, do you not believe anything you learned through experience unless there are numerous, repeated, well-constructed studies about it?

but your wording implies that Psilocybin is somehow a more "true" psychedelic than others, and that the differences between psilocybin and chemicals with a similar structure or effect are inherent shortcomings in relation to psilocybin

I do think there is something to be said about the fact that mushrooms have been around on Earth for as long as we have.  [Terrance McKenna had some interesting thoughts on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZbxRzWYLc)

This is only very loosely even close to the truth. First of all, there's not just one "lock" and there's no "distorted" way for the "key" to fit.

I was speaking metaphorically.  I have a general understanding of neurotransmitters and how psychoactive drugs work.

 it just strikes me as somewhat intellectually dishonest to make a post implying that shrooms are somehow better or healthier than LSD, or that there's any relative reason to avoid LSD in the first place.

I don't have an agenda and I'm not trying to mislead people.  I encourage everyone to do their own research and trust their own experiences!  I also don't think there is anything wrong with sharing one's own experience and the thoughts that have come out of those experiences.

<TEXT> I have a lot of experience with both, personally and anecdotally.  My experience with shrooms has been mostly positive.  I come away from the experience with a renewed sense of wonder and a deeper understanding of my place in the Universe.  I really believe that they help reveal as close to anything that can be called "truth" as possible.

LSD, on the other hand can also be a tremendously powerful experience, and many times the experience is positive, but many times it is not.  It also often leads to great feelings of "revelation".  However, it seems to me that the revelations are much more likely to be false with LSD.  A friend of mine came away feeling like there was no love in the world.  I think it often talks about the same subject as shrooms, but distorts the message.  It makes  sense physiologically for LSD to lead to false epiphanies when you consider that is has a very similar molecular structure to psilocybin.  It's as if it is another key that turns the same lock, but always in some sort of distorted way.

And since this is r/conspiracy, I'll just remind people that [the CIA experimented with LSD in the 1960's as a method of mind-control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are missing my point entirely.  I'm not saying that we one needs to be physically capable of killing an animal to eat it.  What I am saying is that one should be emotionally responsible for their own actions.  When people buy meat in a store that comes from a factory farm they are completely removed from the process that produced the meat and have no idea what sort of suffering was endured.  At least when someone raises and slaughters an animal on their own, they are well aware of what they are doing.  Tribal societies honored the life the animals they killed and treated them with respect.  Animals "raised" for food today are  treated with no respect and in fact are treated legally as property rather than living, sentient beings.  That is fucked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everybody is is saying "oh, it's not so bad! could be worse!" But why are we assuming that it is our right or necessity to eat chicken in the first place?  This is just a small sampling of the torture animals have to endure under factory farming.  I think if you want to eat animals you should be comfortable with killing the animal yourself.  Don't leave it to a big industrialized process that has no regard for humane practices and also leaves you completely removed from the process that delivers the meat to your plate.  I'm not saying no one should ever eat meat, but the way it is done in modern society is completely out of control.  It's literally destroying the planet, destroying people's health, and leaving a trail of misery and suffering along the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A new world is literally a new world and an opportunity to do things completely differently.  Since we are approaching it from somewhere else we can do things after careful though and examination.  No need to rush in to things and much it up.

The very first things we should do is take inventory of the entire planet.   Where are the resources concentrated?  What areas are most suitable of habitation?  The entire thing should be in a database in a computer system so we can use algorithms to help make informed decisions.  We also have an opportunity to switch to renewable energy.  If we concentrate our efforts we can produce a network of a 100% renewable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, etc.

Our goal should be to live an existence that both allows us to thrive and doesn't disrupt the lives of the billions of other species of life on the planet.  Sustainability is key.  We should absolutely leverage the power of machines to do all sorts of repetitive tasks.  I imagine that each city could have an automated garden which would automatically grow and harvest the sustenance we need.

These are just some quick brainstormed ideas, but the point is this would be the perfect opportunity to do things right.  All it would take is the will to work together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ADD is defined by the DSM5 as a psychiatric disorder:
http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/ADHD%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf
In order to "have" ADD one must meet 6 criteria from a small list of behaviors.  Can your behaviors change? Yes. So can you just "get" ADD? According to its definition and that logic, yes.  If you were objecting to my usage of my term at all because you don't feel it is useful or helpful to refer to the meeting of these criterion as a disorder, then we agree!  I simply used it for fun in more of a tongue-in-cheek manner like gay people affectionately call each other "fairies".

Also, there is a lot of ongoing research investigating the neurological effects that the internet may have on our brains: http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/PRN-081015_gary-small-ibrain.aspx
As all repetitive experience does, it has measurable effects on the brain, and very likely changes our behavior, even if in minute subtle ways.  I think this is actually fascinating and I think about the prospects of societies neurological structure changing on a mass scale.  Perhaps something like a new phase of humanity?!

As for marijuana, I know at least some research has indicated a higher prevalence of pot smoking among those with ADD.  Of course, CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION.  It could well be that people who have those symptoms just also happen to like smoking pot =) (Or any other number of explanations.)  But it does seem like some of the things on the ADD list are quite similar to some of the things on the "marijuana intoxication" list.  I think similarly of the internet usage, these changes are not "good" or "bad" or "orderly" or "disorderly" (unless your talking about relative to the status quo, but that's a whole 'nother discussion.)  These characteristics just are, but they can makes a really big difference in the way we live our lives!

Now I'll speak of my personal experience.  I am diagnosed with ADD and I always felt like many of my behaviors weren't detrimental at all, but simply annoying to teachers, like standing in class, and asking tangential questions.  Other behaviors I did want to change, like failing to finish things I was excited to start, and have been pretty successful at doing so.  I smoke pot and I have fun and I get things done.

TL;DR Think about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once in a dream I had a someone show up in my bedroom and asks me to follow him.  He flew out the window and I followed him.  He took me to the backroom of some building where there was a meeting going on.  It was a secret lucid dreamers alliance meeting!

In another dream, I tried to go back there by flying to the building.  I went in through the front which was filled with offices and cubicles.  I tried to make my way to the back where the meeting was and a woman in a suit came out and told me I couldn't go back there.  I told her I had to find out if it were real.  At this point she produced a pistol and pointed it at me! She said forcefully "IT WASN'T REAL"!

It seems to me like there are some dream figure who want the truth to be known (the liberators) and others who want to suppress the truth about the dream state. </TEXT>

<TEXT> REM sleep gets longer as the night goes on, and it can range from 5 minutes to over 90 at the end of the night.  This is why you have your best chance to have a lucid dream at the end of your sleep cycle, and also the longest (lucid) dreams.  Personally, I've had lucid dreams so long I could barely remember how they started and were way too long and detailed to write down completely.

One technique I've learned for extending a dream I feel slipping away is the SPIN technique.  Try spinning in circles.  Often times when you stop you will wake up in a completely different setting. In fact, you can use this technique to teleport by focusing on where you want to be while you are spinning! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do atheists need billboards to proclaim their nonbelief? To somehow even things out?  It is absurd.  It is everyone's right to choose what they believe or don't believe. You DO NOT have to act all butthurt because your belief is not the most popular one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I don't understand about /atheism is why there seems to be a false dichotomy between Christians and Atheists, as if those are the only two options and that the Christian view of God is the only possible one.  Many people have belief in something they call "God" which bears no resemblance to the spiteful, meddling Man in the sky.  It seems like a straw-man argument to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a phone stolen while I was dancing a show.  When I got home, I got on my computer logged into Lookout and saw the phone was about 45 minutes away in a park.  I drove there and then it showed up as being in a house. I decided to come back in the morning and the phone registered as being in between two houses, so I went to each of them and rang the bell.  The first one was a Mom of two teenagers who swore her kids were no where near a club the night before.  The second one was an older lady.  I persuaded her to let me borrow her computer so I could show her where the phone was located.  Finally, she gave me her phone and I called my phone. We heard it ringing in the neighbor's yard next door! (The Mom of the teenagers).  I went back there and the Dad went around to the backyard and retrieved my phone.  The screen was cracked but it was still functional.  It had been locked out from too many pattern lock attempts.  I think someone tried to get it and got fed up so they threw it over the fence into these people's yard.

Amazing that I got it back, and it served me well for another year until I dropped it in my dog's water bowl. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a not a criticism of Ecuador or even of China, but a criticism of a system in crisis.  Yes, Western nations have built up their wealth through the decimation of natural resources, [edit] both [/edit] domestic and abroad.  But this does not mean we should simply sit back and allow the rest of our planet's resources to be destroyed because "they did it first."  This is like raiding a store with the justification that other people have shoplifted.  We need to start thinking GLOBALLY and LONG-TERM if we are to have a future on this planet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was contesting the claim that intuition is a "dangerous idea".  My position is that intuition is real and can point people in the right direction when pursuing truth.  Intuition is the acquisition of information through unconscious sources. I qualify this by saying that although (or "but") it is a legitimate way of moving towards truth, it is not sufficient to serve as evidence in a legal context.  Accepting that hunches can contain truth, they still do not make good evidence because a person could simply be lying about their hunch.  The data which leads to the hunch is not readily available for the public scrutiny because it is very much a personal experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I know there are NO long term physical side effects of taking psilocybin containing mushrooms.  If anyone can find any research which indicates to the contrary, please post.

You need to be aware that frequent psychedelic usage WILL change your personality.  The effects should be mostly beneficial however. =) Also be aware that you may develop a tolerance, and the "specialness" of the experience may subside.  I suggest limiting yourself to monthly for now, since you are a new psychonaut.  Your psyche needs time to adjust to things you will find out about yourself and the universe.

Have fun and peace! </TEXT>
