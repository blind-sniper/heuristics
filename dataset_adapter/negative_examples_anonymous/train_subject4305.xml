When it's done as credit the transaction is stored in the machine, it can be edited and deleted and doesn't go through to the bank until the terminal is closed out at the end of the day and even then the charge still usually takes a few days to go through.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I lost one of my favorite costume pieces this year at burning man. It was a long flowing knee leght vest, almost like a rob of satin or silk like material. It was decorated and looked to be Indian or arab in orgin. I have a feeling that they are very common in certain cultures but I can't find the correct name to look it up. It didn't button up, it was sleevless. Any help is much appreciated. I'll see if I can find a pic of something similar. Thanks peeps. </TEXT>

 My understanding is that it may be my sciatic nerve and that i need to give it time to heal. But this means no deadlift, no squats, no good mornings. what can i do in the meantime to help maintain those lifts and if anyone has had this same problem what can i do to help recovery and how long should i expect to be out game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a grand maul seizure during sex. When I was 24 I had a long term girlfriend and was living at home. Well at one point my doctor and I decide to go off my meds to see if its still active. Well during that time of my med me and my GF are having sex and next thing I know I'm hanging off the bed and I've puked up my dinner. Turns out mid bone I went into a full blown seizure. My GF was aware of my condition but never expected this to happen. She was a champ though. The real awkward part was telling my parents how it went down. But hey now I have a cool story.
