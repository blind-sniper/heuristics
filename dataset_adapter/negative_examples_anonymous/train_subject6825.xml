<TEXT> According to Wikipedia, pump-action shotguns are illegal if they hold more than 5 rounds.

I'm not an expert, but in skimming how the Australian gun laws Wiki page, they break things down into different categories, and the higher the category, the more restrictive the regulations on ownership.

Since this is a lever-action gun, I'm guess that allows it to fall under the least restrictive category, which is what has the antis all pissed off, since it's a technical solution to a bureaucratically-induced limitation.

<TEXT> The old paradigm, says Gross, who has a background in advertising, was keeping certain guns away from all people. (Assault rifles, for example.) The new one, which focuses on background checks, is about keeping all guns away from certain people. (People with criminal records, domestic abusers, the mentally ill.) 

This particular bit of bullshit jumped right out at me. If Dan Gross were the least bit serious about implementing this as a policy stance, the Brady Campaign would be suing the shit out of states and municipalities that have bans on so-called "assault weapons," magazines, and even calling for the feds to repeal GCA '68 and NFA '34.

I also find it highly amusing that the one state-level victory they point to; the background check law in Washington, is not being enforced, and is, by all accounts, being flouted on a continual basis. Yeah, that's a real win there, fella. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 2 million stat is derived from studies undertaken by criminologist Gary Kleck.

His results are on the high side, but not necessarily unrealistic. Other studies have come up with numbers ranging from 60,000 (from the deeply anti-gun and highly partisan VPC) to 500,000, and 1,500,000.

As for people mistakenly using a gun illegally, this seems to be fairly rare, though I'm not aware of any specific studies. You could probably use the conviction rates of concealed carry permittees as a reasonable proxy.

<TEXT> The long-term goal here is to spin up a machine designed to feed credulous members of the media gun control talking points while maintaining the cover of using a supposedly "impartial" source.

Think of it as a news media equivalent of the Bloomberg school of public health, but instead of using the public (and reporters') innate trust of the medical establishment, they're using the cover of being a supposedly impartial media source.

I expect that part of the reason for this is that the public has largely figured out that when the mass media quotes organizations like Brady or VPC in a story that they're lacking in credibility.

There was a similar attempt a number of years back where The Joyce Foundation threw money at academics to attempt to re-write historical and legal precedent on the 2nd amendment to redefine it as a "collective right."

Off the top of my head, the most notable academics to help perpetrate this fraud were Cornell West (yes, the Cornell West that had a bit part in The Matrix 2), and Michael Bellesiles, whose book on guns was so fraught with outright fraud that it essentially destroyed his career. </TEXT>

They're helping to fight the draconian laws that were passed there.

Incidentally, would you care to explain why you think someone should be thrown in prison simply for a grip?

I mean, it seems to be kind of cowardly to want to imprison people because of how they hold an object.

The state's response was that it was perfectly legal to have the magazine so long as you only used it with the cartridges that limited the capacity e.g. .458 SOCOM. 

Putting other cartridges in the magazine that would allow you to load more than the legal limit (.223) would result in a fine and a trip top the slammer. 

It's a perfect example of just how insane these laws actually are.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue, though, is that trying to separate "gun violence" into it's own special category is, in most cases, disingenuous.

Even if you work from the assumption that passing gun control works, and drives down "gun violence," without actually addressing the underlying issues of that violence, all that happens is that alternate methods of inflicting harm are substituted, with no real effect on the rate of overall violence. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Update on my Pro-Rights Charity Donations (Thanks to our trolls for making this happen!) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-31 06:59:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, out of curiosity, I went back and added up all of the donations to various pro-gun organizations that I've donated to in the names of the various graboids that haunt our hallways, and figured some of you guys would be interested in seeing the breakdown.

So here it is:
CALGUNS Foundation: $10

Second Amendment Foundation: $5

Virginia Citizens' Defense League: $5

The Independence Institute: $5

Students for Concealed Carry: $5

CALGUNS Foundation: $10 (I should have just done the $20 donation and reaped some swag...)

The Independence Institute: $5

Oregon Firearms Federation: $5 (and they sent me a couple stickers!)

Texas State Rifle and Pistol Association: $5

NRA-ILA: $10

Second Amendment Foundation: $5


*Total: $70*

I'd like to thank our resident trolls for enabling me to donate a grand total of $70 to various pro-gun organizations. Until now, I've always just been one of those people who sends off $25 once a year to the NRA and then feels vaguely guilty about not doing more to fight for civil rights.

Because of our pet graboids, I've now donated nearly 3x the amount of an annual NRA membership to various organizations working to advance gun rights, including some small, but deserving groups of people.

The old saying is true. Turns out it truly is better to give than to receive.

<TEXT> What an idiotic proposal; even by the already drop-dead moronic standards of the average graboid.

Passing this law would be the death knell of the gun control movement, and here's why.

Let's say that this proposal is magically signed into law by Obama next Monday.

By Wednesday afternoon the NRA would spin up a program whereby they'd offer discounted liability insurance to any gun owner who becomes an NRA member*. 

By Friday morning, the NRA would probably have something like 10 million new members.

Two weeks down the road, their ranks would swell to ~30 million members.

A month later, the rolls would probably stabilize at a total of around 50 million new NRA members, making the NRA easily the biggest, best funded, and most cantankerous grassroots organization in United States political history.

The NRA's war chest would swell to record proportions, and not only would we live in a world where every gun control proposal would be utterly eviscerated, and their advocates publicly humiliated, but you'd end up seeing the repeal of every gun control law back to the Sullivan Act.

Sure, it would leave us in a situation where we'd all have to pay an annual fee for some piddly insurance policy**, but that would be a fairly small price to pay in exchange for being able to order a belt-fed grenade launcher via Amazon (Free shipping for Prime Members!).


*Remember, the NRA already has something of an insurance infrastructure already in place, as they insure most shooting ranges, as well as work with a company to offer insurance plans for gun collections.


**After all, the NRA wouldn't work to repeal the law that vaults them into the political stratosphere. </TEXT>

Hell, my bank account certainly doesn't reach even .0001% of the depths of stupidity regularly exhibited by the anti-gun trolls on Reddit, which is why I figured it would be cool to turn it into a call to action for anyone who wanted, or had the means, to participate.

So donate when you can, but don't beat yourself up if you have more important financial obligations to take care of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Respectfully, I must disagree, especially in this case.

Look at the historical symbolism (going all the way back to General Gadsden and Benjamin Franklin) inherent to using a rattlesnake for a symbol. It's not an animal that goes out of its way to attack; in fact, they're quite content to be left alone, and will typically only strike in self-defense.

Now, compare that to the symbolism that CSGV has added: a bare, human foot attempting to deliberately stomp, to death, an animal that simply wishes to be left alone.

Now, you can argue that this does reflect a facet of humanity, but it's not the "starry-eyed dream version" of humanity you spoke of.

Rather, the facet of humanity CSGV are symbolizing is arguably the worst part of human nature: the drive to dehumanize, outgroup, attack, and kill those who you disagree with. 

This poster isn't a representation of pie-in-the-sky hippy-dippy idealism. It's a representation of a wish to obliterate and kill what they irrationally fear and hate.

The one thing that I find heartening in the whole image is that they were evidently too stupid to bother putting on boots before trying to stomp a poisonous snake to death, which indicates that our foes fly their idiocy and lack of preparation right on their very own flag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For what it's worth, the choice of venue, density of people, limited access to exits, and ability to control the environment by locking or blocking doors seems to play a tremendously significant role in the number of victims in mass shootings. 

Control of the environment is a theme that shows up over and over again in these sorts of incidents, and frankly, is far more worrisome than whether the perp used a scary black gun or "high capacity" magazines. 

TL;DR: The size of the magazine in the gun doesn't give much of a performance boost when you're shooting fish in a barrel.  </TEXT>

All humans make choices based on emotions and feelings at one time or another, and in many cases, an individual may not have the ability or interest to weigh arguments based on logic and reason, and will instead opt to go with a feeling, or gut reaction.

As such, it behooves us to have arguments of all sorts ready to go, be they reasoned, emotional, psychological or sociological.

<TEXT> Believe it or not, Wired published an article on the AR15, and it's a pretty decent primer on why the gun is so popular.

http://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/

The bottom line is that the AR15 is no less dangerous than a regular hunting rifle, as it fires much weaker rounds.

In it's favor, it's a jack of all trades, and dominates a lot of applications from precision competition (Service Rifle, National Match Rifle), to home defense, to Action Sports, to patrol service, and even some hunting applications.

<TEXT>  That part sounds super iffy, because how do you calculate the "burn" for either fat or carbs? I thought cells primarily "burned" glucose, not fat/carbs? Maybe I'm mis-remembering high school bio, but I thought that larger stuff like fat/carb/protein was broken down beforehand into glucose and other simple sugars to be "used"/"burned" by cells?

First off, I'm not an expert, don't have a background in this stuff, and have been trying to get a better handle on it purely as a layman who's interested in improving physical fitness. 

As I understand it, you're correct that the body uses glucose as a fuel for physical activity. However, your body only has a limited store of ready-to-go glucose on hand, and intense physical activity can rapidly deplete this supply.

Once your body's supply of glucose is depleted, in order to continue generating fuel for your exercise, the body has to switch over to breaking down fat and carbohydrates into glucose* that it can then utilize.

Evidently, one way to measure this is to determine what's called your VO2 max, basically the maximum volume of oxygen your body can utilize.

Here's an article that looks like it breaks down the process and machine used for testing that OP is talking about:

<TITLE> Take the /r/progun Charity Troll Challenge! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-30 15:29:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Lately, it seems like the level of discourse around here has gotten worse, and this is due to an influx of graboid trolls who are only interested in disrupting the discussions, instead of actually trying to take part.

The mods here are big believers in the right to free expression, so the trolls don't get banned.

So I've decided to turn the aimless hate and vitriol of our trolls into a positive outlet for the 2nd Amendment.

Every time I come across a post from a graboid troll, I whip out my wallet and make a small donation ($5, or whatever the allowable minimum is) to a pro-gun organization that I pick at random.

Let me tell you, this feels AMAZING. Instead of being upset and crabby at some idiot troll (giving them exactly what they need) I now feel great because I'm helping out others. In fact, so far, our resident troll, tall_liberal2, has been responsible for me donating to the NRA-ILA, the Second Amendment Foundation, the Texas State Rifle Association, and the Independence Institute.

I didn't want to keep it to myself, so I figured I'd throw a post up and see if anyone else would be interested in taking part in a Charity Troll Challenge.

Here are the guidelines:

1.) Upon finding a post from a graboid troll, go to a website for a pro-gun group (bonus points for one that's in a state currently battling against Bloomberg's minions).

2.) Donate whatever amount you wish, via whatever means are available (credit card, paypal, bitcoin, time).

3.) If you can dedicate the donation to someone or leave a comment, say that it's for Reddit User (Troll's username.)

4.) Respond to the troll here by telling them which organization they've helped you donate to, and how much you've donated.

And that's it!

So, who else wants to help fight against trolls and for gun rights? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dang. Look at that, another post from tall_liberal2!

So, I've just donated $5 to the Independence Institute in Colorado. They're currently suing the state over the universal background check law, and working with legislators to loosen the state's useless magazine ban.

Thanks for the reminder that I needed to donate to a pro-gun group! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting article. 

However, I think the issue if even more granular than the author claims. 

Even in states where new gun control laws have passed, (eg Colorado and Washington) it has only been in the face of massive popular opposition from those who don't live in large cities, and even a lot of law enforcement is refusing to enforce these laws.

<TEXT> With high enough round counts, it's theoretically possible for the holes in a receiver that hold the pins for the trigger group to become worn and enlarged, as the pins will rotate and wear on the receiver. 

With enough wear from pin rotation, the holes can become so enlarged that the pins won't stay in place.

This is why KNS makes anti-rotation pins.

<TITLE> Roku 3 Remote Constantly Drops Connection </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-17 05:20:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A couple of weeks ago, my Roku 3 remote stopped functioning.

A search online told me that there's a good chance that the remote had lost the pairing with the Roku, and that there were a couple of easy fixes.

So far I've tried the following:
- Rebooting the Roku
- Rebooting the Roku and holding down the pairing button during startup
- Going into the settings for the Roku and trying to pair the remote
- Pulling the batteries out, leaving them out for a few seconds, and putting them back in.

At best, the remote will have function restored, but only for a short time, before failing again, but in most cases it won't even do that.

The remote appears to have power, as the LED is functioning.

So, anything else I should try, or am I going to have to order a new remote?

Thanks for any help! </TEXT>

No need to register SBRs means no need to pretend that an AR with a short barrel is a pistol instead of a rifle.

If all short-barrelled ARs become, overnight, rifles, it means they can't apply the law covering armor-piercing handgun ammunition to .223. </TEXT>

This lady is a deeply biased gun control advocate using a horrendously flawed methodology to drum up sympathy for the gun control movement.

The fact she'd even claim something like 50,000 US gun deaths demonstrates that she's either a liar or a complete idiot, because the FBI data shows the true number isn't even half of what she claims.

If you're going to claim to be pro-information, you need to be willing to vet your data sources, especially if the data is coming from someone with a clear agenda. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd prefer to skip that process entirely, and just add a simple "no guns" symbol to the state-issued ID of any prohibited person.

Want to sell a gun to someone? Check their driver's license for the icon of a gun with a red slash through it, and you'll know immediately whether the person attempting to buy the gun is prohibited from doing so.

Boom. Instant background check with zero need to pick up a phone or enter data into a website.

Hell, if you want, you could even attach a legal penalty for knowingly selling a gun to someone with a marked license, or to someone who refuses to show ID who turns out to be a prohibited person, and I doubt any gun owners would have a problem with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regulated, as used in the Constitution, is done so in a manner that is anachronistic in the 21st century.

At the time the Bill of Rights were written, the dictionary definition of regulated meant to be well-supplied, maintained, and trained.

So, if you're going to claim you're making an argument from original constitutional intent, I assume you're in favor of allowing citizens to be armed and trained.

On the other hand, if you're using "regulated" in the modern sense, I assume you mean to use the term in a manner that implies forcing people you disagree with politically to be at the beck and call of an onerous bureaucracy.

I would argue that your modern take on it is perhaps a tad bit intellectually dishonest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most mass shooters acquired their guns after completing a background check, so I find it odd you think someone should be imprisoned for selling a gun to a close personal friend who, say, already has a large, legally-owned gun collection, a concealed carry permit, and a clean criminal record.

As for addressing mass shooting events, magazine bans do exactly nothing.

Eric Harris fired nearly two times the number of rounds of Dylan Klebold during Columbine, this despite the fact that he was wielding a gun with ten round magazines, and Klebold had "high capacity" magazines.

The Virginia Tech shooter managed to pull off the worst mass shooting on US soil, and he did it with a mixture of ten and fifteen round magazines, which are completely legal in Colorado.

Even the Sandy Hook shooter didn't bother to empty the magazines he carried, instead opting to execute tactical reloads at opportune times in order to keep the advantage in his favor.

If magazine capacity mattered, there would be a strong correlation between mass shooting events, magazines, and number of people killed, but such a correlation is hard to draw, partially because such events are exceedingly rare, and partially because magazine capacity is pretty far down the list of things that enable a mass shooter.

In order to believe that a magazine ban has any sort of effect, you have to believe the following:

1.) That a magazine ban can be enforced in any meaningful way. Since we're talking about hundreds of millions of devices which are cheap, essentially untraceable, and about as complicated as a travel mug, claiming such a ban is enforceable is clearly delusional.

2.) You have to believe that reloading a firearm is an arduous or difficult procedure. It isn't. Even someone completely new to firearms can be taught to execute a reload in two-three seconds.

3.) You have to believe that in that 2-3 second time interval, a victim will be able to recognize the following:
- That the assailant has run out of ammunition and needs to reload
- Assess the situation
- Choose to either run for an exit or attempt to engage an armed assailant in a physical fight.

And that's all assuming that the assailant isn't using tactical reloads (Sandy Hook), retreating slightly to reload (Virginia Tech), or armed with more than one gun (most every mass shooting.) 


People who think that magazine bans will have some sort of positive effect on violent crime or mass shootings are utterly, completely deluded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps the solution is to get people the help they need rather than stripping them of their civil rights.

Not that you actually care. Magazine bans and background checks do exactly zero to stop someone from committing suicide with a firearm, and the same goes for pretty much all of the other proposals coming out of Camp Gun Control, too.

The issue of suicide is just one that anti-gun advocates use to inflate their numbers in order to claim that there's some sort of crisis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The metric of "gun deaths" is a fundamentally useless one, as it essentially implies that a death that involves a firearm is somehow worse than a death from other means.

Furthermore, it clearly belies the motives of the gun control set as being fundamentally unconcerned with overall violence or suicide rates, and that they're ok living in a world where shootings are replaced with death by other means in a one-to-one relationship.

Furthermore, even going with the lowest reasonable estimates of defensive gun uses, which are approximately 100,000 annually, it's clear that the use and ownership of firearms has an overall positive societal impact, and that's even if you manage to completely ignore all of the positives that come with gun ownership and use for recreational and sporting purposes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's just not financially worth it.

The FFLs are forbidden from charging a market rate for background checks, while still being forced to go through the same process of gathering data, walking the customer through the process, and submitting the information via the NICs system, which will tie up an employee for around an hour or two.

On top of that, they're then required to abide by all of the same record keeping requirements (entering the information into a bound book, keeping the physical 4473 on file for twenty years or more) that they have to abide by for a gun that they actually would have sold.

If any part of that process is done incorrectly, say, a procedural error in how the form is filled out (e.g. the person doing the transfer abbreviated Colorado as CO on the form) the dealer can be punished for the transgression during an ATF inspection.

Given the fact that there's no money in it, the process is a significant time sink, and it comes with a whole host of liabilities, it's really no surprise that dealers are refusing to do these transfers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the average anti-gun activist is a hugely self-important narcissist who has a high likelihood of living in a large city.  

Smoking has been largely regulated and de-socialized to the point where they are unlikely to encounter it, and get upset at being exposed to smoking. 

On the other hand, in the mind of a narcissist, the fact that guns are still legal causes them outrage because if they were to encounter someone with a gun, they would be at a disadvantage. 

The thought of being at such a disadvantage causes them a tremendous amount of mental anguish, which drives them to advocate for stricter gun control.

This irrational mindset is why they are not swayed by facts, logical thinking, rationality, or appeals to basic human rights. 

It's also why they are completely incapable of distinguishing between the average gun owner and a violent criminal. To the anti-gun mindset they are one and the same, merely because both a criminal and a gun owner possess the ability to visit physical harm on them, regardless of whether or not they actually would.  </TEXT>

That means that approximately 0.000099999% of guns are ever involved in the death of a child.

Congratulations, you fail at risk assessment.

<TEXT> Markley's Law
A variant of Godwin's Law: As an online discussion of gun owners' rights grows longer, the probability of an ad hominem attack involving penis size approaches 1.
Person 1: I carry a gun to try to keep my family and I safe by exercising a Constitutionally-protected natural right.

Person 2: Hah! You carry a gun because you have a small penis, and you are trying to make up for it!

Person 1: Well, I guess Markley's Law is still true.

If a gun store goes out of business, all of the 4473s that are under that age limit are relinquished to the BATFE, who warehouses them.

NICS data cannot legally be kept for more than 24 hours due to a lawsuit filed, and won by, the NRA in 2004. You will occasionally see a story in the press lamenting this fact, and dressed up under the guise of "but academic researchers need that data because reasons, and the NRA is a big mean doody head for forcing the feds to adhere to their own law!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> The same exact thing happened in Colorado when it came to light that Magpul was based there.

When it came to light that their stupid law would cost the state hundreds of jobs and measurable amounts of tax revenue, suddenly all of the politicians who had been denouncing "high capacity" magazines as only fit for mass murderers were falling all over themselves to amend the law so Magpul could continue to operate in the state.

So, according to Democrats, "high capacity" magazines are only fit for committing mass shootings, but it's ok to make them in your state so long as the magazines (and the mayhem they surely bring with them) gets exported to other states. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NAGR is an off shoot from the Colorado gun rights org Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. Both organizations are operated by Dudley Brown.

Brown has a well-deserved reputation as a controversial figure, both in the general populace, and among gun owners for his bombastic presentation style "no compromise" tactics and his willingness to attack moderate Republicans as well as the NRA.

In Colorado, he's quite proud of the fact that RMGO candidates often win primaries, but in the larger political landscape, most of his candidates end up being far too conservative to actually have a chance in Hell of winning in districts that aren't solid red territory.

RMGO, and presumably NAGR judge candidates on more than just gun issues, but also include a politician's stance on issues like abortion as well.

If you aren't a staunch social conservative, you'll likely disagreewith some of the positions and endorsements of NAGR. </TEXT>

Furthermore, any and all health issues can easily be dealt with by simply distributing a pamphlet that covers basic gun safety, storage, and cleaning procedures with zero need to actually record such information in a database that can be accessed by an army of medical professionals and faceless bureaucrats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Assault weaponsjust like armor-piercing bullets, machine guns, and plastic firearmsare a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weaponsanything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine guncan only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. In addition, few people can envision a practical use for these weapons."

-Josh Sugarmann, founder of the Violence Policy Center, "Assault Weapons and Accessories in America," 1988

That's just one quote. There are plenty more where that came from. 

A lot of average Joes support gun control because that's what the media and their leaders tell them is good. 

However, at the highest levels, make no mistake, the officials and policy makers who support gun control aren't just simply misinformed. They are outright lying to you, me, and the American people.

To people like Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, gun control is purely an issue of instituting policies that consolidate power in the hands of a wealthy and well-connected political elite.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking very broadly, the "pro" version of a pistol will possibly include the following upgrades:

Longer barrel
Better trigger
Upgraded sights (adjustable and or fiber optic)
Flared magazine well 
Extended magazine release

Which options show up will depend on the make/model of pistol. 

In a lot of cases, terms like "pro," "target," "sport," "competition," and especially "tactical" have been so diluted by marketing hype that they don't really mean anything any more.  </TEXT>

Had he wanted to kill them, he could have easily done so, at his leisure, even with a pump action shotgun. 

Hell, using a shot timer, I've actually run side-by-side drills of firing a pump vs semi-auto shotgun, and the difference in the rate of fire amounted to a couple of seconds. 

A two-second difference to do a mag dump doesn't matter in a situation where the perpetrator has the better part of two days to do as he pleases.  </TEXT>

However, anti-gun groups and officials would remain largely unchanged in their goals because if you get then to answer honestly, they support gun control not because of crime or violence, but because of an over-arching need to exercise control over others. 

Crime is simply the pretext. An obsessive need to control others is the actual reason.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't move goal posts, though I admit I should have perhaps been more specific, as it is the DNC and higher ups in the party that hate private gun ownership, at the state and local levels the democrats tend to be, if not more aligned with their constituents, then at least pragmatic about placating them. 

But any presidential contender for the Democratic party will bow to anti-gun pressure, and that pressure will come from the party bosses, donors, and senior members serving in high-level elected positions. 

Hell, based on the posts here, Webb had tried to play both sides of the fence on background checks, claiming to support them for gun shows, but not other private party transfers. 

I guarantee you that stance, milquetoast as it is, will harden to a full on support for Bloomberg-style mandatory checks.

I will again point to the DNC stance on the 2nd Amendment.

I'm simply pointing out the racist outcome of a law you support.

I'll also note that you've completely failed to articulate why throwing Shaneen Allen in prison is in the best interest of society or safety.

All you've done in this entire thread is make a fallacious appeal to popularity (what's hilarious is that you can't even make that claim, as Ms. Allen was put into a diversion program AFTER a massive public outcry at the injustice of imprisoning her.)

But, hey, you're the one who's already voiced support for making it a felony to run a stop sign on an empty road.

In short, you're a dimwit, and not even your fellow graboid lunatics have tried to make the case that she should be convicted of a felony, because anyone with the least bit of tolerance or empathy can see the injustice of the situation.

Please, continue, as I do so love sharing your posts with others as an example of the pathological narcissism inherent to anti-gun culture. </TEXT>

You said nothing in support of the diversion program, in essence endorsing throwing the book at her. 

Then, in order to demonstrate what a pathetic coward you are, you won't actually defend your position, rather choosing to hide behind a claim that clearly the law is just because the citizens of New Jersey want such a law (which manages to be a fallacious appeal to popularity, as well as a complete non-sequitur).

Either defend your position for imprisoning her, or admit that you are wrong.

However, NICS checks get run for reasons other than gun purchases, such as when people get concealed carry permits, and at least one state, Kentucky, runs NICS checks on all CCW holders once a month, which is going to skew the numbers.

As you point out, it's not a one-to-one relationship, but it's an enormous freaking indicator of just how popular guns are. </TEXT>

It's a little-known fact that Battlefield 4 had this in the beta, but the "filling out ATF Form 4, getting an FBI background check, and waiting 9 months" portion of the game turned out to be hugely unpopular, so in the interest of keeping the game fun, they just gave suppressors an accuracy penalty instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's very odd.

I do have to say, thanks for writing this article. Seeing something like suppressors demystified in a venue geared toward techies is a very positive thing.

I do have one quibble with this bit, though:

Suppressing a rifle while hunting is one thing; the use cases for suppressing pistols are a lot narrower. "That's the hardest one," Schauble said when we asked why anyone would need or want a suppressed pistol. 

Frankly, I think it's pretty easy to justify suppressing a pistol. If you've ever trained someone who's never shot a handgun before, one of the hardest things for a new shooter to overcome is their sensitivity to the noise and recoil of the gun when it fires.

Here you are, telling them to concentrate on the front sight, and taking the time to coach them on proper trigger pull, and for them to be able to do that, they have to overcome the instinctive human reaction to be surprised and a little scared when it results in a very loud noise and movement.

Coaching a completely new shooter is made much, much easier with the addition of a suppressor to a handgun because it removes the most anxiety-inducing part of the whole experience.

It also makes it a lot easier to coach the new shooter, because you don't have to wear hearing protection, which can make it harder for the new shooter to understand.

Again, thanks for this article, overall, it's a really excellent introduction to the topic of suppressors for an audience who may have never seen them outside of the movies or video games. </TEXT>

Furthermore, please explain how your support for throwing people in prison for owning a plastic box doesn't qualify you as a supporter of gun control.

As for your opinion on gun control, your stated support for Magpul's leaving the state, as well as support for the magazine law really says all that needs to be said with regards to your stance on gun control.

There's nothing wrong with being anti-gun. If that's what you believe, at least have the decency and courage to own the position and state your support for those laws unequivocally, instead of trying to hide behind vague wording and innuendo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want reduced recoil and better control with an AR10, there are several things you can do, and here they are in escalating order of complexity:

1.) Get a better compensator. Look at something like the Bennie Coolie Comp or JP Tank Brake.

2.) Install an adjustable gas block. This will allow you to dial in the right amount of gas that gets siphoned off to cycle the gun.

3.) Install a low-mass bolt carrier, like the one offered by JP.

4.) Install a buffer with tungsten weights.

5.) Shoot light-weight bullets. 135 grain bullets will go a long way to taming recoil on an AR10.

6.) Employ proper shooting technique.

7.) Get in the gym and lift weights. Seriously.

Despite the fact that they look like an AR15, AR10s are a completely different animal. In a stock configuration, they can and will have a much heavier recoil impulse than a stock AR15.

However, if you put the time and effort in to tailoring the rifle's operating system and ammunition, you can reduce recoil by a tremendous amount.

A few months ago, I had the opportunity to shoot an AR10 that had most of the modifications done that I've listed above, and it was almost as low-recoil as shooting a JP CTR-2.

Double taps were extremely easy, and the rifle handled very, very well. So AR10 recoil can be tamed, it just takes effort. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If they actually cared about stopping criminals, they'd work to implement a simple and inclusive plan that would enlist gun owners in *helping* to prevent criminals getting their hands on guns, rather than treating all gun owners like criminals.

For example, most states mark the driver's licenses for people who are under 21 so it's easy for anyone to ascertain at a glance whether they are of legal drinking age.

Implementing a similar plan where everyone's ID is marked so that someone who is  looking to sell a gun can learn whether the person they're dealing with is a prohibited person or not would be far more effective, cheaper, and easier to implement than the so-called "universal background check" schemes that have been pushed by the likes of Bloomberg.

Unfortunately, this isn't actually about preventing criminals from getting guns. If it were, they would actually bother to prosecute the thousands of NICS checks that come back negative on convicted and violent prohibited persons every year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I have a few concerns about the legislation you evidently support.

Does it address the problems that were seen in the Colorado and Washington laws?

You know, like how those laws would make you a criminal for loaning a rifle to a friend for a hunting trip or competition?

Does it fix the prices on background checks, thereby ensuring that no gun dealers will actually be interested in conducting background checks on any transfers except for the ones they conduct on the guns they sell in their shops?

Does it address issues like what happened in Colorado last year when it turned out flood victims who had lost their homes were inadvertently criminalized for transferring their gun collections to friends for safe keeping?

Does it make it a crime to let someone handle a firearm without a background check at a venue other than on a gun range operated by a for-profit enterprise, thereby criminalizing you if you loan your gun to a buddy at a range operated by a non-profit (as most shooting clubs are), on public land, or on private property?

Does the proposed legislation inadvertently discriminate against couples in non-traditional marriages by prohibiting transfer of a firearm without a background check between gay or lesbian couples, while allowing the same sorts of transfers to occur between heterosexual couples?

Does the legislation you support include common-sense exemptions on transfers, for example, those who've already successfully passed a background check in order to acquire a concealed carry permit?

In short, would you care to share the text of the actual legislation that you feel so strongly about?


Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guns in the hands of criminals facilitate murder and other crimes. Guns in the hands of responsible people facilitate suicide. Guns in the hands of irresponsible people facilitate accidents. Even self-defense killing is far from desirable. Even responsible gun owners put others at risk when they fire in self defense.

And yet, guns are fired hundreds of millions of times more per year for reasons that are completely legal than they are used for mayhem.

Of course, you also don't want to breach the fact that they're used for self-defense and defense of others around 1-2million times per year.

Furthermore, in your zeal to hate on gun owners, and your wish to disarm them, you demonstrate that everyone who posts here, who's ever used a firearm in self defense, is someone who you wish was dead.

<TEXT> Of course it does. But you're neglecting the net effect of guns, which is to make everyone less safe.

Except they don't. What's it like being wrong *all* the time? Does your mother dress you in the morning?

Since I am not making an argument based on the contents of any instruction manuals, this isn't really a good point.

It's perfectly relevant, because you don't even understand the most basic facts of a subject you claim to be an expert on, and your lack of understanding, real-world experience, or even an open-minded willingness to engage in a forthright dialogue (as opposed to pathetically sub-par trolling) only manages to underscore the fact that you are clearly as ignorant as you are opinionated.

Frankly, I'm a bit embarrassed for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ability to use a gun in self-defense does make one safer, and frankly, I don't think that someone who's never taken the time to actually read the instruction manual that comes with a firearm are qualified in any way, shape, or form to pontificate on who should, or should not, be prohibited from owning a gun. </TEXT>

Draft the legislation, get it passed and put in the books, so that way when the Bloomberg money machine rolls into town to try to pass more onerous restrictions regarding background checks, the response will be a collective shrug followed by a "we already passed a background check gun bill last year."

<TEXT> Once upon a time, I was in a pawn shop where an old guy was trying to buy a gun.

I over heard the conversation between him and the clerk, and it turned out he had marked down that he'd been dishonorably discharged from the military, and had marked that down on the 4473.

The clerk told him he couldn't sell him a gun, and sent him on his way.

Do I think that this particular sad old man should have been sent to prison?

Of course not.

But what's the point of having a law on the books, especially a law that would let you catch criminals with violent histories dead to rights for trying to acquire the means to commit violence if no one is going to throw them in prison for it?

The lack of enforcement on that front is an utter embarrassment to the entire structure of the NICS system, and no one wants to point this out (or, at least here, pedants want to dick around with semantic word games.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now you're shifting goal posts.

You started out pointing out that 1/3 of NICS checks that fail do so for erroneous reasons.

Of course no one this side of Michael Bloomberg would advocate throwing those people in jail.

Furthermore, studies have shown that the prosecution rates for NICS violations are very, very minimal, and that includes prohibited persons who've committed violent felonies.

If the powers that be were half as concerned about stopping criminals from getting guns as they claim, that would be a really easy way to stop it right there.

Even if there is no fraud, the system is functionally broken because the signature verification method is woefully inadequate for verifying ballots cast by people other than the intended recipient.

<TEXT> Funny you should mention that. 

I voted for Udall specifically because of his stance on abortion. 

After all, women who are conservative or libertarian are not as likely to have an abortion as women who are leftists. 

As a result, liberalized abortion laws and free or subsidized abortion can only work in the long-term favor of the pro-liberty outlook. 

:-)

In fact, since you have stumbled upon the notion of aborting your political adversaries before they can do you the disservice of saying things on Reddit that make you dispeptic, I've actually given you an upvote.

Congrats, Oscar! 

A winner is you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its already illegal to sell a gun to a prohibited person. Even without a UBC law, your scenario would play out pretty much the same, with both criminals going to jail. 

If you actually gave a shit about reducing gun crime, you'd actually make it easier for anyone to conduct a background check and simply allow anyone to submit a NICS request without forcing them to go through an FFL, or you'd mandate that government issued IDs should be conspicuously marked so that anyone can ascertain the legality of the purchaser at a glance in the same way that licenses are marked to easily tell if someone is of legal drinking age or not. 

Of course, as a supporter of gun control, you're completely  incapable of seeing gun owners as anything other than an adversary to mock and harass, so it wouldn't actually occur to you too treat then as anything other than untrustworthy potential criminals, rather than as people who have a vested interest in reducing violent crime, and who could be allies in achieving that goal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tl;dr: your stats can be right, but you can still use them to lie. 

This is one of my favorite tactics employed by the advocates of gun control because it's a very clever tactic of using a lie by omission in order to support the typical left-wing tactic of outgrouping those you dislike. 

It's actually quite clever, but I'll do my best to unpack their argument and point out the flaws. 

The thing you should take note of is that the article only talks about a decline in one thing: the rate of gun ownership. 

Nowhere does it mention a decline in the raw numbers of gun owners, and there's a very good reason for that: solo long as they stick to talking about rate, they're right. 

However, trying to claim a decline in raw numbers would be a lie. 

Let's break it down with a simple example. 

Let's say you have a town with a population of 100, and 45 of the people in that town are gun owners, which gives you a gun ownership rate of 45%.

In the next year, the town's population grows to 150, and the number of gun owners grows to a total of 60. If you run the numbers, you'll see that the town now has a gun ownership rate of 40%, which is a decline of 5%.

In the next year, let's say the town's population grows to 200, and the number of gun owners grows to a total of 70. Running the numbers, we find that gives us a gun ownership rate of 35%, yet another 5% drop from the previous year, and a whopping 10% drop from the first year! 

But if we look at the growth of just gun owners from year one to year three, we see that the number of gun owners have grown by 55.5%!

How can this be? 

Well, the overall population is almost always going to grow faster than any underlying sub group, whether that's gun owners, runners, or people into collecting Pokemon. 

For the overall rate of gun owners to show a positive rate of growth, it would be necessary for there to be a great percentage of new gun owners than new people, PLUS an added number of people on top of that too push the rate past equilibrium. That's pretty unlikely to happen, no matter what sub group you choose.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming your information is correct, its completely possible for the general population to grow faster than the specific subset of the population that are gun owners.

As a result, it's quite possible that the numbers of gun owners to be growing, but the statistics would make that group appear to be shrinking because the population of gun owners is growing at a slower rate than the overall population.

There are plenty of other indicators that you're wrong as well. For instance, the numbers of people getting concealed carry licenses continue to grow, safety classes for first-time gun buyers are routinely filled to capacity, and new shooting ranges are being constructed at an explosive rate.

If the ranks of gun owners are shrinking, then you wouldn't see any of those things happening. </TEXT>

If they've got a valid permit, it shows that they've successfully passed a criminal background check in the past and that they've got a clean criminal history.

I'm not making stuff up. Do you honestly think the average cop is going to be aware enough of the law that they're going to say "Oh, well, that's ok, because I'm a walking copy of "Black's Law Dictionary" and I'm completely aware of all of the exceptions."

No, of course not. They'll cuff you, and haul your ass in and let a judge determine if you were in violation of the law or not. 

"Entrap" does have a specific meaning that doesn't apply, here.

Fine. Harass will work just as well. That said, grammar pedantry is one of the laziest forms of trolling.

Lol. I just don't believe in the conventional pro-gun circle jerk group-think, is all. So, of course, any contrary (or contrarian) opinion must be an anti-gun troll.

Except you actually are a troll, as clearly evidenced by the fact that you consistently support idiotic things like a law that would make it a crime to fail to report a gun within an extremely short period of time.

Such laws, with no history of demonstrating measurable or significant decreases in violence, and being unenforceable against violent criminals who will simply flaunt it, serves only to act as a way to harass citizens who are only guilty of exercising a civil right.

Of course, if you actually aren't an anti-gun troll, you're certainly welcome to post links to demonstrate otherwise.

<TEXT> I can't see how this is "anti-gun", exactly, but

You leave town on vacation for two weeks. Unbeknownst to you, a criminal breaks into your home, compromises your safe and steals your guns on the first night you're out of town. 

You don't find out the guns are missing until after you return from your vacation, and upon reporting the stolen firearms to the police, you are arrested for failing to report the guns stolen within the 72 hour time frame. 

That is just the most obvious example of how such a law is clearly meant to harass and entrap legal gun owners. 

Your inability to see the inherent and obvious problems with such a law shows that you're clearly one of two things; an anti gun troll, or a blithering dipshit of the first order*.

Lead exposure from shooting is easy to mitigate by shooting at an outdoor range, or an indoor range with OSHA-compliant ventilation.

Other than that, following basic hygiene principles like washing your hands and refraining from eating while at the range will easily reduce lead exposure to safe levels.

Of course, if you've got proof of an epidemic of lead poisoning occurring among shooters involved with various junior programs, I'd certainly like to see it. </TEXT>

In the case of a Romney presidency, even assuming Romney would have signed a new AWB, you can be sure that the same strategy would be applied on down the line from the most senior Republican senator to the most junior freshman Republican House Rep.

From a strategic standpoint, it will always be in the interest of the NRA to participate in political races and to back the most likely winners.

The game is the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The NRA is going to support the candidate who is
1.) Most likely to win.
2.) Support gun rights.

Romney was and is anti-gun, but there's a strategy to the NRA's support for him. The NRA has a lot of money to buy ads that are favorable to a candidate like Romney. They're also able to turn out a significant number of highly engaged voters during election time.

So, let's imagine if the election had turned out differently and Romney had actually beaten Obama:

A guy like Romney may be an outright psychopath and a gun grabber, but he's not stupid. Once the election is won, all of those millions of dollars in ad buys and millions of NRA votes are accounted for.

When a gun control law ends up on the President's desk, the NRA is going to have a little conversation along the lines of "Hey, Mitt, remember all those commercials we ran for you, and positive coverage we gave to you in our media outlets, and all of the NRA members who showed up at the polls for you? Well, we did you a solid, and now it's your turn to do us a solid and veto that bill."

Even though a guy like Romney doesn't care about gun rights or gun owners, all of the support given to him by the NRA makes for a compelling reason to veto any bills the NRA doesn't like.

And of course, there's always the implied threat. "Hey, Mitt, we supported you when you needed us, if you don't do the same, well, we'll make sure you can't win the next primary."

So, from that standpoint, it's much more advantageous for the NRA to strategically support candidates who are likely to win, even if they aren't the perfect pro-gun candidate, because their support buys a lot of influence and clout, and even if that candidate isn't a fan of gun rights, he's well aware of the fact that NRA support makes it easier for him to win elections.

TL;DR: It's better to support a winner you can negotiate with, than a loser who's completely on your side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then why do they never differentiate between lawful gun owners and criminals when drafting gun control laws? 

It's either as I describe, or, the only other option is that leftists are so utterly narcissistic that they actually believe they are likely to be victimized by lawful gun owners and feel the need to preemptively disarm them. 

One wonders what sort of things the left is up to if they subscribe to a paranoid belief that their behavior could get them shot by a mild-mannered non-criminal citizen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> tl;dr:
Progressive ideology is rooted in tearing down old institutions and reshaping society in new and novel ways. Progressives hate gun ownership because it represents longstanding traditions, and your responsible gun handling will not dissuade them from hating you. Progressives are willing to cover for extremist Islam because it's new and novel to them, and the fact that it's non-western automatically makes it better than modern western civilization.

As a result, leftists will happily act as ambassadors for extreme Islam because it's new and novel, but will never, ever willingly acknowledge that there are positives to gun ownership because it's old and western.

----------------------

"Progressives" will always hate gun owners, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with your safe gun handling and everything to do with the philosophical underpinnings of liberal ideology, many of which are informed by the ideals of Marxism (during much of the early 20th century) and Postmodernism (late 20th century to now).

Left wing philosophy is fundamentally built on the notion that those things which have existed in society for long periods of time are fundamentally flawed, and must be torn down and done away with to make way for ideas, laws, and culture that are novel and new.

Among progressives, an understanding of history or *why* things have been done a certain way is unimportant. What the philosophy boils down to is "new is always better."

You can see this in nearly all forms of left-wing thinking, from economics (tear down capitalism) to feminism (tear down "the patriarchy") to environmentalism (tear down modern society) and on and on. Note that the outcomes from many of these changes aren't necessarily bad in and of themselves.

As such, gun owners are representative of a longstanding civil rights tradition that is deeply intertwined with the founding of the country. As such, civil rights, as embodied by the Bill of Rights, are completely anathema to the ideals of progressivism, and given that gun rights are steeped in traditions that are embedded into the founding of this nation, the average progressive has nothing but loathing for anyone who chooses to own a gun, and outright hatred for those who choose to do so for reasons that they don't personally approve of. The fact that you are responsible with your firearms *just simply doesn't matter to them because what they hate is the fact that guns are a very old school representation of a society they want to change in fundamental ways.*

So, in a nutshell, this is why leftists fundamentally oppose gun ownership and will never, ever recognize or care about the 99.995% of all gun owners are safe and responsible.

So what about the left's apologist stance regarding Islamism?

Well, if your default philosophical outlook is informed by the Postmodernist belief that your entire society is wrong about pretty much everything all of the time, and Multiculturalism has trained you to believe that all societies are equal, and that you, as a westerner, cannot possess the ability to reasonably articulate or even form valid criticism of other cultures, it becomes very easy for you to look outside of your own culture to find novel ways to inform your motives for implementing change in your society. (Remember, Progressive ideology is founded on novelty-seeking behavior and largely assumes that new = good and old/established = bad.)

Criticism of Islamism is a perfect example of where modern leftist ideology goes astray. In Islamism, you have a culture that is deeply rooted in beliefs that are brutally violent, horrendously racist and misogynistic, deeply subservient to religious authority, and aggressively willing to stamp out open inquiry and reason. Despite all of these plainly obvious drawbacks, Progressives will refuse to criticize, or in many cases, even acknowledge these problems because extremist Multicultural ideals have conditioned them to believe that criticizing other cultures is racist or can only flow from a place of western ignorance.

Because Islamism is foreign and strange to a westerner, it has the appearance of being novel and new to progressives, and since new always = better, you end up in a situation where supposedly forward-thinking intellectual types willingly act as apologists for a brutally violent and backward ideology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Baking soda can be used to attenuate blood acidity, or acidosis. It gets included in a lot of workout supplements because it has some ability to mitigate "the burn" felt from intense exercise.

It's notable that the article doesn't mention the downsides to taking baking soda, which can politely be described as gastrointestinal distress, or more graphically described as inducing diarrhea and vomiting.

It can also cause problems for people with hypertension or those prone to panic attacks.

I suppose its something that might conceivably be used as part of a cancer treatment, if acidosis is a symptom or side effect of cancer or chemotherapy, but that's speculation on my part, and the author's claims that it's some kind of miracle cure are downright criminal.

If you're bored and want to read up on baking soda, then go here for all the fun you can possibly handle:

<TEXT> The Makarov is a pistol that utilizes a straight blowback design to cycle the gun.

As a result of the design, there are no Makarovs that use 9x19mm as the cartridge generates too much pressure to safely use a straight blowback operating system. Also, despite the fact that both 9x18 Makarov and 9x19mm are ostensibly 9mm cartridges, there actually is a difference in the diameter of the bullets (.365 caliber vs. .355 caliber.)

Years ago, I read a magazine article where they attempted to fire 9x19mm through a Makarov with some unpleasant side effects, including a tremendous amount of felt recoil and the brass being battered to death. The authors explicitly stated that shooting 9x19 in a Makarov was a bad idea.

There were a number of Maks that were made to fire .380ACP, however, and these can sometimes be found on the secondary market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to Wikipedia, the molecular formula for Sarin is C4H10FO2P.

If you want to ban the chemical precursors of Sarin nerve gas, you're going to have to throw everyone in jail who has in their possession any of the following: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, flourine, or phosphorous.

Given that all humans are carbon-based life forms, that right there should be enough to trip your "imprison anyone with a precursor for Sarin" law.

God forbid they want to drink a glass of water. The average glass of water has both Hydrogen and Oxygen, and in many places, Flouride (an anion of Flourine.) In your world, you'd be calling out the bomb disposal squad and breathless media reporters every time anyone got the least bit parched.

Of course, I guess you'll have to throw all farmers in jail, since Phosphorus is a common ingredient in fertilizer, to say nothing of it's myriad industrial applications, and the fact that it's present in practically all matches.

<TEXT> I realize that you're an idiot, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't project your stupidity on me.

Of course there are forms of rape that don't involve direct physical violence or the threat of violence; drugging someone or taking advantage of someone who's drunk themselves into a stupor are clearly two examples of this.

But you must be completely touched in the head if you think that you can change the behavior of the kind of psychopath who'd rape a blackout drunk college coed by forcing them to sit through a 60-slide Power Point presentation that outlines the do's and don'ts of when it's ok to stick your dick in someone.

The kind of morals that will prevent someone from taking advantage of another person in such a situation get laid down and reinforced in childhood. Of course, leftist idiots in this country have done everything they can to disassemble the notion of instilling morals and ethical behavior into children, and then they get all butthurt 20 years later when their idiotic methodologies lead to 20-something dudebros who don't have any ethical problems with rape.

Of course, that's all fine and dandy so long as someone can get a financial grant to go out and show the aforementioned slide deck to the aforementioned dudebros, isn't it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm only in favor of UBC's if they are conducted as follows:

Government-issued drivers licenses are conspicuously marked in one of two ways:

People who can legally buy a gun have an icon on their id of a little green circle with a pistol in the center. 

People who are prohibited from owning a gun have an icon on their id of a pistol with an international no symbol over it. 

When selling a gun, you simply ask to see the buyer's id. If you see the green icon, you're good to go. If you see the red icon you are legally required to decline the sale. 

This UBC method empowers gun owners to be the first line of defense in making sure guns aren't sold to criminals, requires no government bureaucracy, does not force buyers or sellers to have to waste time driving to an FFL, or waste money forcing them to pay fees to conduct a check.  </TEXT>

They are also one of the largest competitions shooting organizations, with NRA-sponsored shooting matches in every state. 

On top of that, they offer consultation on range construction, evaluation and grants for the building and improvement of shooting ranges. 

They also offer members insurance on their gun collections.

After all, federal law prohibits the government from retaining NICS check records for more than a week (iirc), so it would be impossible to prove whether someone did or did not submit to a NICS check. 

So this law is completely unenforceable and utterly useless, except to act as the groundwork for further restrictions down the road.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After California passed their state level ban on so-called "assault weapons" it turned out that they left a certain model of SKS off of the list.

Since the window to register them had closed, and they were now considered an "assault weapon " anyonewho had one was told to turn it in or have it confiscated.

I don't know how actively they pursued the owners of those rifles, but its my understanding that some forced confiscations did occur.

There is also a concerted effort in California to match gun registration information up against prohibited persons databases, and then they dispatch LE to confiscate the guns. I don't have a problem with this, at least for people with violent felonies, but they're also going after people who have mental health issues, and even family members who are legal to own guns, but who live with someone who is a prohibited person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While this isn't strictly gun-related, I thought it was worth sharing because it shows that the world is more complex than most gun control fans think, and that it's completely possible that there are factors other than gun availability that play into violence and suicide. 

Given the revelation that high amounts of environmental lead were likely a large part of high crime rates through the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, it seems plausible and reasonable that other chemical and environmental factors could be related to violent behavior or mental disorders.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> None of your points matter to him because for him, gun violence is just the friendly cause he's using to mask hits actual hatred for all gun owners. 

You see, combat effective is both deeply fearful and wildly self-absorbed, and as a result, he believes that anyone who holds the capacity to kill him actually would do so given half a chance. 

As a result of this fear and paranoia, he supports laws that punish lawful gun owners for no reason other than the fact that they make him afraid and uncomfortable. 

This is why anti-gun people are so irrational, and it also explains why they added completely incapable of differentiating between someone who owns a gun for legitimate reasons, and someone who is a violent criminal. 

To him, deep down inside, we're all violent criminals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While some people get all up in arms about cops with modern rifles and pistols, I don't have a problem with it. The problem with police militarization is one of mindset (us vs. them) and not an issue of whether a cop has a wood or plastic-stocked patrol rifle.

As for cops practicing head shots, I'm fairly certain most police academies practice head shots, and have done so since time immemorial. The notion of criticizing cops for practicing shots that require precision is, frankly, utterly idiotic.

The problem is that the article is trying to draw a connection between a competition that will actually help cops have better and safer gun handling, and a militarized police state and/or cases of police using excessive force. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, they've known that for years. The anti-gun crowd learned how to play the incremental infringement game starting in the 1900s. 

Now that much of the populace has gotten wise to their shenanigans, they're having to shift which strategy they use.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From where I sit, the proposal to regulate semi-auto guns under the NFA, or requiring a permit to own one has two long-term goals: to invalidate the Common Usage litmus test spelled out in Heller (after all, if they make it more inconvenient to own a certain class of gun vs. another, most people will default to the easier choice out of sheer convenience.)

This will have the effect of making semi-auto firearms much less common, and therefore likely to fail the Common Usage test in Heller, which then opens the door to further regulation. (Oh, and hey, since you required registration to own those guns, it becomes much easier to pass new regulations governing who can own them and how they can be used!)

TL;DR: CAP to gun owners: C'mon, how about just the tip? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's interesting reading.

Of particular note is their prescription for requiring the registration of so-called "assault weapons."

Basically, they want to re-categorize semi-auto firearms as Title II NFA guns, and force you to jump through the same hoops for an AR15 that you would have to jump through to get a full-auto M16.

This doesn't mark a change of heart for the left regarding gun control; rather, it's just a change in tactics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience, the vast majority of ardent anti gun people suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

Logical arguments don't hold any sway over them because the very nature of your gun ownership personally offends them on a visceral level.

Since their motivations are purely emotional and deeply selfish, facts, stats, figures, and appeals to logic and reasoned thinking will not sway them in the least.

It also turns out that this is a two-way street. Since facts don't have any power to change how they think, they will not consider fact-based arguments to be effective, so they emotionally lash out instead.

Ultimately, the name calling is just an attempt to outgroup you in order to make themselves feel better. </TEXT>

Doses were 10g sodium bicarbonate, 800mg ECGC and 12.5 Mg yohimbine hcl.

Other supps are D3, zinc, and creatine.

About half an hour after, I had an intense bout of puking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To make a crappy analogy then, it's sort of similar to having a computer with a really powerful graphics card. 

A normal human's vision system (graphics card) isn't all that high tech, so it just hands the stimulus off to the brain (processor), which is pretty to of the line, for interpretation. 

But in a mantis shrimp the vision system (graphics card) is a top of the line model that can handle a lot of that work locally without having to hand the stimulus to the primitive brain (processor) for interpretation, which probably cuts down on the amount of time the brain needs to make a decision as to whether it's seeing food (attack) or a threat (run). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the antis are so in favor of the sale of smart guns, perhaps they should give a little, too.

-Industry immunity to protect from lawsuits like the ones in the story.
-Repeal the NJ "mandatory smart gun" law.


Heck, since the gun lobby can negotiate from a position of power on this one, maybe they should demand concealed carry reciprocity, and repeals on magazine bans, hollow-point bans, and other ridiculous gun control laws.

If the antis want smart guns on the market so badly, maybe they should compromise for once. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He feels strongly about guns because he's deeply afraid of them.

Even worse, he's deeply afraid of the inherent symbolism they represent, which is individual autonomy and responsibility.

He's not interested in "saving lives," rather, he's interested in scoring points in a culture war where doing things that piss off people who aren't from his tribe makes him feel good.

<TEXT> The problem is that there's no way for the system to stop someone who's suffering from undiagnosed mental illness.

Your name doesn't go into the NCICS prohibited persons list unless you've been involuntarily committed or legally adjudicated as mentally ill.

In the case of a lot of states, they don't even bother to report those people to the national-level organization responsible for maintaining the NCICS list, so in some cases even people who should have a record in NCICS don't, and are still able to buy guns. (The Virginia Tech shooter is one example of that particular systemic failure.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not necessarily true.

There have been laws proposed that would put people on the NCICS prohibited persons list for having a mental illness diagnosis of any sort.

This, most notably, resulted in an outcry from people who believed it to be unfair that they would lose the ability to exercise a civil right for being stigmatized for seeking treatment for a mental disorder despite the fact that they were not violent.

<TEXT> I'm not a historian, but the movie "Destination Moon" might allude to an answer to your question.

The movie deals with the challenges of conducting a manned expedition to moon.

At one point early on in the film, religious objections to space travel are brought up, only to be summarily dismissed by the protagonists.

The scene seemed so obviously didactic, and out of place to my modern sensibilities that it seemed like the film makers were making an earnest attempt to address something that must have been part of the cultural debate at the time.

I watched the movie probably ten years ago, and that scene still sticks with me today because it came across as so utterly weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way I see it, there are two options:

1.) They grossly over-inflated the number of transfers made per year in order to justify their idiotic law and to get funding for a bloated new bureaucracy.

or

2.) People are just completely disobeying the law. Those who are selling guns to known prohibited persons don't care about the law, and everyone else simply doesn't feel like dealing with the inconvenience of hunting down an FFL to transfer a gun to a friend who they know has a clean background.

In either case, it's a fairly damning indictment. The Dems who pushed for this law have egg all over their face. </TEXT>

As it turns out, Allens case isnt unusual at all. Although white people occasionally do become the victims of overly broad gun laws (for example, see the outrageous prosecution of Brian Aitken, also in New Jersey), the typical person arrested for gun crimes is more likely to have the complexion of Shaneen Allen than, say, Sarah Palin. 

**Last year, 47.3 percent of those convicted for federal gun crimes were black  a racial disparity larger than any other class of federal crimes, including drug crimes.** *In a 2011 report on mandatory minimum sentencing for gun crimes, the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that blacks were far more likely to be charged and convicted of federal gun crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences.*

Buy a quality gun, like a used Glock. Long term, the extra couple hundred bucks won't matter and you'll end up with a much better gun. 

If you are so strapped for cash that a decent gun is out off the question, then you should reconsider buying a gun chambered for one of the more expensive cartridges available.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not so, given that the historical record of gun control is one rooted in the oppression of minorities, most specifically African Americans.

After all, the history of American gun control is irrefutably rooted in the era of the racist antebellum south.

As for these laws being unenforceable, then the laws should be outright repealed.

After all, just because the law is unlikely to result in a conviction doesn't mean the law can't be used against someone to make their life a living hell (having to deal with being arrested, tried, fined and/or imprisoned until the court date, to say nothing of the fact that anyone charged would have to retain a lawyer, miss work, and deal with the stress of being dragged through the legal system.)

Even if there isn't an attempt to maliciously prosecute someone by charging them with a violation that's unlikely to stick in court, there's also the general chilling effect that it has on the average lawful citizen's rights to own and use firearms for self-defense, recreation, and other moral and legal applications.

If you acknowledge the laws serves no purpose, then you should support repealing them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the fact that the law isn't enforceable is probably the prime reason for why it should be repealed.

In fact, even people who aren't into gun rights (or who actually do support gun control) should call for the law to be repealed because it's such an unenforceable, poorly-written mess.

Frankly, if anything, gun control advocates should be *more* vocal about repealing the magazine ban, because the longer it's on the books, the more stupid they look. </TEXT>

The motivation for gun control has nothing to do with violent crime*, and everything to do with scoring points by sticking it to a constituency that progressives reflexively hate.

From what I've read, anything that claims to boost your body's testosterone levels above the natural levels is either marketing bs or steroids.

<TEXT> The first study was roundly dismissed for cherry picking data, and is evidently a statistical outlier, as it was the only state to see this effect. 

http://humanevents.com/2014/03/02/lott-to-gp-johns-hopkins-gun-violence-study-flawed-twisted/

The second study is a tautology, and shows no correlation to a drop in overall violent crime, only "gun crime" which implies that in the absence of a firearm, criminals aren't less violent, but are happy to substitute other methods that are presumably just as effective. 

In any event, the study is behind a pay wall, so we can't even see what sort of criteria they used or what laws were specifically evaluated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there were facts showing these laws to be a net societal benefit, the advocates for them did a poor job of presenting their case when they instead opted to rely on culture war stereotypes, appeals to emotion, procedural shenanigans designed to minimize dissent, and outright misinformation. 

Furthermore, if the laws were effective, the would be plenty of proof of this from the states that have similar laws in place, as well as from the Federal law that was in place from 1994-2004.

Unfortunately, the is no compelling evidence that the laws worked, and your justification is the political equivalent of a creationist who makes a "God of the gaps" argument. 

This gives rise to the problem of now having laws on the books that don't actually reduce violence, but do create a legalistic mine field for citizens who wish to stay on the right side of the law.

The only one the democrats paid any attention to was when it was pointed out that their shiny new magazine ban would outlaw great grandpappy's huntin' shotgun, and then there was a mad dash to amend the law before it became an outright gun ban. 

If you're truly interested, the video from the Senate and House hearings should still be on the websites for those respective legislative bodies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not an opinion to point out that nearly every mass shooter successfully passed a background check, and that the current law would not have stopped people like the Aurora theater shooter. 

Its not an opinion to point out that the magazine ban is useless because it is unenforceable and easily circumvented. 

Nor is it an opinion to point out that the background check law won't stop someone from selling a gun to a criminal nor does it do anything to stop straw purchases. 

Sure, we can quibble over whether the laws put undue burdens on lawful citizens, and certainly those beliefs are largely a matter of opinion, but the bottom line is that the laws were poorly conceived and unlikely to result in measurable public good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Loughner was shooting people at contact distance and was taken down when his gun jammed, not when he was reloading. 

So your one and only example of a shooting where limited capacity magazines might have made a difference is pretty much a useless data point. 

Your claim is clearly counter-balanced by all of the mass shooters who clearly had no problems killing many people despite their limited capacity guns.  </TEXT>

Never mind the fact that a magazine ban will have no effect on the outcome of a mass shooting event. 

What your argument boils down to is that you're willing to arrest, try, convict, and imprison tens of millions of lawful citizens simply because they own a plastic box with a spring in it.

<TEXT> I didn't twist your words, you mouth-breathing imbecile.

The bottom line is that TSA has never, not once, stopped a terrorist, and there's no evidence that they're any more effective than pre 9-11 security, especially given that they have such a tremendous failure rate.

Furthermore, the fact that TSA does actually manage to find a gun now and then, or a shampoo bottle that holds more than 3 oz. is hardly indicative of their utility.

In case you hadn't noticed, this is the USA, and a lot of people here own a lot of guns, and, frankly, the way the TSA trots them out like they're any sort of proof to justify their phoney-baloney jobs is utterly laughable.

The way TSA agents react to the finding of even a single shell casing (or toy gun) like they've just found a case full of plutonium is laughable.

As for actual guns, yeah, people forget that they may have one in a bag, and yet they do it less regularly than TSA forgets about their own protocols for being able to legally fly with firearms.

But, yes, please do continue to justify feeling up toddlers, your posts amuse me. </TEXT>

What's it like being the kind of person that defends a useless federal organization that spends most of it's time finding ways to justify touching children and attractive women?

<TEXT> I love when they make that argument, frankly, because it means that you've won.

Here, let me explain:

The people who make that argument aren't giving any actual thought to the enormous failures our government would have to suffer for that to happen.

They're essentially unconcerned that for that scenario to play out, the entire Bill of Rights would have to be suspended, along with prohibitions on the military operating on US soil, and a whole host of other things that would have to fail in order for such a confiscation to happen.

What they're focused on isn't the scenario, or whether citizens could successfully fight a military, or anything else.

Rather, they're engaging in a form of public masturbation.

On a visceral level, these people *hate* gun owners. They see gun owners as an impediment to the ability to create a better world.

As a result, they want nothing more than to see gun owners killed.

On top of that, most of the people who make the argument that gun owners can't stand up to the military also hail from the same political viewpoint that has an ardent hatred for the military as well, seeing them as the embodiment of America's crass imperialistic designs.

From where I sit, the people who make this argument don't make it out of any actual practical sense, but engage in it because, frankly, they hate the military and they hate gun owners, and (being too cowardly to take direct action themselves) they would like nothing better than to pit two groups of people they hate against one another.

<TITLE> Not happy with Kirkland Brand Omega 3 Fish Oil </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-25 01:03:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So since getting interested in supplements, I've been supplementing with Kirkland Brand Fish Oil. The label says the capsules are 1,000mg each.

However, when looking at the nutrition label, it says that each tablet only contains 250 mg of EPA and DHA, and 50 mg of "Other Omega-3 fatty acids."

Examine.com references 250 mg as the minimum dose, and 6 g as being optimal for combatting muscle soreness, etc.

My plan was to kind of hit somewhere in the middle, and get a daily dose of 3 g, but frankly, the idea of swallowing upwards of 12 capsules (in addition to my other supplements) just holds no appeal.

Is there a better brand of fish oil that has a higher amount of EPA/DHA that anyone recommends?

Thanks. </TEXT>

As a political issue, gun control has been shown to be a consistent loser for the democratic party, and the most ardent prohibitionists have been forced to moderate their tone and stridency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say the you're the one with a problem of understanding how the world works. 

Murder and drunk driving both represent actions that in and of themselves are harmful to others.

Gun control laws, on the other hand, tend to treat all people exactly the same, regardless of whether they're a career criminal with a history of violence or an athlete competing in a shooting sport. 

While no one advocates for allowing criminals unfettered  access to guns, you have to be daft to support the kinds of gun control laws that would result in prison time simply because someone puts an adjustable stock on a target rifle or chooses to own a magazine that holds more than an arbitrarily-designated number of rounds.  

In short, the law can only punish people after an act has been committed, which is why laws punishing a murderer are good, and laws punishing someone who hasn't victimised anyone, but owns something you think is scary, are idiotic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would agree. Most of the reporters there probably aren't even aware of their bias, but you really only have to see how they portray organizations like the NRA and compare that to how they portray gun control groups. 

You can also see it in what they choose to cover. 

For example, here's a story they posted about the father of the Santa Barbara rampage killer meeting with the father who gave a speech in favor of gun control after the rampage. 

http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/06/16/322592320/photos-father-of-santa-barbara-killer-meets-victims-dad

Take note of the context, though. 

They didn't do any actual reporting because no NPR reporter was actually present, and the photographs were provided by a communications firm that works with anti-gun advocacy groups. 

Given the context, it's clear that the story isn't a news report in the slightest, but rather the regurgitation of a press release accompanied by some emotionally loaded photos.

<TEXT> This is the first article NPR head posted that's even somewhat pro-rights in about a year. 

Every other story on guns they post is just yet more drum beating demonizing gun owners and spreading misinformation. 

So either this one somehow managed to sneak through, or it's the rare story they post as top cover so they can claim that they're an impartial news source.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gun buy-ups aren't about effective crime reduction.

From a left-wing perspective there are two advantages to this. 

1.) Good feels and lots of back-patting.
2.) When the buy-up policy ultimately doesn't work, it allows them to claim that the failure was the result of not "going far enough." They can then campaign for stronger gun control laws. 

This is a common theme on the left. Failure of their policies is always going to lead to calls for ever stronger policies which will inevitable fail just as badly, leading to yet more calls for stronger policies, wash, rinse, repeat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've started taking a combination of supplements and vitamins, and instead of trying to keep track of everything in my head, I'm thinking about creating a spreadsheet of some sort to keep track of my supplement use, dosages, times, and any perceived effects.

Does anyone have any tips, or even a template on how to go about doing this?

<TEXT> I had the same attitude, and only recently began supplementing after doing quite a bit of research on examine.com.

I've been using creatine for about a month now, along with some targeted use of vitamins and minerals (D3, zinc, magnesium, krill oil) and have noticed gains in my ability to complete WODs.

The difference isn't something massive, but I find that in really hard WODs where I have to really dig deep to finish, there's actually something at the bottom to use. 

Frankly, I wish I had started supplementing years ago.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Newbie looking for Creatine Supplement Recomendations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-30 04:11:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've just started to try a Creatine supplement for my workout. I bought the Body Fortress brand, which claims to have a whole bunch of stuff in it other than Creatine.

Here's a link to the nutrition label:
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/815qNfV4toL._SL1500_.jpg

I've noticed some positive results, but since picking this stuff up, I'm wondering if it's the right choice, or if I would be better off supplementing with just plain creatine.

I'm completely new to this game, and a lot of the supplement marketing and advertising strikes me as being about as trustworthy as the average used car salesman.

So am I good sticking with the Body Fortress stuff, or should I be looking at something else?

Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Roku Android App </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-07 07:27:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been messing around with the Roku Android app for smart phones for the last few days, and have to say, I'm impressed with some of it and disappointed by other parts.

**The Good**

It works really well. Reaction time actually seems to be faster than the Roku remote.

The app has a neat feature that allows you to view pictures or videos taken with your phone on your TV.

The app lets you stream music on your phone to the TV.

It's free!

**The Bad**

I can't use my phone's keyboard to run a search. To my thinking, this is the biggest and worst limitation of the app. It's ridiculous that I can't use my phone's keyboard to type in a title/director/etc. to run a search, rather having to peck the characters in one-by-one just like with the stock remote.

**The ugly**

When streaming video from my phone to the Roku, the app appears to compress the video quite heavily resulting in a lot of artifacting. This isn't too big of a deal if you're just wanting to show some videos to friends family.

Ocassionally the video will stop to buffer.


Overall, the app is a lot like the Roku itself, in that it does some things very well, but the interface isn't the best and sometimes it goes a bit wonky. That said, I think it's worth installing. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Rough Proposal For Colorado Legislators </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-12 03:48:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that Morse and Giron have been recalled, the Colorado Democratic party is probably in momentary internal chaos.

If the Republicans really want to win points, now is the time for them to push through pro-rights legislation, and, frankly, I think they ought to put forth the following proposals:

1.) A repeal of the magazine ban in full.
2.) Repeal the universal background check law, as well as the requirements for background checks to be conducted at gun shows.
3.) Tax incentives designed to bring gun and gun-related companies to the state of Colorado in order to generate jobs and tax revenue, as well as establishing a group of businesses in Colorado with a vested interest in ensuring that gun control cannot get a foot hold in this state. (Magpul was invaluable in their actions to help to reduce the damage of these laws.)
4.) Other proposals that would just simply cause the Democrats to flip out. Not sure what those would be. Maybe legalize hunting with sound suppressors, paying for maintenance and range safety officers at public ranges, or something else I haven't thought of.

Right now the Democrats fundamentally believe that Morse and Giron were recalled because of their stance on guns. It's time for the Republicans to step up, propose some pro-gun laws, and force the rest of the state Democratic party to either back the Republican play or face the consequences. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Request: Blog Post Comparing Record Number of Background Checks to Claims that Gun Ownership Rates are in Decline </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-02 14:21:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Several months ago, I randomly stumbled across a blog post where the author tackled the media claims that gun ownership was falling, while at the same time pointing out that the number of NICS checks conducted were at record highs.

The article basically showed that while the percentage of households that owned guns was smaller compared to years past, this was due to the fact that the rate of gun owning households growing at a slower rate than the rate of household growth overall.

The upshot of the article was that, even though fewer households have a gun as an overall percentage in years past, there are still record numbers of gun owners overall.

It was a very insightful analysis, and now, for the life of me, I can't find it again. If anyone else remembers what I'm talking about, or could dig it up for me, I'd be truly grateful.

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Colorado Universal Background Check Law HB-1229, Discriminates Against Gays. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-22 17:13:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I've just been reading through the proposed universal background check law here in Colorado.

The law outlines a number of exceptions where a transfer can be legally done without having to go through a background check.

Here's the list of exempted transfers straight from the bill:

[QUOTE]3 (b)  EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY SECTION 18-12-111, A TRANSFER
4 THAT IS A BONA FIDE GIFT BETWEEN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, WHICH
5 ARE LIMITED TO SPOUSES, PARENTS, CHILDREN, SIBLINGS, GRANDPARENTS,
6 AND GRANDCHILDREN;[/QUOTE]

So, reading through that list of exemptions, it would be legal for me to transfer a gun to my wife for self protection while I'm out of town on a business trip.

However, if a gay man or lesbian were to transfer a gun to his/her partner under the exact same set of circumstances, it would be an illegal transfer without conducting a background check.

Given that the Democratic party has consistently positioned itself as the champion of LGBT issues, I find it highly instructive that they're willing to draw a line of demarcation that essentially says "gay people don't have the same gun right to self defense as straight people."

No matter where you stand on LGBT political issues, no reasonable person would think that such unequal treatment under the law could possibly be fair or just, and regardless of where you personally stand on this issue, the Colorado Democratic party should be called to account for their clearly discriminatory attitude regarding gays and guns.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I recently smoked a fairly massive pork loin at a friend's house. This thing is perfectly done. Smokey, tender, and delicious.

I would happily just eat the thing by cutting hunks of it off with a knife, but that somehow doesn't seem civilized, especially since this enormous hunk of delicious meat is going to be my work day lunch for the next week or two.

So, hit me with your best suggestions for fancying this up. I'm already thinking in terms of doing some pulled pork, but also would like ideas about making pork medallions with some kind of paleo sauce.

Or any other suggestions you guys might have. Wrap it in bacon and garnish with an avocado? Served with a side of shrimp and slathered in a coconut and red pepper sauce? Something else I haven't even thought of?

Lay it on me! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Virginia Tech Review Panel's Assessment of Magazine Bans </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-27 17:44:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, I've been going back and doing some reading on previous spree shootings. One of the documents I'm working my way through is the Virginia Tech Review Panel's Report on the Mass Shootings at Virginia Tech. (You can download the report here:
http://www.governor.virginia.gov/tempcontent/techpanelreport.cfm )


The report is quite comprehensive, covering a history of Seung Hui Cho, his mental problems, Virginia Tech's security protocols at the time of the shooting, a timeline of the shooting, and how Cho acquired his guns.


As you might recall, Cho committed his crimes with a Glock 19 and a Walther P22. He purchased and subsequently used numerous magazines for both guns, including several 15-round magazines for the Glock 19.


On page 87 of the PDF I came across the following bombshell:



The panel also considered whether the previous federal Assault Weapons Act of 1994 that banned 15-round magazines would have made a difference inthe April 16 incidents. The law lapsed after 10 years, in October 2004, and had banned clips or magazines with over 10 rounds. ***The panel concluded that 10-round magazines that were legal would have not made much difference in the incident.*** Even pistols with rapid loaders *(ed. I think they are referring to revolver speed loaders here)* could have been about as deadly in this situation.



So there it is.


In an official 260 page review conducted jointly between the Virginia Governor's office and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the official stance is that a magazine ban would have made little to no difference in the outcome of the shooting. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In Defense of High Capacity Magazines </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-23 21:17:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting, there have been calls for reinstating a federal ban on magazines that hold more than ten rounds.

Arguing for the right to own these magazines is something that can be problematic, as even many gun owners see no issue with restricting access to them.

Furthermore, I've seen a lot of pro-gun folks try to make a case for these magazines, and come off as either insensitive, buffoonish, or just downright stupid, and it makes me cringe every time I watch it happen.

So, in the interest of preserving our second amendment rights, here are my thoughts on arguing against bans on 10 round magazines.

**Know Who You're Debating**

Most of the people reacting to Sandy Hook (and other rampage shootings) are not gun people. For the most part, they aren't anti-gun people, either. They are, however, completely ignorant about guns and how they work, and have a general level of fear associated with guns and people who own them.

What they're looking for is an answer to the question of "how do we stop rampage shootings" and they're grabbing at the first straw, gun control, that seems like a good idea. You have to convince them that gun control is not the answer.

**Arguments That Don't Work, and Why**

* It's my right to own them because 2nd Amendment.*
-This argument is true, however it makes you look stupid and selfish. After all, to the people you're speaking to, you come off sounding like you put your right to own a dangerous product above the safety of their kids.

*I own them because I can.*
-Again, this is a stupidly weak argument, and a tautology on top.

*I own them because I may need them for self-defense.*
-Remember, the people you're talking to have not spent any time at all studying personal defense, much less defense with a firearm. By and large, most people assume that a more traditional style of gun, like a revolver, would be perfectly adequate. Furthermore, statistically speaking, for the vast, vast majority of defensive encounters, they're right. The number of self-defense incidents where capacity of the defender's gun was what won the day are, in truth,  vanishingly small. As a result, most people, who've spent no time reading up on the current state of self-defense will dismiss you as a paranoid lunatic with delusions of having to fend off an army.

*I own them because we may need them in case of invasion/the US government turns on its own people/The Revolution/Wolverines!*
-Most people in this country live comfortable lives, and they rarely pay attention to historical precedent. As a result, they don't believe that things could come down to a situation where things go all Warsaw Ghetto, and even if they *do* entertain the notion that such a thing could happen here, they cannot and will not consider the idea of actually picking up a gun and fighting against an existential threat. Any argument that follows the revolutionary line of reasoning will be dismissed out of hand as paranoid fantasizing. You will be painted as a lunatic preparing for an event that will never happen. The assumption is that you're so delusional that you are putting your right to a revolution that will never come up against the protection of children.

*I own them because it makes it easier for me at the shooting range or because having them reduces amount of time I have to waste loading magazines.*
-Again, this argument makes you look completely unsympathetic. After all, if a ban on magazines would reduce these shootings, then who cares if it means you're slightly inconvenienced during a range trip?

*I own them because I compete in USPSA/3 Gun/some other form of competition.*
-This argument can help to counter the "you don't need a high capacity magazine to hunt" or "why would anyone have these things?" and pointing out that you're involved in a competitive sport may confer some legitimacy, but it's still a weak argument, because you sound like you're putting the enjoyment of a game above the safety of kids.

**Arguments That Should Work, With Explanation**

The best way to voice your opposition to a magazine ban isn't by asserting your rights. Regardless of how strongly you feel about the 2nd Amendment, rights-based or possession-based arguments are not going to sway someone who is on the fence about the 2nd Amendment, and/or already believes that no reasonable person owns such an item.

The best way to make the case in favor of 10 round magazines is from a policy perspective. As gun owners we should all be actively engaging in the public discussion over these items, and offering our unique knowledge to help guide policy in a direction that will actually be effective at stopping these sorts of shootings from happening in the future.

***The best arguments against a ban on these magazines is to point out that such a ban SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK.*** It's thoroughly terrible policy that will absolutely not stop the next rampage killer from taking out as many victims as his tortured mental state demands.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments that are bound to be the most effective, at least with people who aren't being completely emotional about the situation.

*The 1994-2004 Assault Weapon Ban*
-The US had a ban on these magazines that lasted for ten years, and during that time, there was not one trustworthy study that showed the ban had any effect whatsoever on rates of violent crime, regardless of the type.

*The technology is already "in the wild."*
-With the exception of the ten years during the federal assault weapon ban 10 round magazines have been sold with hundreds of millions of new guns, and available on the market to anyone who cares to purchase them. These magazines are mechanically simple (about as complex as a well-constructed travel mug), small, and completely untraceable. Any attempt to regulate these magazines will essentially be DOA because there are already so many of them in private hands.

*Consider the implications of enforcing a ban*
-Everyone wants to get behind the idea of a ban without putting any thought into actual enforcement costs. Ask them to explain how they would enforce a ban.
Would they be willing to ok warrantless searches to find these magazines?
Would they be willing to arrest, try, convict, and imprison for ten years anyone found to possess one?
How much would it cost to imprison all of these millions of people?
Would we have to construct new prisons for them?
Would it really be worth it?

(The nice thing about this line of reasoning is that it's an extremely easy litmus test to see if you're dealing with someone who's halfway rational or not. No rational person would actually agree that locking up tens of millions of people who've harmed no one would be a good idea. And if the person says they're ok with it, you know they're a nut. This argument also has the potential to work well if you're talking to people in favor of legalizing pot, as the comparisons between marijuana users and magazine owners are actually pretty clear-cut.)

*How to enforce a ban?*
-How would you keep people from importing unmarked magazines from outside of the US, or squirting them out of a 3D printer?

*Point out that other mass shootings have taken place without 10 round magazines*
-3 of the 4 guns used by the Columbine shooters did not use high capacity magazines. Specifically, Eric Harris had to reload his Hi-Point Carbine ten times, and the double-barreled shotgun used was reloaded over twenty times. [Source]http://acolumbinesite.com/weapon.html The Walther used by Seung-Hui Cho could not hold more than ten rounds. The Beltway "snipers" never fired more than one shot at any given murder attempt. Charles Whitman used no high capacity magazines.

-Changing magazines is an action that even an amateur can easily complete in under four seconds. Even if the killer is limited to ten round magazines, it won't matter. They will simply carry more magazines and reload more often. Furthermore, there is not one instance where that extra reload time made a difference in the outcome of a shooting. (Some may try to claim that it did in the case of the Giffords shooting, but Loughner's gun jammed, which is what provided the time to others around him to react.)


Finally, if you're a parent and a gun owner, voice this fact. Having a kid means you've got skin in the game, and gives you additional legitimacy. Remember, at the end of the day, everyone wants the same thing: to stop or reduce the number of rampage killings, especially those targeting children. As gun owners, we have not only a unique perspective and specialist knowledge on the subject, but we've also got the most to lose. Therefore it is extremely important for all of us to present the best arguments we can.

I hope that this post is useful. I've been making a number of these arguments on public news forums with some success. I'd appreciate any feedback.

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, awhile back, I installed an App on my Kindle Fire called [Peekaboo Barn](http://www.nightanddaystudios.com/app/peekaboo-barn).

My kid goes nuts for this thing, and this got me to wondering if there were other decent apps out there that an infant would like, or would help them to learn something new.

Thanks. </TEXT>
