<TEXT> Nope:

 Microsoft sold 8.4 million Lumia phones in Q4 (compared to 5.8 million last year), but revenue dropped 38 percent to $748 million.

 The net loss in Q4 amounted to $3.2 billion, which Bloomberg reports is its biggest loss ever. 

The writedown was most likely done now to *hide* that there were other losses as well, especially when people like you keep hand-waving and saying "oh, it's just the Nokia writedown, nothing to see here".

My guess is that's exactly the reaction Microsoft counted on, to hide their *other* $1 billion losses this quarter. 

Just to be clear **only the $2.1 billion were from the writedown**, not the rest to 3.2 billion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well no. If Microsoft had a $8 billion write off then the stock price *should* become lower and account for that failure, just like when Microsoft bought Nokia the stock price likely increased due to the optimism that Microsoft might start to do well in mobile. That didn't happen, so the price needs to come down now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Current spec, which will probably change:

https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/Argon-v2.pdf

From page 4:

 Our solutions. We offer two new hashing scheme called Argon and Argon2. Argon is our original
submission to PHC. It is a multipurpose hash function, that is optimized for highest resilience against
tradeoff attacks, so that any, even small memory reduction would lead to significant time and computational
penalties. Argon can be used for password hashing, key derivation, or any other memory-hard
computation (e.g., for **cryptocurrencies**).

 Argon2 summarizes the state of the art in the design of memory-hard functions. It is a streamlined
and simple design. It aims at the highest memory filling rate and effective use of multiple computing
units, while still providing defense against tradeoff attacks. Argon2 is optimized for the x86 architecture
and exploits the cache and memory organization of the recent Intel and AMD processors. Argon2 has
two variants: Argon2d and Argon2i. Argon2d is faster and uses data-depending memory access, which
makes it suitable for cryptocurrencies and applications with no threats from side-channel timing attacks.
Argon2i uses data-independent memory access, which is preferred for password hashing and passwordbased
key derivation. Argon2i is slower as it makes more passes over the memory to protect from tradeoff
attacks.

 We recommend Argon for the applications that aim for the highest tradeoff resilience and want
to guarantee prohibitive time and computational penalties on any memory-reducing implementation.
According to our cryptanalytic algorithms, an attempt to use half of the requested memory (for instance,
64 MB instead of 128 MB) results in the speed penalty factor of 140 and in the penalty 218. The penalty
grows exponentially as the available memory decreases, which effectively prohibits the adversary to use
any smaller amount of memory. Such high computational penalties are a unique feature of Argon.
We recommend Argon2 for the applications that aim for high performance. Both versions of Argon2
allow to fill 1 GB of RAM in a fraction of second, and smaller amounts even faster. It scales easily to
the arbitrary number of parallel computing units. Its design is also optimized for clarity to ease analysis
and implementation.

EDIT: Another interesting tidbit:

 Argon2 is heavily optimized for the x86 architecture, so that implementing it
on dedicated cracking hardware should be neither cheaper nor faster. Even
specialized ASICs would require significant area and would not allow reduction
in the time-area product.

It's also resistant to GPUs. </TEXT>

They just don't see it as a *major* improvement over the current fission reactors, and the current fission reactors are a "known", and most people tend to go with what they know - *unless* the alternative offers a radical improvement, such as fusion reactors would, and be even safer than thorium fission reactors.

Plus, energy from solar and wind is already *half* the price of *new* nuclear reactors. So there isn't much interest to build new fission nuclear reactors right now anyway (nor should it be - at least 80% of the world's electricity should be provided by wind/solar/batteries). </TEXT>

That would be $20 for it, so it shouldn't cost them more than $50 from the retail price. That also means if a phone comes with 64GB default, they shouldn't charge you $100 more for 128GB, but only $50. </TEXT>

False flag cyber attacks kind of seem like a step down from that, if they're going to risk giving people with mental issues access to bombs so they can say they caught another terrorist later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Work taxes should be cut first before VAT anyway. The VAT was already cut by a whopping 15% for food and 2 months later the average price drop for food items is around 6%, and only about a third of the food items had a price drop at all. Most companies preferred to book the difference.

People would've felt the reduction in tax cuts much better if they dropped 10% from work taxes than 15% from food VAT (and the promised 6% cut for the general VAT). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bullshit. Faster at what? Benchmarks have shown the difference to be negligible. 

The only *possible* thing it's faster at is boot time - but even that is mostly misleading, because Microsoft is counting boot time to the lockscreen (or whatever that is called), but it takes another 2 minutes or so to load the actual Windows files after that. </TEXT>

Not surprising considering that even for an IE update you have to restart your PC. Microsoft still requires a lot of dumb Windows reboots for trivial upgrades.

If Microsoft is going to force the upgrades on users, while the upgrades still require reboots every few days (while you're working on something), people are just going to rate using Windows as a poor experience, and stop buying Windows machines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are not bad. The biggest thing I'd worry about is backdoors, but at least the software will be built by Google and the hardware heavily scrutinized during the development process. So I'd trust *this* Huawei device, but others not as much (also applies to Xiaomi, and even more so to random Chinese device makers).

Whether it's $450 or $600, I really hope Google will put an S6/G4-level camera in there (or better). That's really the main compromise with Nexus devices and it's quite a frustrating one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but by a much smaller margin (11%), which wouldn't be that surprising because it's a brand new clean browser. It would be surprising if such a browser came out and *wasn't* 10% faster than Chrome or Firefox. In 6 months the Chrome guys might do their best to beat Edge by 10%, too, so again it's not that big of a deal.

That's why the 112% Sunspider benchmark is so misleading. Chrome has given up benchmarking for it because it's a useless benchmark since 2012. Is Microsoft really going to pile on Sunspider until the year 2020? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ethereum - too hard a word for the global market? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll probably get downvoted or have the post deleted for even asking this now, but I think it's an important question to ask.

"Bitcoin" is relatively easy to memorize and talk about for most people. But I feel that "Ethereum" is too strange of a word to use "in the future" in daily conversations (assuming Ethereum will ever be that successful that everyone will use it in one way or another).

Forget Americans for a moment. What about foreigners? How easy or "normal" do they find talking about Ethereum?

I just fear that the word itself will be a sort of "invisible break" on the adoption of Ethereum in the future. It could make the adoption significantly slower and perhaps even put a hard cap on it. 

Do you really see the word "Ethereum" become as popular and used as the word "Internet" in 20 years? Maybe it will be, but it doesn't feel like it could ever reach that level, because it seems like a much harder and "weird" word to say and write. With Bitcoin or say Zerocash or Bitshares I could see happen, but not with Ethereum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a Moore's Law for batteries - about 8% improvement per year, which means prices drop in half/density doubles every 10 years. But lately that pace has been accelerating a bit thanks to the rise of electric cars, which have accelerated the economies of scale, and therefore prices have dropped more aggresively. Tesla says batteries prices will drop by 40% in 5 years, thanks to their Gigafactory.

I fully expect price per KWh to drop from the current $300 or so to $100 within 10 years, at which point a good portion of the population (especially in richer countries) will find electric cars (with reasonable ranges) appealing. If we can drop it to under $50/KWh (probably not with Li-Ion batteries though) in 10 years after that, that's when electric cars should start appealing to just about everyone. I thin *most* people will want an electric car with a 100-150 KWh battery. But *many* people (as much as 30% of the drivers) will probably be content with 50-100 KWh batteries, too (200-400 mile ranges for in-city driving).

There IS a Moore's Law for solar, too. Haven't you been paying attention? Solar panel prices have dropped about 50% every 5 years, if I'm not mistaken, in the past period.

You're thinking about it wrong. Like you're expecting the solar-to-electricity efficiency to double every 5 years or something. Kind of like you would've expected the CPUs to double in GHz every 2 years about 2 decades ago. But that wasn't the relevant point, but that the number of transistors would double for the same price, or the price of the same number of transistors would cost half as much.

The same thing is happening in solar. Manufacturing *efficiency* is what makes the prices halven every 5 years or whatever. So yeah, there absolutely is a Moore's Law for solar, too. What matters is not necessarily that solar efficiency goes to 80%, but that prices for solar panels drop from $1/Wh (or whatever it is now) to $0.1/Wh, or even lower than that. *That* is what will cause an explosion in adoption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if they'd stopped, we'd never know since they merged the PC and Mobile groups together.

My guess is they *haven't* stopped, because now they are selling $107-$161 Atom chips as "Celerons" and "Pentiums" in the PC market, which allows them to even give away the *mobile* targeted chips for free if they want.

In my opinion that's quite anti-competitive because for instance they could push Snapdragon 820-competitors into $100 phones, where other ARM makers would have no chance to compete and push them out of the market until they are dead, and then raise prices.

They did that already with the Zenfone 2 where they pushed a 810-level chip (or close to it) into a mid-range $300 device which would normally get something like a Snapdragon 615, and people were "impressed" by what powerful Atom chips can be in a mid-range device - when in fact this was *only* possible because of Intel's heavy (and unfair) subsidies.

You may say, but what's wrong with that as long as I benefit? Well you don't, or at least you won't, because Intel will eventually cut the subsidies, and then because people "want Intel" (like it happened with the heavily subsidized Haswell Celeron Chromebooks) Intel will spike the price and OEMs will have no choice but to continue using those chips.

It's also what they did in Chromebooks. Now people would rather pay $100 for an Atom "Celeron" chip inside a Chromebook than get a $30 Tegra X1 Chromebook, even though there would be no difference architecture support-wise (it's a web browser OS after all) and the performance of the X1 is likely to be much higher, too. - but the "we want Intel" mob mentality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Giving the fingerprint data to a 3rd party or even a 2nd party's servers is *never* acceptable.

Plus, there now ways to use a fingerprint to authenticate to a third party site, too. Check out Microsoft's Passport technology, which will also be part of FIDO 2.0. It will authenticate [locally](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-passport-passwordless-login,28767.html), and then create a public key to authenticate you to another site (or something along those lines). Your fingerprint data will never have to leave the device to log you to other sites.


So we only have to wait a year or so until we get that. There's no need to risk our fingerprints to someone else's servers right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since we're on the crazy speculation train, here's one for you.

"Anonymous" could be anyone, including the FBI. In fact the last time "Anonymous" was a strong group and did all of those "operations", one of their main guys, who had a role in *coordinating* the attacks, was an [FBI mole](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/hacker-sabu-defends-informing-anonymous-fbi-interview).

So what if it's the FBI that hacked the NYSE, in the same day that the chief of FBI was doing a [Senate hearing](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/08/fbi-doj-name-new-enemy-crypto-wars-apple-google/) on encryption backdoors and trying to tell the world how we're all doomed if they don't get their backdoors?

Too crazy for the FBI to be trying to do a false flag operation like that just to get the US population to support encryption backdoors (their holy grail apparently), especially when they seem pretty desperate that the House is against their proposals (seen in the last 2 House hearings)?! 

Would that be  more or less crazy than FBI ["assisting"](http://fair.org/home/zero-for-40-at-predicting-attacks-why-do-media-still-take-fbi-terror-warnings-seriously/) dozens of [terrorist plots](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book) on U.S. soil?

Or it could be only a technical error, like the NYSE has [already said](https://www.nyse.com/market-status/history). </TEXT>

And I bet in 2-3 years they'll write off the $8 billion Skype acquisition, too, because there's no way they will recover that money by the half of the 21st century. Unless they're counting all [DoD contracts](http://www.geekwire.com/2013/score-microsoft-defense-department-windows/) as [ROI](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/nsa_offers_billions_for_skype_pwnage/) for the [Skype business](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2220079/microsoft-subnet/microsoft-patent-may-ruin-skype--may-make-voip-spy-and-pry-easy-for-gov-t.html). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But this slow, calculated approach to releasing Windows 10 can only be a good thing. It shows a lot of foresight and careful planning,

Oh what a load of crap. This is because Windows 10 couldn't be finished on time. So they decided to release it only to a small group first to make sure their unfinished Windows 10 doesn't brick too many people's PCs.

/r/Microsoft seems to be a bigger circlejerk than /r/androidcirclejerk - and the latter is ironic.  </TEXT>

A bit optimistic don't you know? Like by about an order of magnitude or two?

Mi se pare stupid sa vii dupa 100 de ani sa "ceri pamantul inapoi" sau chestii de genul. Pe urma acestor lucruri se pornesc multe razoaie, care ar fi putut fi completat evitate daca nu ar exista lacomia (pentru resurse...ceea ce nu e cazul aici) si simtul asta de "reunificare".

Si nici nu mai vorbesc de faptul ca o reunificare cu Republica Molvoda ne-ar saraci pe toti, pentru ca Romania ar trebui sa dea lor si celor de acolo pentru pensii, scoli, drumuri si toate cele, la fel de multi cum se da si aici. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What about using Microsoft's Passport tech (which apparently is being standardized for FIDO 2.0), which authenticates the user locally, and then authenticates him with a service, without that service getting any real information, like his password or whatever:

Also, I'd prefer fingerprint recognition to facial recognition. Much harder to spoof since you don't have your fingerprints all over the web, unlike your face. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed. Denver would've been more interesting for emulating games with its significantly higher single-threaded performance, but it seems Nvidia has just scrapped it due to its poor choky multi-tasking performance. 

I think Nvidia should try again to make its own core, but this time forego the in-order "software-based" design and instead do a regular 7-way out-out-order core with a low clock speed and on whatever  smallest process node is out there (Nvidia keeps using older process nodes in their chips when they launch them, which is unfortunate).

Even continuing to use ARM's cores (A72) with its own GPU, but using the latest node and without exaggerating with the CPU's clock speed, Nvidia could still show a nice chip for mobile. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hybrids will be about as successful as "hybrid PCs" - jack of all trades, master of none (yet still expensive).

Hybrids can't focus on maximum battery efficiency because they have to hold a whole other system in there (gas-powered one). Plus, you still have to do all the same maintenance as you do for a regular car. If you don't want a tiny battery (which is what all hybrids have) then it will cost you much more to buy and own a hybrid than a full EV in the same range. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously there are some real transition pains to consider, but I believe ultimately they are a small price to pay when a country's institutions can use its own open source distro along with open source software and taxpayers money are used in an open way instead of filling American corporations' pockets by paying for software which could even be backdoored.

But other than that, I also believe Microsoft is a big obstacle in countries adopting Linux, both directly (heavy lobbying against it), but also indirectly (not giving OEMs a choice but to use Windows in most markets, and even if they want to use an open source solution, Microsoft might ask them to pay a fee anyway - patents, etc). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, and Model 3 should have at least 200 miles, too, although I think initial rumors put it at 250 miles, but that may not be accurate.

Also, I think Tesla's official numbers may be more accurate, kind of how Apple's battery life numbers are (or at least were in Steve Jobs' days, now I think Tim Cook has started exaggerating a bit, or at least mentions the light usage as if it were moderate usage) more accurate than most laptop manufacturers' numbers, which tended to claim battery life numbers that were about 2x what you'd get in the real world (remember those 8h battery life claims with 6-cells in 2009 or so? Never true).

For instance, I saw a recent review of the Renault ZOE, and they said it has a 130 mile range, yet the reviewer put it more at like 80 miles (~130 KM, which is about 40% less).

So unless proven otherwise, I'd much rather trust Tesla's "200 mile range" claims than other car manufacturers' "200 mile range" claims. 

Also, although not a foolproof way to verifty, checking the battery size should give a good idea of the range, too. For instance if Tesla will use a 60 kWh battery to achieve that 200 mile range claim, but VW will use a 40 kWh one, then it will be a lot more clear who's telling the truth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well no. The CAFC ruled that APIs can be copyrighted. The Supreme Court stayed the ruling.

HOWEVER, Google's case *per se* was sent to a lower Court to see if Google's "violation" was actually covered under fair use. But even if Google wins that one, APIs still remain copyrightable as per the last CAFC ruling.

tl;dr Google still has a chance to win the case, but the software industry is *already* screwed (unless the 9th Circuit Court overturns the CAFC ruling, but seems unlikely). </TEXT>

<TEXT> My problem with it is that it claims to be one of the most secure apps, yet it doesn't even provide end-to-end encryption by default. It leaves it to the user to enable it. Therefore for 99% of people or cases, it not's a privacy/security tool. It's just like any other IM app with HTTPS encryption. </TEXT>

Oh, and the NSA, or Russia, or China, or your local drug cartel could probably hack into your self-driving car and kill you while you drive 80mph on the highway.

Fun times ahead! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Which is great. But make it fully opt-in so users who "want that potential" can choose to enable it. Don't enable it for all unaware users.

It doesn't matter if it's "just an algorithm". That data will be stored on Google's servers so either hackers or abusive governments around the world can get that data.

You know how the OPM hacked happened? That could happen to Google, too (and in fact it *has happened* - [NSA hacked Google](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24751821)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, but "Google Now on tap" will still be able to see all the data within all Android apps on M, *unless* developers "opt-out" of that. 

I believe they are able to do that by *reading what's on the screen* in those apps (or perhaps in RAM), therefore bypassing any transport encryption that app may have. 

I think it's a very unfortunate thing for Google to do, especially when the default is *opt-out*, which probably means 90% of the developers won't even be aware this exists, let alone knowing how to disable it to protect their users' privacy.

<TEXT> The new clock icon is by far the most annoying. So tiny compared to the rest.

By the way, I agree that iOS does it better and it looks much more elegant to have them *look* the same size, but the way iOS does that is by having a "background" of the same size for all icons. 

Check the Chrome icon in that example. It has a background on it, which makes it *look* the same size as all the other icons, but it's not.

Personally, I wish Google adopted the same idea, too, because Android icons look "too messy". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish Google would also allow users to create a "new account", like you can do now in Lollipop, but one that is completely isolated from your normal account and has "root" privileges. Kind of how Windows has Administrator and Standard accounts. 

Android accounts are by default "Standard" for security purposes - and that's great - but they should allow power users to have extra privileges on their phones, too, without having to resort to exploits in software. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed:

https://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8518681/protests-riots-work

Violent protests, including riots, and then full blown revolutions, are just part of a scale - the scale of "how much you're inconveniencing the government" with the "protest".

It's the *government* that should be listening to peaceful protests - such as let's say Occupy Wallstreet - but they don't, and then leave people no choice, but to "escalate" the protests. And when violence and window breaking starts, it appears to be "sudden", when in fact it's just the people letting out their old frustrations that are bubbling up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or it could be a Mexican drug cartel using Chinese botnets. How do they really know? My guess is that if it *was* a Mexican cartel trying to get info on US government employees that they can blackmail, then the NSA wouldn't say it's them anyway, and would probably still blame it on China. There's nothing to gain for the NSA from saying it's a Mexican cartel that did it. What would they do about that (politically) - start *another* war on drugs?

Either way, it seems the US government is taking absolutely *zero* responsibility for the hack "well, because China...and they have good hackers" - or something.

It would be even worse if say Nigeria or hackers from Moldova got all that info. Because that would make *them* look like the main people to blame for it, as they would look completely incompetent.

Also, Recorded Future and I'm sure other security companies as well, have found that this info is [all over the web](https://www.recordedfuture.com/government-credentials-report/) already. So it really doesn't matter if "China has it" anymore. *Everyone has it* (interested enough to pay for it). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually it takes about 10 years (8% density improvement year over year) to *double* the capacity for the same price (and size).

I really think we're going to see *at least* a quadrupling in density for batteries over the next 10 years. The first doubling is going to come by default as mentioned. The second doubling will come through a combination of Tesla's Gigafactories significantly lowering the price of batteries (so you can add bigger density for the same fixed price) and new "breakthroughs" such as this new manufacturing process, or by switching to solid state batteries, or whatever else will become reality in the next 10 years.

A quadrupling in density would mean even $15,000-$20,000 cars with 300+ mile ranges will become a reality over the next decade. Even if on paper you'd get a $20,000 EV that has the same specifications as a $15,000 gas-powered car (so $5,000 more expensive for the same specs, because of the battery cost), you'd still be better off in the long term because of much less maintenance, much cheaper charging and so on. So even if people intended to buy a $15,000 car, they would still try to buy a $20,000 EV because they'll know it will cost them much less in the long term.

When 300 mile batteries will be only $5,000 of the price of a car, EVs will start replacing cars *at all price levels*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that's not the only thing. It's also Moore's Law. 1440p LCDs displays these days probably use about as much as 1080p LCDs used 2 years ago, too. The problem is when companies like Sony use those  2012 1080p panels to tout energy efficiency.

However, there's also the issue of needing a more powerful GPU. New Adreno GPUs are only like 30% more powerful than last year's high-end generation. Same goes for other GPUs more or less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it's at least a little relevant here, because I know there have been some discussions in the past about whether to enable encryption on Android by default or not. Although I think most here would do it *as long as there's hardware assistance* to make the performance impact negligible. 

Hopefully with Android M and beyond all OEMs will enable encryption by default, as they should all have hardware that support it by then, even at the low-end (Cortex-A53 chips).

Besides the given reasons in the post, there's also that whole other issue of scrambling your data so that when you sell your phone, you don't let others recover your pictures, or Google accounts and so on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that would ruin the "nation-state villain" profile the US government is trying to put in Americans' minds when it comes to hacking.

It's much easier to pass new surveillance laws when "China is attacking us! We NEED THIS!" than "China, but also Russia, and Bulgaria, and South Africa, etc are hacking us...but also tons of random hackers and criminal organizations....and also that's mainly our fault for thinking encryption is literally Hitler so we shouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole and for securing our stuff so poorly because we invest 90% of our "defense" budgets on *offense*...oh, and we're hacking others much more than they do us, too, and we want to give the same powers to the FBI and the US police to hack anyone in the world as well."

I mean that already paints a much more complex and confusing picture about hacking and would make passing laws to give themselves more powers and strip away more of the Americans' rights much more difficult.

So "China is hacking us!" it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree for the same reasons. It's so much easier to "make it" in the US, because the market is almost completely homogeneous, making it "easy" to sell products for millions of dollars, and for the same reason to get investments of millions of dollars in your startup. It's a zillion times harder to do the same "in Europe", because Europe is so fragmented, and English not being an official (at least second) language hinders things as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So? That doesn't explain why the subsidies weren't cut let's say 10 or 20 years later. Subsidies should only be used in the early years of a new technology or industry to give that industry a "boost". Otherwise you could also make the argument that renewable energy should get subsidies for 100 years as well, until we're all using 100% renewable energy (which seems to be the rather weak goal of the G7 countries right now).

Yet, in countries like Germany subsidies for renewables were already cut after about 5 years only, and in the US they are about to go down from 30% to 10% in a year and I think completely gone by 2020.

The problem with leaving subsidies for much longer than 10 years or so is that the industry gets accustomed to that money from the government and doesn't invest in increasing efficiency as much as it should when they are forced by the market to drop prices below a certain price level. Or they simply pocket that difference in profit. 

The oil companies are some of the richest companies on Earth and have been for their entire lifetimes, yet somehow we *still* need to subsidize them - why?! Do you really thin that if their subsidies were cut, they *wouldn't* bring down their prices and cut into their own profits? Of course they would. Because if they keep prices at say $6 per gallon instead of $4, then many more people would be interested in buying an electric car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, probably the best way to drastically increase the security of its systems is for the US government to switch to its own distro of Linux.

And no, I don't just say that because "Linux is more secure than Windows" or whatever, but because the fact that 90% of the world's computers run on the same OS means a TON of people are invested in exploiting it, which means it's not just a top priority for *many* governments to hack it (not just China or Russia, who would focus on breaking the US gov's Linux distro anyway, but others with lower budgets as well) and it's also much easier for them to buy exploits from the black market.

If the US gov alone used say a distro called "Gov-X", it would also be much easier to track those who try to exploit it and hack it. The same thing is futile with Windows hackers, as there are always thousands more waiting in the shadows. </TEXT>

Also, if Uber "wins" we're going to have one mega-corporation owning 50-60% or more not just of a country's "taxis", but of *all* of the world's taxis. That is the opposite of decentralization. Do we really want one company to be the "Google" or Windows of taxis? (in terms of market share). </TEXT>

That article and top comment were only referring to the 14.5% tax on income and touting how then the government would come up short on revenue. But as this article here says, the 14.5% VAT tax would bring twice as much revenue as the 14.5% income tax. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If only they focused on actually mandating strong security and encryption in government agencies instead of trying to pass more surveillance laws.

The NSA is promoting the lie that it can "protect the networks" by acting as an anti-virus. From recent Snowden docs we learned that the NSA was already illegally doing that, yet it didn't stop the OPM hack, and it couldn't have. Security tools like anti-viruses and even firewalls don't work as well anymore. 

What they need to recommend is strong *end-device* security, not strong network security. So when a hacker tries to breach a network, with strong end-device security, he would have to basically hack every single device, rather than the network gateway and then easily get access to thousands of PCs. Google is doing the [same thing](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43231.pdf)(pdf) with its networks now, and it's what everyone should be doing. 

But of course the NSA doesn't want strong end-device security, because that would mean stuff being harder for them to steal as well. So the US government needs to decide once and for all if spying is more important, even if it means getting all of its data stolen as well, or actual security and protecting everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The FBI has been telling us only pedophiles use encryption, so of course we didn't use it..."

 Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House intelligence committee, said last week that Chinese intelligence agencies have for some time been seeking to assemble a database of information about Americans. Those personal details can be **used for blackmail**, or also to shape bogus emails designed to appear legitimate while **injecting spyware** on the networks of government agencies or businesses Chinese hackers are trying to penetrate.

Interesting that he believes all of that. I don't recall him advocating against NSA gathering all of the same information about Americans because of those same reasons. Oh right, the "good guys" would never use that same information for those purposes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The chip is more like ~1.3GHz with Turbo-Boost up to 2.3Ghz. The max speed isn't always activated.

Also, the fact that Intel has to do emulation for many apps means that the chip will perform less well than otherwise, and it will also [consume more power](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/02/arm_test_results_attack_intel/):

 The results weren't pretty: when using binary translation on this CPU-centric benchmark, power consumption went up nearly 90 per cent and performance dipped by over 40 per cent. </TEXT>

I don't think it would be complicated at all. They could probably just open up a special port on Android that only works for ads. Plus, Google owns Admob, which represents lie 75% of the ads on Android apps, so they could "force" the change pretty easily. </TEXT>

It's just that in the winter holiday season, the iPhone manages to get like 5% or so extra market share, and then Android drops to 47-48%, and many Apple-loving tech sites point to that as "Apple growing and Android losing" in the US. But then they fail to write about how the numbers jump back up to over 50% for Android a quarter later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happens all the time too - I mean those connected to the NSA for instance, leaking classified information to the media that makes the NSA or the government *look good*. But somehow nobody is calling for *those* people to be put for "endangering national security" in prison or even assassinated for leaking the data.

I think it's even emerging as some kind of litmus test. Are those in the media trying to discredit the personality of the leaker and call for his assassination or arrest? Then it must be great leak for the population. If not, then the government probably had a hand in it and is trying to manipulate us through that leak. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This also includes things like banning the Disconnect app from the store (anti-tracking protection).

Google can only claim stupidity for so long on such actions. Was it also stupidity or a mistake when they banned ALL adblockers from the store? I don't think so.

They *should* be punished for stuff like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What makes you think he was joking? I'm pretty sure that's exactly the *main* reason for why he wants to kill the Human Rights Act, but he's selling it to the public as something else.

For instance, Cameron and Tories hardly mentioned their surveillance plans during the election, so they got elected for different reasons, but within a week of getting elected passing new surveillance laws seems to be by far the main priority of the party. So why wouldn't you think that's the main reason for killing the HRA too? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's important we at least make it explicitly clear in laws what they can and can not do. The problem is they may be using other programs or have different interpretations, which is why transparency and oversight is also very important. So we need to get more people like Ron Wyden in the Intelligence Committees, and fewer people like Dianne Feinstein, so we can know if they are actually obeying the laws as intended or not.

We also need to *actually cut* NSA's funding by a significant margin (at last half say over the next 3 years). I mean if we're going to stop some of the major "mass surveillance" programs, then they won't need as much budget, right?! Otherwise if we leave them that budget they could just restart the *same* programs under different names and in different locations. Starve the NSA of resources to the point where it *only* has the necessary resources for targeted surveillance. There should also be regular audits (twice a year) of NSA's expenses by the Intelligence Commitee's staff.

So it's not impossible to rein on the NSA. But it does require a lot of political will and some good systems in place to ensure that they *can't* now that they "won't" do some stuff.

We also need to *start punishing people*, even with prison, when they break those laws, which again requires political will, and therefore a lot of activism from us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In regards to privacy there are two disappointing things about Apple:

1) that Apple was "suddenly" added to PRISM after Steve Jobs died. It's still not clear what PRISM exactly is and what kind of cooperation it needs from companies, but it does look that Steve Jobs was opposed to it and Tim Cook agreed to it. It's too much of a coincidence for the NSA to have gotten "PRISM access to Apple" right when Tim Cook became its CEO, even if you believe PRISM is just another NSA hacking program, and didn't require the companies' cooperation.

2) Even worse, Apple agreed to share Mac OS X/iOS zero-days with the DHS/NSA just so the government would start implementing Apple Pay for federal services - I mean what a sell-out! I refuse to believe they did it only because "they care about cybersecurity". Giving the NSA zerodays post-Snowden would mean either Apple is still incredibly naive, or stupid. Of course the NSA would use those Apple bugs offensively now. Seems like such a betrayal of its users. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Calling it an SSD is confusing. It's internal flash. Also devices like the Galaxy S6 are now starting to use the much faster (in write speed especially) UFS 2.0 standard, which microSD cards don't yet support and probably won't support for a while.

Also we may finally see F2FS supported in Android N (maybe even M, but seems unlikely) but that would only work with the internal storage. It most likely won't work with microSD cards if you still want them to work on Windows.

Microsoft will likely still be assholes about it and won't support F2FS in Windows, only so they can rent-seek Android OEMs for billions of dollars a year for the FAT32 patents - Excuse my anger, but it really pisses me off that Microsoft has the nerve to charge royalty just so devices can work with their own OS. Imagine if Google and Samsung charged accessory makers for making accessories that work with Android phones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What in "fake companies" don't you understand?

They weren't legitimate businesses. And if they were essentially "FBI contractors", then I'm okay to having them outed. It's even worse that the FBI hires 3rd parties to spy on people than if they did it themselves, because now you have 3rd parties having access to that information as well. And stingrays can collect conversations from *millions* of people. </TEXT>

A Tegra X2 or something similar would offer Xbox One-like performance and Nintendo could sell it for $150 (obviously subsidized by games, like all the major consoles are). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. Unfortunately, unlike say Google, the carriers have completely immunity for what they give to the NSA (thanks to a law passed around 2005 I think). So they are much more likely to "cooperate" with the NSA, whatever that means - even if it's *against* the law (remember they have immunity...).

So having the carriers keep it really isn't *significantly* better. </TEXT>

Then I would agree. If we're talking about even "truck-sized reactors" like what Lockheed is planning or even bigger than that - then no. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These kind of stories are kind of hit pieces. I mean they aren't really *false*, just disingenuous. Renewables and such technology *should* get subsidies, at least for the first decade or so, and until fossil fuel stops get subsidies, too. 

Until fossil fuels continue to get subsidies you can't say it's "not fair" that renewable stuff gets subsidies. If we're talking what would happen in an *ideal* world is renewables not getting any subsidies, but fossil fuels getting *taxed* extra for the damage they cause to the planet (suffice to say no subsidies either for them). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously we can't know *right now*, since it's not out yet. We'll know for sure when M is out and then we can probably easily check for it against Whatsapp or even TextSecure, and see if Google Now "knows" what you're talking about.

The reason I said "likely" is because Google Now probably reads the data *from the screen*, and last I checked TextSecure or virtually all apps didn't encrypt the data as it's displayed on the screen. If that's how Google does it then it *should* be able to read the data for all apps, regardless of their encrypted at rest or through the network.

Also, as the above comment mentions developers *actually have to opt-out of it* through that flag, which also implies it can read all apps' data. </TEXT>

The issue is that instead of having "decentralized spying" (on each app), they can just hack the one service that "spies" on all the other apps from your phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Still scary that it's essentially *opt-out*. How many Android developers will know to use that? How many users will be aware that the apps they are using don't have that flag enabled?

The developers actually have to be pro-actively aware of the assist API even though their app might have nothing to do with it otherwise, and then know to set that flag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure that has played a big reason, but I think another one was security. SD cards aren't very secure in general. And you also couldn't (really) use them to store apps before, and many OEMs tended to add like 512-2GB of internal storage in their phones in the earlier years, and then add a microSD slot and tell you that you have "up to 32GB of extra storage". Maybe Google was trying to promote bigger amounts of internal storage over the microSD slot cop-out from some OEMs.

Either way, I think they mentioned that for Android M you can "adopt" SD cards as internal storage (probably in a secure way), so we might see Google advocate the use of SD cards again. Who knows, the next Nexus devices might even feature SD card slots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really don't understand why Google imposed the 16MP cap. Just because *most* high-end phones are capped at that right now? So what? Camera resolution increases like every year at the high-end. Will they announce a 20MP bump next year? Why not just do it now? Or just say "full resolution" and be done with it. It's just a weird decision considering it would've probably had a *minor* impact on Google's storage load, but it would've been so great if people didn't have to think about that limitation.

It's also disappointing they can't store raw. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The machine can kill many more and it's tireless.

It's the same argument of targeted spying vs mass automated spying.

By the way, mass automated spying is very ineffective at catching terrorists, because there are [too many false positives](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/03/why_data_mining_wont.html) - just like there would be with automated killing machines. Except in their cases, "false positives" means killing orders of magnitude more innocents than guilty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not very clear at all. Google is being super cryptic about *how it actually works*.

Even the "it creates a virtual card number" thing may not be *exactly* like Apple's, because Google Wallet used to create "virtual numbers" too. But there's no way to know because there are no real details on it. Google is being very annoying, both with the keynote and even more so with this blog post, where this sort of details should exist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're thinking of it from the perspective of them always doing everything right and *just this one time* making this "mistake" which seems dumb and shouldn't have happened.

Except that's not how it works. It's more like they almost *always* gather evidence through less than legal means and then either do or don't use parallel construction before they present it in Court, depending on whether they think the judge will catch on or not. 

From that perspective, and if they have say a 95% success rate in doing that, it doesn't seem quite as dumb, because the reward/risk ratio is very high. Plus, they get used to doing things the "easy way".

It's basically why they also prefer using Stingrays without warrants all the time, too, and even trick judges into thinking the devices aren't nearly as intrusive as they are, when needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With iris technology that can already identify you from [40 feet away](http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/iris-scanner-identifies-a-person-40-feet-away-150410.htm), we should expect the government has "our irises" already and therefore it's not a safe technology for authenticating to mobile devices or services.

At least fingerprints (especially ultrasonic 3D ones) are a little harder to collect from online photos or from everywhere you've been. Faces/irises should be much easier to collect from online photos and public/airport cameras. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So ugh, this is a very complex issue so I suggest everyone reads the article before they make up their minds. It's a great article.

Ultimately, you know a law is bad when it doesn't apply equally to everyone. I always like to say that if it doesn't apply to those in power as well (or the rich), then the law *should not exist*. Take the drug laws. They always seem to affect the poorest of the people the most, yet actors or other rich people get to go to "stress clinics" when caught. If drugs are so terrible they need harsh punishments then why don't they apply equally to everyone?

But returning to this issue, this treaty not only *allows* the NSA (and the rest of the Five Eyes nations) to keep buying zero-days from those same "evil hackers" the the treaty is meant to stop, but it actually *forces* good security researchers to share their zero-days exploits with the NSA (kind of how [Apple](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/12/obama-to-sign-executive-order-on-cybersecurity-threats/) has agreed to do recently voluntarily and how Microsoft has been doing it for a [long time](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms)), so the NSA can exploit them themselves. So from the get-go the treaty is a *farce*.

Also, here's another strong argument for why this shouldn't pass. It wants to stop hackers from selling exploits to China but give them to the US, right? That creates a terrible incentive for the US in terms of (actual) cyber-security. 

The US already barely cares about "cyber-security", despite its claims and chest-beating that it does. What it really means is it cares about passing new surveillance laws and new ways to hack people's computers. That's not cyber-security.

But as long as China and others keep attacking your bad security defense, it will have no choice but to *start caring* about security defense as well. And it has already started doing that lately, by starting to switch all federal websites to HTTPS for instance.

Now, if this treaty passes, then the US will feel once again too comfortable for its own good in terms of security defense. Not only that, but now that the US would get to have many more zero-days in its arsenal than "rival nations", or even most of those in the 41 Wassenaar nations, since only the Five Eyes seem to be exempt from it, then it will *want* most software to keep remaining vulnerable.

So despite the theoretical "good" that this treaty could do, we already know it will only make NSA spying and hacking much worse. That's reason enough to oppose this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many people, especially in poorer countries are getting *first* familiarized with Android and may not even know what Windows is until many years later (if ever). It would be very smart of Google to take advantage of that by "upselling" them to Android laptops, too with an interface that makes sense for the desktop of course. 

Too many people think that Android has to look *just like on the phone* on the desktop - and then they inevitably think "Android on desktop would suck!". That's not true. The interface can (and should) be optimized for the desktop. 

Android on the desktop may not be as "feature rich" as Windows, but if people like Chrome OS, then Android on the destop could be "Chrome OS on steroids". 

Also, Android should have another *major* advantage over Windows: touch optimized apps. If people are first introduced to "touch apps", then they will want to use touch apps *in all situations*. Android laptops would make that a very natural progression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like that rumored 2+ years of OS updates (so 2 major versions in this case) + another year of security updates after that.

That seems quite optimal and I hope other OEMs follow that. Unfortunately even if they do it, it will only be for high-end devices. That's why Google still needs to push a plan to update *all* devices, at the very least for security updates if not features. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So if Microsoft quietely admitting Windows Phone is dead? Why doesn't it just come out and say it, rather than play this "oh WP is totally alive, we're just going to put 10x more resources on the other 2 platforms - that's all".

WP users should be the most upset about that, as they'll be lied for years more by Microsoft that the company will totally continue to support the platform, while in reality it will focus more on Android and iOS and starve Windows Phone/Mobile of development resources, until it goes out with a whimper rather than a bang.

I just feel it's very dishonest and unfair to do that to current *and future* Windows mobile users by misleading them this way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intel still has a lot of "x86 baggage". You know how we can find that out? It's easy.

ARM chips:

1) cost less per die area

2) same performance or better (usually better) at high-end for instance, or mid-range or whatever level you want to compare

3) yet they are like 1-2 process nodes *behind* Intel's process nodes.

How is it possible for ARM chips to cost significantly less, have at least as much performance at a given level, and yet do all that on a 1-2 generations old process node? It's possible because Intel's chips are bloated. 

If Intel would put the latest high-end ARM core on its own 14nm process and compare it with latest Atom, at the same power envelope, it wouldn't even be close. The ARM core would be like 2x faster, while still costing half as much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. Intel is not competitive on a "performance per price" metric. Not even close. The only way it has been able to *look* like it's competitive on that metric so far is because it would heavily subsidize its chips with profits from the PC chip business.

Now they've said they won't do that anymore, but it will be hard to verify since they've just unified the 2 divisions (mobile and PC). However, there was already an announcement that for the next version or something of the Zenfone 2, Asus would use a *lower performance* Snapdragon 615. 

Why? Because Intel is not selling that Atom or its successor at the *same price level as the Snapdragon 615* as it's doing now. So if Intel raises its prices, Asus can't sell a "mid-range phone with a high-end chip" for $250 anymore. It will have to buy a mid-range chip for a *real* price, not a subsidized one.

And if Intel has to compete with other high-end chips in high-end phones with real prices, it loses, because high-end Arm chips like the Snapdragon 820 for instance will have better performance for *half the price* of a high-end Atom (Cherrywell or whatever they are calling the new one). </TEXT>

Even without that, they could just ask for a "bigger budget" for some *other programs* in the future (without actually telling the whole Congress what they are - after all even the Intelligence Committee doesn't know about most of them, as per Dianne Feinstein) and then use that budget to restart it under some other name and authorization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How many times have they "closed" programs in the past, only to rename them to something else and not only keep doing it, but *expanding* it.

Room 641a (AT T cable tapping) comes to mind where they got "caught", promised to shutter it, and yet the Snowden revelations show us that they have *cable access* to *all* traffic in the US.

Anyway, this isn't even their largest program - not even close. The Patriot Act accounts to less than 5% of their mass spying. The rest is done through the FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (bound for renewal in 2018 I think) and the Executive Order 12333.

The Patriot Act Section 215 was *mainly* about phone records (although they probably interpreted it to mean Internet records too in some cases), but the FAA 702 and EO1233 allows them to capture *all web traffic*, including content, which also includes your Skype calls, emails, SMS, chats and so on. Those are far my dangerous than the Patriot Act 215. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If *it is* because something like this, they probably wouldn't want to tell us anyway, because that would show how reckless and incompetent the airline companies were to connect the entertainment systems to the critical systems, even if there is a "firewall" between them (because hackers have never bypassed those before...).

This is precisely what worries me *greatly* about "smart" cars and self-driving cars. If the companies don't *completely* separate the two types of systems through an air gap, and give *absolutely no network connection* to the critical system, we could see a lot of hacks happening, even mid-driving.

 The "no network access" part probably won't happen, though, as with self-driving cars they will be pushing V2V technology, which means for it to be effective the critical system that includes breaks and engine and whatnot will need to communicate with that network. But at least I hope they put the two systems on *different chips*. 

Make no mistake, though, the vast majority of "self-driving car accidents" won't happen because the self-driving AI is not good enough. They'll happen because of hacks into people's cars. 

Combine that with virtually unaccountable spy agencies (not just US, but everywhere) and that future is quite terrifying indeed, considering we only know about most of their hacks from a whistleblower, not because they were *detected* after the fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are the most likely battery technologies to succeed in the next 5-10 years, though?

From what I've read there are [quite](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/01/28/your-smartphone-battery-sucks-this-mit-startup-could-change-that/) a few [startups](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/secretive-company-claims-battery-breakthrough/) that promise to "commercialize solid state batteries" by 2018. Both [Apple](http://revolution-green.com/solid-state-batteries-apple-and-toyotas-next-big-thing/) and [Google](http://www.slashgear.com/google-is-working-on-solid-state-batteries-that-last-longer-than-typical-batteries-12378543/) also seem to be researching them and Apple wants to launch its electric car in 2020 or so. 

Solid state batteries also seem to have 50-100% higher density (up to 1200Wh/liter) than regular li-ion batteries, higher life cycles, and they are safer too (due to lack of liquid electrolyte), which could be great for electric cars.

I can't find the link now but there was some li-ion Nobel prize winner or something also working on solid state batteries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was kind of the point of the article. The US is too focused to pass a law for itself instead of working within an international body to set space mining standards.

The US has no plans to mine the moon currently for instance, and this new law doesn't even apply to the moon, only asteroids. China has already announced that it plans to go to the moon soon, and as the article says it could say "that whole land where water is on the moon is OURS". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm inclining more and more to believe that Tor needs to become P2P where everyone is an exit node.

That seems to have worked pretty well for torrenting/piracy. Imagine if torrents didn't work the way they do now and only a few "special" nodes would upload the content to others. That would make those targets much more appealing to law enforcement and seeders wouldn't be able to "hide within the masses" as they do now.

This has turned out to be such an insurmountable probable for the anti-piracy guys that they just prefer to focus on other *centralized* places such as websites that keep the torrents.

So we already have proof that such a P2P strategy "works", despite the fear of many that they don't want "all the illegal stuff" to go through their computers. 

Also, perhaps the client could make everyone an exit node by default, but somewhere deep in the settings it could still allow people to disable their client from being an exit node and make it only a relay node. Then those who are really terrified about the prospect of being an exit node can just turn that off. Win-win right?

The current strategy of having a few thousand nodes will never work, and it's only going to become worse as NSA increases its budget and capabilities. Those thousand nodes will be overwhelmed by NSA's own nodes.

Even if we turn millions of relay nodes into exit nodes I'd still worry the NSA has the capability to mess with that, but at least it would be a much smaller chance. Also, if Tor ever gets to something like 100 million users (you never know, especially with more oppressive countries going online in the next decade) that should make it almost impossible for any agency to cryptanalize the Tor traffic - but only if we make everyone an exit node. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm saying support for obsolete protocols should be *dropped* at some point (in this case by browser vendors, but it could be OpenSSH maintainers, and so on). Those who drop it should announce ahead of time, but after that it's everyone else's responsibility.

If as you say the problem is some incompetent IT admin configured the security to use an old protocol and didn't pay attention to the latest security news, then eventually he should notice that his sites just stop working. However that *didn't happen*, for example in the case of 512-bit DHE, which should've been dropped a *long time ago*. 

People in charge of security at browser vendors decided to "be easy" on the incompetent IT admins and leave 512-bit DHE in there for another 10 years, even if it could be broken with a few PCs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What bothers me most about decisions such as "Well, we can't dump this protocol yet because 30% of the servers still use it" is that they don't also present a deadline for when they'll stop supporting that protocol.

Fine, keep 1024-bit DHE support now. But where's the deadline for when you'll drop it? Maybe they didn't want to rush such a decision and perhaps we'll still see Google announce a plan like they did for SHA1.

However, I really do believe that's how the security industry needs to think from now on. Will a protocol start to look weak in 5 years? Prepare a 3 year plan to get everyone off it. Is the protocol *already too weak* to be considered very secure? Create an even more aggressive plan to phase it out. 

This kind of mentality needs to permeate everything security related on the web from now on. No more using 2 decades old broken crypto because it just happened to remain in the software and nobody bothered to push it out "because it might break some things". That excuse would not be valid if the security industry was a little more pro-active. </TEXT>

Which do you think is more likely?

https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet

https://pond.imperialviolet.org/

Both work only over Tor, but they are still experimental. Otherwise see if you can find something you like here:

https://www.privacytools.io/

And you might want to give Peerio a try. It uses https://minilock.io/ to encrypt everything on the client side, and keeps the data for easy access on Peerio's servers (kind of like Spideroak in that regard, except it's a messaging/email-like client).

On mobile Signal/TextSecure is your best bet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is you're describing ideal stuff - stuff that will likely never happen, like "humans committing no crime". Okay - define what's "crime"? Being gay? Having sex with a robot? Masturbating to "teen" cartoons? Carrying [too much cash](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/11/how-the-dea-took-a-young-mans-life-savings-without-ever-charging-him-of-a-crime/) with you on a trip?

Crimes are defined by the society, and often by abusive law enforcement agents who re-interpret the law to their liking. Crimes not something that are completely objective. Therefore you can't put that in algorithms.

As for a "completely secure machine that you can trust" - yeah, that's not going to happen either. Right now the whole cryptographic community agrees you [can't build perfectly secure systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk78_zmH4QI), in most cases not just because of the poor design of the crypto-systems (which also happens [quite a bit](http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2407891/dumb-crypto-in-smart-grids-smart-meter-encryption-standard-fundamentally-flawed-claim-researchers)) but because of the code written for them. Maybe we can revisit this topic in 50 or 100 years when we all talk through quantum networks, but my guess is not much will change by then either in terms of breaking systems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe. Possibly. Who really knows. Whatsapp has never publicly stated they do that, never changed their privacy policy to adopt that, and there's no visible change in the UI that shows (or guarantees) you you're using end-to-end encryption.

http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Keeping-Tabs-on-WhatsApp-s-Encryption-2630361.html

In other words, you shouldn't trust that yet. Just use TextSecure (the integrated Signal version with Voice should come real soon.)

EDIT: By the way, I see some people are genuinely surprised that Hangouts is *not* end-to-end encrypted (you shouldn't be - you should've assumed that *by default*, otherwise you would've learned about it), but just to make things clearer for everyone **Skype also doesn't use end-to-end encryption**.

In fact Microsoft specifically killed its P2P capability to make Skype more wiretappable. Also Microsoft has either outright *lied* or avoided saying it has changed its architecture like this - so much that even one week before the Snowden revelations, the New York Times was recommending Skype as "secure for activists" (which became a laughable fact post-Snowden).

Now, I'm sure Tesla has pretty good engineers who understand why security will be important for stuff like that, unlike say [BMW](http://hackaday.com/2015/02/01/bmw-remote-unlock-wasnt-using-secure-http/)...but either way, no system is infallible to hacking. And this stuff can kill you - while you're on the road. Say you're on the highway with high speed. All the hackers need to do to kill you is turn your wheels a little and lock them in that position. </TEXT>

This is unlike virtually all of its competitors who want to be "futuristic" or whatever with their electric cars on the outside, which makes them look weird on the road, and many still haven't completely redesigned their cars to be fully electric from the ground up, and instead re-use some of the old design and stick a battery and a motor inside, which makes them less efficient as EVs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We'll probably see such a car by 2022, even from Tesla. But there will be others who will probably launch one sooner (such as Nissan). 

The batteries make a big proportion of a cheaper car's cost. By then EV technology should be more mature, at bigger scales (cheaper), and Tesla will probably have several Gigafactories online (not to mention Samsung LG becoming a lot more aggressive with their own battery businesses too). I expect batteries to drop in price by 75% or so by 2022, so it should be possible to have even a $15,000 car with a 100 mile range, or a $20,000 one with a 200 mile range. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because other browsers that do allow Adblock exist. You may say "yeah, but that's what - 5% of their users? Why would they care?"

They would care because that's a category of people that's highly influential/vocal/know-it-all tech types. In other words, the same people that started using Chrome from the early days and recommended everyone they knew (and they tend to also be the type that everyone asks for computer advice) to use it, too.

If Google loses that group of people, it's over for Chrome. Not overnight, obviously, as it will still take some time for those who left to convince the rest to switch yet again to another "better" browser, but that's just a matter of time. </TEXT>

http://motherboard.vice.com/read/one-of-the-biggest-privacy-wins-in-recent-memory-has-been-reversed

Solution:

1) Use only services *based* outside of US (make sure they don't have servers in US, because many foreign services do)

2) if you do use a US service to store your data, you have to encrypt it locally on your PC before uploading it, and only you have to have the key

3) use only end-to-end encrypted communication tools (Signal/Textsecure, Peerio, Tox, etc) </TEXT>

This should apply to all companies that "hold your data". And even if that's not explicitly clear quite yet, law enforcement has already been using the third-party doctrine like that, or at least the NSA has. Now they have even more reason to do it.

Lesson: don't keep your data in other people's servers, unless you encrypt it before you upload it there yourself and only you have the encryption key. Or don't use services based in US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hybrids are *at best* a "transitional" product. We're going to see much less demand for hybrids than full EVs. "Future" cars will all be fully electric. The problem with hybrids is that you need the whole "cruft" of the gas-powered designs and then add the battery-related components as well, making for a very inefficient design both in terms of cost and space.

I understand why people say they need a hybrid though - the range may not be good enough yet for *some* or for a certain lower price point, but as batteries improve in cost (and they do by 8% each year), EVs will become "good enough" for more and more people.

If you look back at all disruptive technologies, they all start out as "good enough" only for some people, and as they improve they become "good enough" for the majority later on (SSD's vs HDDs, notebooks vs PCs, etc). </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's short term thinking and you know it. Solar panels have come down drastically in price over the past few years. Batteries are likely to  cost half as much too in about 5 years, once the Gigafactory 1 is in full production, and they'll come down in price even more as Tesla builds more of them. There's also a ~8% improvement in energy density/pricing every year, even without the Gigafactories.

People have been saying for years that solar can't be competitive, and now the voices are dying down as solar quickly becomes more competitive. What makes you think solar and batteries are as good as they'll ever get *now*?!

The industry is just scratching the surface as investments are just *now* starting to treat solar/batteries seriously. Wait until this thing becomes "obvious" for everyone, and more companies and countries decide to invest billions into researching the technology and scaling the production.

I think by 2040 80% of the world's energy will be from solar/batteries. We might try to push for more, but even I think the rest 20% should probably come from something like *fusion* (I think we'll figure it out by then) or at least thorium reactors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Moxie is too focused on "but we've already said it's not working with iOS!"

I don't think that was the *main* point of the article, but the fact that you can't TRUST Whatsapp to properly use TextSecure encryption  - iOS or not.

1) Whatsapp has never made it public itself that it's doing this (ok, still in "deployment" so we'll see what they do when it's "finished")

2) No privacy policy change yet, and I think there should be one - also eagerly awaiting for this

3) No fingerprint authentication or any way to ensure that the e2e encryption is working

Again this is supposedly "not done yet" - so we'll see. However, Moxie and his team have consistenly promoted Whatsapp as "secure" already *because* of that "unfinished implementation". They even had a small argument on Twitter with Telegram over it saying that Whatsapp is more secure than Telegram because of it.

I do agree Telegram encryption sucks, but I don't think they should say Whatsapp is so much more secure, because at this point Whatsapp's E2E encryption is nothing more but "vaporware". Until Whatsapp resolves the 3 issues I mentioned above, that's exactly what it is. 

I'm a big fan of Moxie and I can't wait until Signal arrives on Android (and on desktop, too, hopefully) but I hate that Whatsapp is getting so much good press over this without being anywhere near ready or even officially committing to adopting this type of encryption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EFF's opinion on it (they don't like it in full, but they ultimately think it's a step forward and recommend Congress to vote YES on it):

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done

My biggest worry is that we'll pass this and everyone will be like "WE DID IT REDDIT! WE DID IT!!", as if we achieved some grand thing and now NSA's mass spying is over, and then they'll have zero interest in pursuing future such bills anymore.

At best this *scales back* on the 215 section of the Patriot Act. An improvement for sure, but the NSA has dozens other spying programs, including some more major ones such as the FISA Amendments Act, section 702, the EO 12333, the new "cyber threat sharing" laws which will most likely pass because "OMG CYBERWAR IS COMING and we need this bill because...I don't know - *probably* helps?!"

Then there are stingrays which the FBI *knows* are illegal and try to hide them from Courts, and who knows how many other such things which aren't even coded into the law like stuff in the Patriot Act was.

Think of "winning against mass and abusive spying" like a "meter" we need to fill. If we pass this one, we've maybe filled the meter 5%. We still have a long way to go to fill it completely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree. In fact, I agree so much with you that I think Microsoft should also allow its "universal apps" to be truly universal and run on *other platforms* as well, such as Linux or Android or Chrome OS, just like Google allowed Android apps to be ported to other platforms as well (Blackberry, Tizen, now Windows 10, etc).

<TEXT>  "The fact that SHA-2 cant be used with older browsers and OSs means that untrusted certificate warnings are going to become commonplace," Munro explained. "And if that happens, the danger is that many users will simply ride rough-shod over such pop-ups, potentially creating the ideal opportunity for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks."

Meh. Let's face it - the people that are still on XP and Android 2.2 were going to click through that sort of stuff anyway, even if everything was nice and compatible until one day they suddenly get a MITM attack. 

I'd rather not keep everyone else less vulnerable because of 1% of the market that's likely to be the the least tech-literate anyway. </TEXT>

Misiunea de securitate ar presupune sisteme securiate foarte bine. Dar pentru o agentie de spionaj misiunea de spionaj o sa castige intotdeauna impotriva misiunii de securitate.

De aceea UE a propus ca agentii *civile* sa se ocupe de securitate cibernetica (de ce ar fi un secret de stat ca un hacker sparge computerele unei companii?!). Plus ca acest lucru ar fi mult mai democratic. 

Nu inteleg de ce trebuie amestecate legile de colectare a datelor si spionaj cu "securitatea cibernetica" - nu au nici o legatura una cu alta. Trebuie sa fie legi separate (iar din punctul meu de vedere prima trebuie limita si mai mult). </TEXT>

If the strike or protest was only after work hours and in "free speech zones" where it bothers no one, the leadership wouldn't have to do a thing about the protesters' demands, since they wouldn't be inconvenienced in the slightest by it.

The protesters' "negotiation power" with the leadership comes from that inconvenience it causes to the leadership. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're security paranoid, then you "shouldn't trust Microsoft" because once Microsoft discovers new vulnerabilities in its operating system (including Bitlocker) it hands them over to the NSA before it releases a fix months later when it gets around to fixing the vulnerability.

http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms.html

Apple is now doing the same, starting with the new "cyber-threat sharing" executive order announced a couple of months ago, for which Apple got a very good deal from the government (integrating Apple Pay with [federal services](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/13/apple-ceo-tim-cook-cybersecurity-summit/)).

Both Microsoft and now Apple are doing this as a *choice*. They can't even use the excuse that "it's the law!" (at least until CISA and such pass - and then they'll get immunity for doing it, just like the carriers did for over-sharing data with law enforcement). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intel still has to license AMD64 (the real "x64" architecture) from AMD, too. So unless Intel suddenly has no need for 64-bit chips anymore, I think it's going to agree to give Samsung the x86 license, too.

And even if that wasn't an issue, it seems highly unlikely Intel will just say "NO! We will be the only ones with x86...MUAHAHAHA! Come at us antitrust bodies. We double dare you!"

Worst case scenario they increase the license price in a renegotiation contract.

If Samsung is smart though, it could even *lower* the price by telling Intel "how about we agree to use your shitty  lower-end Atom chips in some of our low-cost/mass volume devices for a couple of years and you drop the x86 license cost by 20% - deal?!"

Intel would be foaming at the mouth to get that deal and "increase its market share" in mobile.

Then 2 years later Samsung uses only Exynos chip lines in its own devices with its own CPUs and GPUs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Windows 7 is 4x-10x more popular, depending which stat company you believe.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows#Usage_share

Windows XP is a rich ground for malware and viruses because of its:

1) weak security (much weaker than Vista+)

2) no updates to at least keep the zero-day vulnerabilities in check

Using Windows for such safety-critical systems is BRAIN-DEAD STUPID. They shouldn't be using an OS with 90% share of the desktop market that even script-kiddies can hack (especially when not patched). And I would say the very same thing if it was Android what they were running.

Critical systems like these should be using highly custom and *security hardened* operating systems. What if North Korea reverse-engineered Stuxnet (they can probably already buy such a version from the black market by now anyway) and sends it to Japan's nuclear facilities now?! Heck, China has already been poking Japan lately over the islands issue.

Governments using Windows for safety and security critical infrastructure is STUPID (that goes for the US Department of Defense, too). I can't repeat that enough. </TEXT>

I would much rather put the blame on "app developers", who *choose* to make dozens and dozens of IM applications available on app stores, yet you could count on one hand the ones who have strong encryption.

When app developers choose to use strong encryption it's also much easier to get millions and millions of people to use strong encryption than if you try to convince every user one by one.

When there will be a dozen+ such apps to choose from, *then* we can start blaming the users for being so ignorant and foolish for not using those apps instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Mr Zhang said the flaws they uncovered were likely to be widespread throughout handsets running Android 5.0 and below. Updating to the latest version of Android, version 5.1.1, should remove the vulnerabilities, he said.

Well that should be easy!

*laughing*...*then crying*

 In April last year, hackers discovered a way to fool the print sensor on the S5 by taking a photograph of a print left on a smartphone screen, making a mould from the image and using that to make a replica fake finger.
In 2013, a German hacker group used a similar method to bypass the fingerprint reader on Apple's iPhone 5. Hackers from the Chaos Computer Club used a picture of a person's fingerprint left on a glass surface to make a fake finger that unlocked the phone.

WTF? Why the hell are companies releasing such features with *known flaws* - especially ones so obviously bad. I think I'll wait until Qualcomm's Sense ID "3D fingerprint" reader to arrive, before I trust using them, but I bet it's only going to be a matter of time before that one gets spoofed, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. Sony has had better sensors than Apple over the past 2-3 years, because it was giving Apple lower-end/older ones, yet somehow Apple still managed to beat them almost every single time because of software optimization. 

At least at the high-end they use the most cutting edge hardware to make up for their software deficiencies for the most part, but where it's most noticeable that Sony's camera software isn't that great is on mid-range and lower-end phones where Sony's cameras are crap.

With Android 5.0, Google has also given OEMs great camera APIs with high performance processing, so now they can't use the excuse that it's Google's stock software anymore or anything like that (even though I think most of the big OEMs have been using their own custom firmware for a while, and they haven't been using Google's firmware much). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Screw having sympathy for any company or any country going through a disaster in the future. It seems every time it happens, they use that sympathy of millions as an *excuse* to do exactly what they say makes them a victim.

**France** - says the terrorists are attacking their free speech! Millions rally to support that free speech - then France passes mass surveillance and censorship law, attacking the very free speech they said it was getting attacked by others.

**Sony** - gets hacked and threatened not to publish the movie - says 'Murrica's free speech is under attack. Now a new cyber-surveillance law is being passed and Sony threatens anyone who dares to publish anything about the leaked documents.

So fuck it! The next time something like this happens, they are on their on. I'm not going to let them use my sympathy again as an excuse to pass yet another draconian law in the defense of the very thing they complain about getting attacked. </TEXT>

I happen to believe the idea for the new EU VAT system is a great one, because it distributes that VAT. It's just that it creates a terrible bureaucratic mess. All of that mess would be wiped clean if there was only one VAT tax across EU, and businesses wouldn't have to keep 75 (multiple countries have more than one VAT tax) different VAT values in mind when selling to EU countries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2015 is finally the year where Android users can choose between premium feeling Android devices with materials that include: glass, metal or leather. No more cheap plasticky-feeling flagship devices.

That said, what annoys me about Sony is that it launches its devices in a weird cycle like September. This means it will end up with an obsolete chip like Snapdragon 810 or 808, when 820 could arrive in devices in November. And this has happened more than once with the Z-series. Quite frustrating. 

Sony should be planning its devices according to when a next-generation chip comes out. Samsung, HTC and LG always do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What he's trying to say is that NSA has access to all the "regular phone calls and text messages" - a.k.a. the carriers' networks.

What you need to do is use something like Signal for iOS or Redphone/Textsecure for Android. Also, if you root the phone you can install the SnoopSnitch app (Android) to protect yourself against fake cell towers they have installed to capture radio signals and intercept them. However, rooting also invites easier hacking on your phone, so it might be best you don't know that. Just use the apps I mentioned and careful what you say over the carriers' networks. </TEXT>

Huh, go figure. So it was possible to upgrade the networks and give customers much better Internet after all!

That said, I still believe they will be using shenanigans, and even if your connection on one of these ISPs is 200 Mbps, Netflix will probably still be throttled, or you'll get a much lower average speed most of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tutanota is interesting, however I think they are making it *really hard* to figure out how they are encrypting their stuff. You have to scour through 50 small-font FAQ questions on a third party site where each has to open in a new window, and after you do manage to find the relevant questions 30 minutes later you're still not 100% sure you understood how they are doing it.

At the end, the best I could get is that it's *not* using PGP but some kind of custom RSA/AES based "end to end" encryption (?!).

Compare that to Whiteout, where you get a pretty good idea of how it works from a single page:

https://whiteout.io/technology.html

<TEXT> It's hard to tell for now, really. I would say it won't be until at least Android M or even N, when we can really answer this question.

Stuff like ART or the Material Design didn't rise under Pichai, but Rubin. They were both 2-3 year old projects when Lollipop was announced.

If anything, Pichai is *limiting* Android, but not *allowing* the developers to turn it into a "desktop OS" as well and *really* compete against Windows, just like they used Android to create Android Auto, Android Wear and Android TV - all having quite different interfaces than the phone version of Android. They could do the same with "Android PC". 

Just add a taskbar, multi-window support and encourage developers to optimize their apps for the desktop and OEMs to put it on laptops/hybrid devices. Why do that through the "backdoor" with the browser-based Chrome OS, one app at a time? (Android apps don't work *automatically* on Chrome OS). </TEXT>

I'd also like to see a much more intuitive interface for unblocking certain elements. I don't understand what all the pluses and minuses mean there. It would be better if it would be marked what's allowed with a green icon and with red what isn't.

I've heard 2 of the main developers (including its creator) left the project. But I assume something as popular as uBlock already has a big enough community to support its future development.

1) Google's Fiber business is *sustainable* (if only 1% of the cable customers subscribe to Google Fiber in all cities, Google Fiber will fail, and we'll lose the main incentive for Comcast/TWC/AT T to keep upgrading).

2) Google Fiber continues to *expand* in other cities as well, so  the competition increases in those places, too, not just in some places.

Besides, it's very likely Google Fiber will either have the faster speed, lower price, unlimited bandwidth, or a better "constant speed" than these guys anyway, no matter what they're promising now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  we're about to see much slower progress than we used to

Moore's Law is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The rate of progress will continue with or without "Moore's Law" (which specifically states that the number of transistors per die area will double every 18 months).

Here's an example to understand what Moore's Law is and isn't. Let's say we come up with a new type of transistor, like one based on graphene, and once we reach the physical limits for the size of tranzistors (close to an atom's size), we'll use something like graphene transistors to *increase frequency* every 18 months or whatever. Then, even though we won't have a "doubling of the number of transistors per die area" every 18 months anymore (so no more Moore's Law), we'd still have this "doubling of frequency" every 18 months (just an example). The point is we'd *still* have a good rate of progress even without Moore's Law. And that rate of progress would once again confirm the law of accelerated returns (even if we find another name of the "law of doubling frequency" - that would be just a *niche* within the law of accelerated returns). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does remind me of this:

 The IPSEC standards also mandated support for the "null"
     encryption option (plaintext hiding in supposedly-encrypted
     packets), for 56-bit Single DES, and for the use of a 768-bit
     Diffie-Hellman group, all of which are insecure and each of which
     renders the protocol subject to downgrade attacks.

https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg12325.html

As we've seen with the recent SSL3 attack, it's sometimes easier to break an encryption scheme if you can downgrade it to weaker algorithms. It helps if you make the whole protocol overly complex as well to the point where it's *easy to mess up*. That sounds like a very sound strategy for the NSA to use within standards groups while still preserving "plausible deniability" and being relatively subtle about it. </TEXT>

But if we're talking about say a single PC chip, Moore's Law as you "understand it" is absolutely NOT true anymore. The doubling of transistors per die area *is*, but not the "doubling in performance" every 18 months.

<TEXT> Microsoft puts a "lot of effort" into Android because it has no choice. As a platform, Android is bigger than Windows now (yes, you read that right).

Windows phones and tablet market share on the other hand are in low single digits market share.

And just like Microsoft, Google *also* builds apps and such for the desktop Windows platform - why? Because it wants to? No. Because it *has to*, since the Windows platform is still huge on the desktop.

None of them are doing it out of the goodness of their own hearts. That's just PR bullshit that intends to make Microsoft look good.

Apple doesn't give a f%#k because it makes 98% of its money from hardware. Both Google and Microsoft make their money from services and software. Of course Microsoft would want to build an Office app for Android. If Office is not popular on Android, then something else would become popular for soon to be 2 billion users. If it makes its app on Android, then Office still has a chance of remaining popular.

Do you understand now that it has nothing to do with "being a good guy" or being selfless?! If Microsoft was a good guy they'd stop harassing OEMs with bogus patents and extorting billions a year from them. But guess what? Microsoft only cares about what makes them money. And in this case, it's Android. </TEXT>

Audit of miniLock (although in this case an audit of Peerio itself would be preferable): https://cure53.de/pentest-report_minilock.pdf

I think what isn't open source about Peerio is basically the storage service. Their monetization model seems to be like: "Allow users to encrypt end to end with native clients, but they can store those encrypted files on our servers for easy access/transmission - 1GB free, after that you pay". So in that way it's kind of like Spideroak, except you can actually "communicate" through an e-mail like interface with Peerio.

Peerio without a "third-party" storage service is essentially miniLock (encrypt and send the file over whatever medium you want). </TEXT>

There's LavaBoom, too, but again I don't know much about it: https://lavaboom.com/about

There's also https://peerio.com/ which is more like "closed" email system, though (only works with Peerio accounts). I guess you could add it to "email alternatives". The main encryption system behind it, miniLock has already been audited, including by Matthew Green.

You might want to add [DNSChain](https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain) to the DNS list, too.

You should tweet your site at https://twitter.com/sggrc . He usually loves it when he stumbles upon "security tools charts" and such. He might give it a shout out in his Security Show next week. Worth a try. </TEXT>

But this still ends up being bad for Intel in the long term, as 1) the gov may or may not continue to use Intel for DoE supercomputers in the future, and it may just be a one-time deal, while in China it would've been a longer-term deal, and 2) China will still end up making a competitor.

Also, this way the US gov screwed Nvidia, too, as it would've been Nvidia or possibly AMD the one to get this contract (as it did the last time). </TEXT>

<TEXT> More competition and fewer opportunities for Intel to abuse its monopoly power in PCs and server markets by transferring the profits there to its mobile chips, so it can sell them under-cost to steal market share from ARM.

If the only way for you to be in a certain market and competitive, is to sell chips at 1/4 of their regular price, by subsidizing 75% of it, then you don't deserve to be in that market, let alone have any chance of "conquering" that market in this way. Because it just means that as soon as they "conquer" it and most ARM chip makers are dead, they'll go back to selling for 100% of the price again. So the consumer gets screwed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, Alibaba is already building datacenters in the US. So now you'll have Chinese companies offering online services to Americans, and then the Chinese government gets to access the data on those American users. 

What if a Chinese company builds the next Facebook? Or Instagram? Or big chat app?

This is not even an argument that I'm making alone. Here's what a former NSA chief said about this just [last week](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-let-america-be-boxed-in-by-its-own-computers/2015/04/02/30742192-cc04-11e4-8a46-b1dc9be5a8ff_story.html):

 In a perverse way, as the saying goes, what goes around comes around. Precedents we set will be followed  or exploited  by others in an economic system that becomes more globalized and hence more interdependent by the day. Already others point to U.S. activities to justify their own, often nefarious, efforts. Witness the Chinese trying to create moral and legal equivalency between legitimate U.S. intelligence and their massive theft of intellectual property, or their placement of newly minted restrictions on U.S. IT firms. One wonders what the Russias and Chinas of the world will demand if U.S.-based firms are forbidden to create encryption schemes inaccessible to themselves or the government. Beyond the realm of speculation, the Chinese company Alibaba has announced plans to open a cloud data center in the United States. **How will we feel when a Chinese court orders Alibaba to send data on Americans back to China, citing our own behavior as justification?**

 These are serious, long-term questions requiring serious, strategic answers. Possible second- and third-order effects  such as **generating a stampede toward data localization or a Balkanized Internet**  need to be considered alongside a still-important calculus based on more transient, tactical advantage.

A Balkanized Internet will hurt the US the *most* since it's the US that has the most to gain from the Internet right now, yet it's the US directly or indirectly pushing for that Internet to become much more limited, just like it has tried to limit the computation capabilities of its own companies in the past so other countries can't have access to them (more about this in the article as well). </TEXT>

The 2nd amendment talks about a *regulated militia's* right to bear arms - not everyone's. It's more like how they gave weapons to militia in Mexico to fight against the cartels, and registered them as militia. It's not about everyone and their grandmother having the right to own a gun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's what I find ridiculous about prosecutor charges/plea bargains.

Let's imagine the prosecutor charges Aaron Swartz with 35 years in prison. But then the prosecutor wants a plea bargain that would put Aaron in prison for *only 2 years*. But let's not imagine, because that *actually happened*.

So which is it? Is he a terrible danger to society that deserves 35 years in prison - or is it a relatively minor offense that should only get 2 years?

In reality, it's neither. Because for all intents and purposes Aaron Swartz was "innocent", innocent in the *spirit of the law* sense, not in the "everybody commits 3 felonies a day" *letter of the law* sense.

But prosecutors can abuse this plea bargain power and get even innocent people to accept prison time that only seems *small* in comparison to the initial exaggerated charge. In reality, for someone innocent, even that is too small - but they have may no choice, and would rather take "only 1/15th" of the initial prison time.

Back to the point, I think the jury would start *cutting through the bullshit*, and if he's indeed dangerous and a real criminal, then he will get maybe not 35 years that the prosecutor initially asks, but 20 years. On the other hand, if he's dangerous, but the prosecutor once a "sure-fire" 2 years in prison "win", then again the jury will stop that from happening.

If the whole thing is bullshit, and the guy is innocent, then the jury may save him. I think that would be a lot closer to "real justice" (regardless of whether the guy is innocent or guilty) than leaving everything to the prosecutor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that when the Patriot Act was announced - just after 9/11 mind you - they said it's going to be used "against terrorism...and *drug crimes*" should've been a HUGE FUCKING RED FLAG!

So you're telling me that you're in a hurry to pass a "new" law that wants to prevent the kind of terrorist attacks that have just happened....and you took the time to introduce *drug crimes* in there, too?! What the fuck?

The aspect alone should've made everyone think that the Patriot Act  was just another way for the government to expand its powers and remove more rights from citizens.

Lo and behold, more than a decade later, the Patriot Act and "National Security" Letters are used in something like 97 percent of the cases for *drug crimes*, not for actual "national security" issues (and that's ignoring the fact that in many instances the feds just claim "national security" for no good reason). </TEXT>

So what we're seeing is basically a sort of Moore's Law for batteries, but instead of the performance "doubling every 2 years", it doubles every 10 years. 

Still not bad at all, and a rate of improvement far greater than what we've seen in gas-powered cars. If this rate of progress lasts for 2-3 decades, we could see batteries at a given mileage be 10x cheaper than they are today, or last 10x more at the same price point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nvidia's main problem is one of strategy/vision, not one of technical expertise.

Nvidia's chips keep remaining power hungry as a *choice* made by Nvidia, because they want to win the "performance" game *at all costs*, and because they keep focusing on "tablets or larger" form factors. As such, it's really no wonder that their chips are *usually* (cough Snapdragon 810 cough) more power hungry than Qualcomm's chips, which focuses primarily on *smartphones* (with their low power envelope).

If Nvidia actually tried to make chips for phones with 1,500 mAh batteries, I'm sure they could release something competitive. But they *don't want* to do that. And unfortunately, I think they never will. They seem more interested in automotive and mini-consoles these days, which rely even less on power efficiency as a competitive goal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cash, marketing...not to mention the process node. Samsung's process node is the closest the industry has to Intel's now.

Not only was GloFo's node behind Samsung's or TSMC's before, but AMD itself, due to lack of money, didn't adopt the latest node too fast, which put them at an even greater disadvantage compared to Intel.

There are really very few negatives to Samsung buying it (even the Intel licensing thing - I'm sure Samsung and Intel can figure something out), and many more positives.

Also, don't forget that right now most people feel *pressured* into having a child by a certain age (especially women). What if we knew for a fact that we could live 500 years, or 5,000 years? Would you still want to have a baby at 25? 

Maybe eventually most of us won't even want kids (we could already see that as a *small* trend in well educated societies, where people postpone having kids). What if we figure out that we don't *need* to "extend our legacy" through kids, when we can just *be* that legacy ourselves?

<TEXT> This comment pisses me off, because what you said *exactly* is not accurate.

It's not the users' fault that the "uptake of new technology" is slow, which is what you're implying. When Apple releases a new technology in their OS, they update hundreds of millions of devices at once, and *that's how iOS users* get to all use that new technology at once.

On Android that's not really possible, because there are so many OEMs, each with their own goals, and sometimes they even push back against Google when Google is trying to make a new technology mainstream (such as Google Wallet). </TEXT>

Also from what I read, Intel's SGX is supposed to be much more secure and more advanced - with the "only" problem that Intel will have the key to all your "secured" apps, and they can have it stolen/give it to NSA with perfect plausible deniability ("Why really, we had no idea!").

EDIT: I found something, but meh, it doesn't seem to support ephemeral keys either:

<TEXT> Problema e ca dupa 2 saptamani, DNA va cere arestarea la domiciliu - care nu cred ca il va opri prea mult pe Mazare din a-si desfasura activitatea mafiota.

Sunt oarecum impartial deocamdata la ce face DNA pentru ca cred ca e un "rau necesar" la nivelul de coruptie de o avem noi, si ca sa putem sa ii prindem pe toti pana la urma. 

Dar pe termen lung, DNA de fapt abuzeaza sistemul, si ii aresteaza pe multi asa nu pentru ca ar fi ei nevinovati neaparat (sau poate sunt dar DNA nu are dovezile necesare - ceea ce iar e rau si abuziv daca aresteaza fara dovezi), ci pentru ca vor sa ii *sperie* pe multi pentru a da in vileag pe altii. Asta nu e o calitate a unui sistem de justitie *corect*. E o chestie abuziva.

Dar cum am zis, pe termen scurt, cred ca e oarecum necesar asta. Dar DNA nu mai poate continua prea mult asa pentru ca o sa inceapa sa isi piarda credibilitatea daca "aresteaza" 10, iar apoi le da drumul la 9 din ei. Incep sa isi dea oamenii seama ca aia 9 de fapt au fost arestati doar ca sa il prinda pe ala 1, si sa forteze o confesiune de la ei.

Oricum in cazul acesta, cred ca chiar vor sa il tina pe Mazare la inchisoare, nu doar sa obtina o confesiune impotriva lui Vanghelie sau mai stiu eu care. Dar in general cam asta tinde sa faca DNA. </TEXT>

But all the Microsoft fanbois saw Windows 8 gets somewhat faster *boot time*, and thought "Oh maaan....Windows 8 is soooo much *faster*", as if the speed of the boot time had any impact on general performance.

Also the faster *boot time* is faster in part because it doesn't boot the OS directly, but stops at the "lockscreen" (or whatever Microsoft calls that screen), but it still takes at least a minute after that to load everything up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Figured that this would be written by the American side of TheGuardian.

The Euro has NOT lost value - guy from a country with a different currency here, and the Euro value has been the same. *However* the dollar has *increased* in value.

So it's not that the Euro has lost value, but that the dollar has gained value. The difference here is that the title implies the Euro hasn't been stabled and has lost value, when in fact it's the dollar which hasn't been stable. By the headline's logic, *all the other currencies* would have "dropped in value" by 35 percent, too.

For Americans who are glad about this - I probably wouldn't be. You can import stuff that is cheaper now, but US companies might have to lay-off employees as they can't afford to pay them the same amount as before. Think of it as a "free" 20-30 percent increase in salary for everyone over the past 12 months. Obviously that will put a strain on most companies who don't make billions in profit every quarter or have huge margins. </TEXT>

Intr-o lume in care NSA poate [infiltra orice hard disk](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/) vor ei, e totusi greu de crezut ca vreun sistem, cat de laudat ar fi el, e foarte sigur pana la urma.

Nici macar nu au aparut bine pe piata standardele FIDO si EIDAS, si noi deja vrem vot electronic? Oricum sunt sigur ca o sa propuna ceva stupid si cu asta, cum ar fi sa ceara ca sa *stocheze ei* fingerprinturile noastre in baza de date - adica exact cum face si Estonia pentru programul de e-citizenship. Orice baza de date de acest fel va fi sparta intr-o saptamana de alte natiuni. Totusi sper ca sistemele care tin fingerprintul *pe telefon* in "secure storage" (cum face Apple Touch ID sau Qualcomm's Sense ID) si nu-l lasa niciunde altundeva sa "castige" pe piata.

Dar totusi eu zic sa vedem vreo 10 ani asa macar cum se comporta si sistemele de autentificare biometrica, si apoi mai vedem cu votul electronic. </TEXT>

* faces can data-mined orders of magnitude more than fingerprints, because we put pictures of our faces all the time on the Internet. 

* there's already the danger that the webcam might be spying on you. Even if Intel's technology requires dual-cameras on the machine and whatnot, whoever hacks into your PC, will be able to use that same camera and build a profile of your face

* I see nothing mentioned about them storing that data in a "secure enclave". Even if they decide to store it somewhere securely right now, it will probably be the TPM, which *isn't that secure*, especially when the laptop vendors (such as Lenovo) have the root keys to that as well

* it's not even compatible with FIDO, even though Windows 10 will be. If we're going to switch to biometrics, then we damn well make sure we're doing it as a standard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not how it works. Well ok, it is how it works, but only when you use the CPU directly, which Google did here (and it was dumb of them to do it).

But the way Apple does it, is it uses a *crypto-processor* that encrypts the data much faster. A similar kind of processor exists in *all 64-bit ARMv8 chips* - even the low-end Cortex A53 ones, such as the Snapdragon 410 inside the new Moto E.

So you should be able to use encryption with no problems on a device like the Moto E, even if it's "low-end". That's why I've always considered the "why would you need a 64-bit chip with 1GB of RAM on a $100 device?!" argument stupid. 

ARMv8 offers much more than just support for 4GB of RAM, but unfortunately that's how most people understood ARMv8, even here on /r/Android.

Apple has had automatic storage encryption for its devices since like the days of the 3GS - you know, that device with a 600Mhz CPU device with 256MB of RAM?

Encryption  is not an issue when done right. The problem is Google half-assed it, as usual. But I'm sure they'll fix it in the next-version. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Data 02.03.2015.

2*3 = 6

Iar apoi avem 2*(1+5) care e de 2 ori 6.

Deci avem trei de 6, adica 666. E clar un contract cu diavolul. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly why I don't understand how their solution for "cybersecurity" can be "more surveillance". These two are exact opposites. The NSA is now trying to push *terrible* cybersecurity policies, which just means they don't care about it at all. They just care about being able to spy some more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Am fost optimist ca o sa fie un partid bun, chiar daca sustinerea votului electronic m-a dezamagit. E extrem de nesigur si poate fi abuzat - trust me on this. Sa mai asteptam 10-20 ani totusi sa vedem ce sisteme de securitate mai apar care pot proteja voturile: quantum key distribution, blockchain security, biometric authentication. Desigur astea exista deja, dar "doar ce au aparut" intr-un fel. Sa le dam timp sa se maturizeze. Niciun sistem de vot electronic din lume existent acum nu e invulnerabil la hacking. Nici chiar cel al [Estoniei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY_pHvhE4os) (desi cei de la putere nu vor sa recunoasca - evident).

Dar faptul ca a zis ca Iohannis a gresit ca si-a facut principalul partener Germania, m-a facut sa displac noul partid aproape in intregime.

Hai totusi sa terminam cu ideea asta ca trebuie sa fim toate tarile vasale la SUA. Suntem parte din Uniunea Europeana. Let's act like it. Apropierea de Germania e un lucru foarte bun, si chiar practic (multi romani se simt mult mai apropiati de Germania decat SUA).

Si oricum, nu e ca si cum gata ne-am certat cu SUA, ceea ce s-ar intelege din ce zice Macovei. Din contra, cred ca s-a intarit acel parteneriat cu SUA in ultima vreme. SUA acum ne considera o tara foarte importanta in zona si un partener de care au nevoie in conflictul asta Rusia-Ucraina. 

Daca e sa ne fi certat cu cineva e UK, si sincer o merita, si nu zic asta doar pentru cum se poarta cu romanii care vin acolo (desi asta ar putea fi un motiv in sine), dar si pentru faptul ca ei cam vor sa devina un fel de China a Europei cu cenzura, spionari ilegale si imorale, numirea jurnalistilor "teroristi", etc. E mai bine ca nu suntem parteneri la o asemenea tara. Nu as vrea sa ni se traga si noua "ideile" astea. Plus ca UK cam intotdeauana au fost carcotasul Europei si s-au opus la multe lucruri bune pentru EU.

Iar faza cu 2 la suta din buget sa fie alocat Apararii chiar credeti ca a venit de la Iohannis? E clar ideea SUA, ca sa le cumparam armele lor. Am fi putut sa punem 2 la suta buget si sa cumparam avioane si arme din Suedia sau Franta, tari membre EU. Dar nu...am luat din SUA.

Deci nu e chiar asa cum zice Macovei. Relatia cu SUA e foarte buna. Dar prioritatea principala va trebui intotdeauna sa ramana EU, nu SUA, si nu doar pentru Romania, dar toate tarile EU. Trebuie sa ne ocupam in primul rand de interesele EU, nu ale SUA. </TEXT>
