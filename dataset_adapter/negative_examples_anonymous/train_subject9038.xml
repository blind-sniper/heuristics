<TEXT> So I was trainig one day and I was doing incline bicep curls and was just finishing my third set with a pair of 14kg dumbbells. So this guy next to me is doing preacher dumbbell curls with a 16kg dumbbell. And since I can't find the other 16kg dumbbells (not a huge gym) I am waiting for him to finish. And once he is done I ask him: "Hey, are you gonna use that dumbbell again soon?"
So he answers: "No, that was my last set."
At this point I just grab the 16kg dumbbells and all of a sudden he asks me: "Hey, just a quick Q - are you using "the chemistry"?"
And I was like: "Yeah, sure. Protein powder, creatine, you know." (Because hey, creatine is made in a lab, so in my understanding it's chemistry.)
And he was like: "No, no, no I mean "THE chemistry", as in steroids."
And I'm like: *laugh* "No man, I'm clean"
And just as I say that, I hear him say back in a turned on gay way: "Hmm, well you've done a lot of work and made 'em big"
And trust me, I was amazed by the compliment and that gave me sooo much motivation. Even though a gay dude said it. I knew he was gay btw, but that sentence just made me giggle on the inside. And it's not that I don't like gays, they're fine - a compliment is a compliment from whoever you receive it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since I am graduating from High School I won't be mentioning the books, pens and pencils, but I will tell you that I use a climber's backpack (a big one). So here goes:
1. A towel
2. Gym shoes
3. Gym clothes
4.  A pair of boxers and socks for after the shower
5. Shampoo
6. Dry roll-on (Rexona stuff, anti sweating)
7. Padded straps for deadlifts
8. Gloves (Yes, they match my backpack, haters)
9. Pair of earbuds for the gym (not gonna fuck up my Hammerheads)
10. Stretch marks creme
11. The case for the Hammerheads
12. A bottle of water
13. Shaker with powder in the powder compartment.
14. A miny funnel for my one dose of creatine (hate mixing it with the shake)
15. An umbrella
I guess that's all I carry :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to say left one (delts), because I am indeed like that. I am not able to get a huge chest out. However, it's not a flat one at all - just my weak point. Not to mention the "Terry Crews" gap I have.. at least a proportional one (the gap edges are like mirror images of one another).
Very good posts by the way, keep 'em up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arnold Schwarzenegger words: Chins, Pulls (Pulldowns etc.) are for the width. Any kind of rows (bent over, t-bar, seated cable, etc.) are for the thickness. Period.

And regarding my comment here: old-school is the real deal. Nowadays I see a lot of guys doing only mashines, because they think they put them in the right position. The problem of today is that there is a lot of information, which can be true AND wrong. I remember a guy telling me not to do squats, because they hurt your back. He also told me that nowadays there are mashines for those stuff. But to tell you the truth - the leg press at my gym hurts my back like hell, even thought "the mashine puts you in the right position".

So there is no magic behind the width and the thickness. Old-school is the best school! I train old school style and I can proudly say that I have made more progress than people who train the modern way (all out on the mashines). </TEXT>

<TEXT> At one point I was using MP Arnold Series Iron Pump, but realized I didn't really like such a huge pump. I know that it's *Arnold voice* the most satisfying feeling you can get in the gym, but I got a pump feeling without the supplement, and going above that wasn't for me. (Not to mention that my skin isn't "elastic" enough [not sure if elastic is the proper word], and I got lots of stretch marks on my biceps, triceps and shoulders) So I said to myself: "Well, I love the energy. I want energy!"
So when I finished the whole thing I switched to Hyphy M.U.D - yes, I indeed tried the Coke with Coffee thingy, and man i was sure happy I had the energy. I can even recall that I had a conversation with a buddy at the gym while lifting heavy ass weights for my biceps, while at an incline,  while being on Kali Muscle's stuff. And I hadn't even tried lifting those kilos before. So that's that.
Now I just take 3 packets of instant coffee and I'm good to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now that's a comment I like. It even better because it's from a girl's perspective. Great comment really.
I agree with everything. As I said I am willing to do the FWB thing, just didn't know what to do. And I was thinking about the cuddling thing. Damn that's my favorite thing :D Too bad
As Roosevelt's wife said: "Every day do something that frightens you" and since the FWB is something new to me I'm a bit scared really so that's why I am looking for comments like this one. Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well in my case we still chat, be friendly you know. She told me I can do everything just without the relationship and feelings. Personally I am not scared to commit. Maybe it's she who's scared. We are behaving like we are friends. But there will be benefits. Like in that movie. Even though life is never like that :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> There will be no question in my post. I just wanted to share that you Mr. Schwarzenegger inspired me to start fitness   bodybuilding. I was a newcomer to fitness and was searching for articles on the web and saw something like: Arnold Schwarzenegger - Mr. Olympia. I opened the page because... well I have grown with your movies, because my father always watched action movies and yeah terminator predator true lies (hope I'm not mistaking the name it's been a long time since I watched that movie which reminds me of downloading the soundtrack). Anyways back to the topic: so I saw a picture of your body from one of the competitions and said: if that man did it I can do it too. I was like you when you saw the picture or Reg Park. And I started reading your bio. Then bought the new encyclopedia of modern bodybuilding and yeah you can guess how it continues. Also wanted to tell you that you are not only an inspiration but you are the perfect example of a person who reached his goals in life (and is still reaching). I have learned a lot. 
I will never forget one sentence: "You can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets."
Thank you for everything :) </TEXT>

Both of them are pretty serious but I said to the main guy that I won't be serious and I will be more like a representative of those guilds. If they want they could kick me - they didn't do so. </TEXT>

Now I am happy to say that GW2 is better! You know the addiction to WoW you get when you play it. I had it but now with the help of GW2 everything changed :)
