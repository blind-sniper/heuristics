<TEXT> Agreed.  Saturday I walked into one of those BB mobile stores to see if they had any of the fitbit watches.   Sure enough they had every variation behind the counter.  I wanted to buy one so I asked the girl if I could look at it and her response was, "Why?  The box doesn't really tell you anything."  Thats really the only reason I go to the BB store is to feel and look at the product.   I did purchase one right after, but that girl was still a bitch.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll just include this now. 
This was the email he sent back.   Now remember I have sent a couple picks comparing the bearings.   I even gave the traxxas part number so if you looked it up online or Google you would even see what the bearing look like.    This was his reply:

"Look at what your asking.  
You want to send 8x12 back and to be replaced with 8x12.  We included 8x12. You asked for 8x12 and we sent more.  Now you want to send 8x12 back and get more 8x12?

I'm sorry. We have tried to get this taken care of for you but it's obvious you don't understand what you have or or what you need.  Please ask for some help from someone that understands what you need. "

Now I understand I am asking for the same size bearing.    It needs to have the same outer dimensions.   Both bearings are in fact 8x12.   

(Now under my mistake I linked him to 2 different links.  How I obtained these links was that I googled "8x12 bearing" and the Boca site came up with the bearings he keeps sending me.  The ones I don't need.   The second Google was "8x12x3.5 bearing" which also popped up the Boca site first which was the correct bearing I needed.   So I included those two links in my email when I should have just linked him to his own damn site to the bearing I needed)

I replied with this:
"Can you not see the picture I sent you?   
Look at your bearing compared to correct bearing.   
I need 8 of those.  
Looks at this kit.   They have the correct bearing.   Do you see how big the opening is?   
Can you not see the images I am sending?  
I never originally requested a size.  I said the bigger ones that fit the axles.  You went ahead and just sent 4 more.   You never waited for measurements.   I send 2 pictures showing the obvious difference of the inside diameter of the bearings.  You for some reason can't comprehend that the inside of the bearing you sent is to small for the right bearings.   I guess that is all we can do though.   If you can't tell the difference between bearings it's just a lost cause.   

This is the bearing size I need and what should have came in the kit I paid good money for.  Do you see the size?  8x12x3.5

http://www.bocabearings.com/bearing-inventory/Radial-Bearings/2814/8x12x3-5-MR1282GS?utm_source=googlefeed08292013 utm_medium=cpc utm_campaign=radial gclid=COj6qPLS_cQCFRABaQodREQAgg

This is what you keep sending me and not understanding that although they are the same size. It has a different inside diameter. 
Do you see the size 8x12?   Yes you are correct that is the same size as the one above, but if you look closely the inside diameter would not fit a revo 1/16 axle through that opening.   
http://www.bocabearings.com/bearing-inventory/Radial-Bearings/7491/0-6250x1-3750x0-3437-SR102RS

I hope you can see the difference.  

Thanks,

<TEXT> Yes it should be in more detail.   It should include the 3.5 at the end.  You can tell at the skinniness in the manual, but if you are going off just by that number you end up with the fatter bearings.  
Which I even explained to him in the email.   Which is when he told me this 

"You told me what size you needed and I sent them. Don't assume what you need.  Measure them. Every time you assume it coats be 6.00. If you want to measure what you need and send the other 8 bearings back I will be more then glad to get you what you need.  The original kit has the proper size bearings in it according to traxxas " -Ed

So he assumed and took the 8x12 measurement and sent me the fatter bearings.   I told him I need 8x12x3.5 the bearing with the bigger inside diameter. And I sent him a pic of the two bearings showing the difference.    I said I would send those 8 bearings in exchange for the other ones.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did twice.   I sent him the dimensions but he still insists that's what he sent me even tho they are the same outside diameter the inside ares clearly different.  I even told him the diameter but he insisted I measure.    
I will be uploading the email mag along with it just so everyone can see how ridiculous the whole situation was.   
I opted for a refund on everything.   I'm just going to go with Avid now.   They seem to understand the size of bearings after I spoke with them.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Fast Eddy bearings kits </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-17 18:16:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright so I ordered a Revo 1/16 bearing kit from 
FastEddyBearings.com.   The kit included everything except for the right size bearings for the knuckles and differential.  

What it included was (8) 8x12 bearings which is the right size, but not the right inner diameter.  The bearings that were included would not fit the stock Revo 1/16 axle through it.   

I emailed the company and received a quick reply.   They offered to take care of the problem.  
During the first couple emails I disclosed that the bearings would not allow my axle to fit.   They asked if it was stock and I sent an a image of my axle not fitting through the bearing along with another image of a factory traxxas bearing and the ones I received.  

He asked me in the email what size I needed and I just replied with the bigger ones as I did not know the size yet.  He went ahead and shipped the bearings.    

The bearings I received again were 8x12 but the inner diameter was the exact same as the ones I had.    I sent him an email regarding the size and he sent back an email saying I shouldn't assume stuff and always measure and I costed him $6 more.  

He must have not looked at the two images I included in the email to see the side by side difference.    I decided just to order another 10 traxxas stock 8x12x3.5 bb since I needed them soon and I replied to his email stating I ordered the correct size.    

I slept on and decided to send another email stating I would send him the 8x12 back if I could get 8x12x3.5 in return.    I included another pic of the correct size and the ones he sent.  Just so he could see the difference.   

He sent another email back telling me to read when I sent.   He said that what I'm asking makes no sense and he has been sending the correct bearing.    So he must have not looked at the image I sent (again).  He told me I need to find someone who knows what I need and can help me out and understand.    

So that's why I'm here.  Please help
Me understand what bearings I need for my knuckles and differential.   
Revo 1/16 brushless traxxas

Edit:  
I figured it out.   The bearings they sent were 6x11x4
When I needed 8x12.   So even after I requested 8x12.  They went ahead and sent another set of 6x11x4. 
I should have just measured right away, I just put to much faith in kit.

<TEXT> My first was a HPI Savage Nitro and I picked up a E Revo 1/16 Brushless.   Both were RTR since I was new to the hobby, but I tore both of them down eventually for upgrades and cleaning.   So look into if you want to build or just start driving what's you get the proper gear.   
Brands I think you should check out would be.  

Axial - They have both RTR and KIt and also go for a scale look if you want something to look more realistic.   Something fast and just messing around with you could be looking at the Axial Yeti up to the more scale SCX10.   These guys are more trail riding/rock crawling/ not all out speed(they can be tho with right performance). 

Traxxas/HPI - People bash Traxxas because they are pricey and you don't get what you pay for like other brands, but depending where you love they might be the best brand for upgrade able parts.   Traxxas only has RTR models and they range in price.   They have a variety of vehicles which you should check out.   This might even help you look at other brands and see the same models and compare parts.   Don't feel bad if you go with Traxxas, you will still have a blast. 
Popular models are: Stampede, Slash, Latrax , Summit, Revo, Rustler 

If there is a local hobby store by you check out what they carry.   Also check the internets for forums or community's based on your rc model and brand.  
Watch YouTube vids on ones that interest you.  

Other popular brands that you should definitely check out once you figure out what style rc you want would be:   Team Associated, Losi, OFNA , Tamiya, and there's many more.    
Sites to check out 
www.towerhobbies.com
www.amain.com
www.thetoyz.com


Cheaper brands would be.   Redcat, ECX, Helion, Dromida

<TEXT> I never really built an rc up with aluminum parts.  So I decided to build a Hot Racing 1/16 brushless Revo. 
Along with the HR Im also using RPM arms and traxxas upgrade links and pushrods.  


Other than that I have 2.2 trenchers, but I'm also picking up some on road.  A bluebird servo and fast eddy bearings.    Though I did not receive knuckle bearings that fit my axles, which I'm pretty bummed about.   Also have a custom fitted Spektrum Rx so it would fit in the water resistant case.   GTR shocks with upgraded springs.  Upgraded center dif.  

Still waiting on the baja bug body and 1/12 OFNA wing along with paint and couple other items.    
I am missing a few things but I plan on uploading more pics.   

I'm having shoulder surgery tomorrow though so it will put a halt on the build.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2001 lumina.  White color, spray painted blue over the rust and original white with a final white spray paint.  Added rust and dents to give it that Minnesota feel.  Had it for almost 3 years now.   Even made it the whole time without window washer sprayers.  It's an eye sore and if you drive 65mph for awhile you get the nice smell of coolant and jerky tranny shifts. Otherwise awesome in town car and never get hung up in winter.  

Anyway to answer the question.

<TEXT> Just a heads up I will be disclosing the ending to the movie "Lucy" in the next sentence.    At the end of the movie "Lucy" Scarlett Johansson ends up becoming one with everything around her and finally dissolving into a cell phone or something and talks a little and the credits roll.   Well in the movie "Her" it's Scarlett Johansson who talks and becomes self aware with the Internet.

What happens next is always chaotic from explosions and fires taking out your enemies.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always check eBay auctions.   I'll watch a couple to see if there's a consistency on bids/$.  I will also x-shop amazon and other online retailers.    Pretty easy to figure out a fair yet reasonable price.   

Edit:   Also as for selling in a lot of games or as singles it all depends.   Have a bunch of low title name games (sports games, repeats, ect) sell as a bundle.  
Have big ranking titles like (Final Fantasy III, Chrono Trigger, Mario RPG).   Sell separate.   Have sequel or trilogy titles?   Sell as a set. (Donkey Kong. DK 2, DK3) 

If you go eBay route, combine shipping with different auctions.    This will help your buyers and have them battle for certain games since they are committed on the shipping.   </TEXT>

Do you think Marvel will release a new trailer or somewhat altered trailer for GOTG 2?  Second,  do they figure out who leaks this or does this just get brushed under the rug?   

p.s.  Marvel handled this in a perfect way.   Instantly release a true copy and accept fate.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> After reading everyone's replies I feel as if you don't really need reddit's advice.  
Sounds like you have the mindset to dump school n start working full time, so your husband doesn't have to lose time with his kids.  
  I hope he finds work soon in his field, otherwise he should look into another job or work nights.  Ya it sucks and it messes up your sleep schedule.  Gotta do what ya gotta do!  

Sell that Chevy truck and fix that Saturn up to code.  

$150 is pretty high cell bill especially since only one of you need a "smart phone".  I'd say dump the contact and get the hubby a minute trac phone.   

You need legal advice for non child support payments from your ex.   He is homeless?   Also look into lowering thr garnishing wages on your husband child support.  

I'm really sorry for your situation and with strength and motivation you will get out of it.   You guys need to make the sacrifices now otherwise you'll be stuck forever.  

Hoping there will be a hand out from someone to get you out of this rut will probably not happen.  

Time to stand up for the kids!   Are you delivering papers for $500/month?   </TEXT>

My father bought me a Bmx that was pretty costly for my rents income.  


Anyway bike was stolen n my dad went to all the pawn shops with the bikes serial number.    He was told if it showed up we would be notified.   

My bike showed up and ended up being sold to someone I know.    Whose family was a lot less fortunate than us.  
My dad let the kid keep the bike and he cried tears of joy because of that.

<TEXT> So true.   My friend was in a pretty popular punk band and they were on there last tour.  During their concert I was getting drinks for them and walking them back stage as they performed.  The security guy out of no where grabs me on my 3rd pass and tells me I can no longer walk anywhere.  Even when the show was done I could not stay with the band.   Even some of the members would be playing and walk over to the security guy and I next to the stage and ask what the hell was going on.   

I never really hold grudges, but the ego tripping security guard in MN was a complete d-bag.

<TEXT> I have a 2006 Acura TL where the power windows, reverse lights, blinkers,sunroof, gauge cluster and lights are not working.  

I checked all fuses (meter) and relays and everything looks and test fine.  I cannot roll the windows down with the switch inside the car, but if I do the key in the door I can get all windows/sunroof to roll up and down.  

The blinkers do not work but the hazard button still does.  

Any ideas? </TEXT>

When you jump you would basically touch the ground and the flimsy trampoline would fight to make you bounce.

<TEXT> Similar story, when I was a wee lad I received one of those earth day baby pine trees.   I planted it right away in my parents from lawn right by this rock, so it wouldn't get mowed over.    

Flash forward  12 years, it was 2008 and my parents house was foreclosed on.   It all happened so fast, but we ended moving 20+years of stuff to a rental.    

One thing I did leave was that tree I planted.    It was a little bigger than myself.   

Time goes by and new ppl have moved into our home and I just try and forget about the whole situation.   Until one day I was going to show my new gf the house.    I told her all about that tree and what it meant to me and I was excited to see hoe much it grew.     Well, the new homeowners cut the bastard down.  

Was a sad day that my tree had to leave.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's true.   I don't play soccer, but would play catch with friends.   Anyway one summer day my younger sister was tormenting me while playing soccer with a friend.    

She would run up and throw water or whatever she could find at us and run back up our grassy hill to the pavement steps before entering the wooden door.  

Finally I was fed up after she just soaked me from a glass of water.    On her retreat just as she was making her way to the peak of the grassy hill, I kicked the ball towards the house.     The ball was in flight until it hit the side of the hill and started speed rolling right towards her feet.    She took 1 step before that ball went between her legs, and on her opposite leg swing her ankles hugged the ball and her knees buckled.  Slamming her to concrete from a full sprint as the water glass hit the wooden door.  

It was awesome  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Serious question and all respect to this guy (rip). 

But does anyone know or have records of what this guy was earning on these peelers and how he had distribution rights?   Or can you buy them online?  

Has anyone ever used one over the years?

<TEXT> I love you and I need to tell my scary moment.  

I was in 10nth grade and went to Mexico for 10 days for my Spanish class.   Anyway one destination was Playa de Carmen?   If I remember correctly.    The class was looking for something to do when we stumbled upon snorkeling.    We all had to pay and watch a quick tutorial on the Do's n Don'ts.     We took boats out to our location of course and the whole class jumped in (20+).    We were rushed on this whole situation cause a storm was coming in and no one wanted to go thru the process of getting refunded.       

Anyway a girl n I were swimming around a pretty neat spot with coral
Reef just a couple feet under us.      Which was scary cause the waves started pulling me down into the reefs and u learned you didn't want to touch them.       

The waves started increasing in size and rain started to pour.      I took a quick glance up while trying to float myself away from the reefs to see the whole class dispersed amongst the water.        It got pretty sketchy quick when lighting and thunder arrived along with a heavy down pour.     With the waves increasing I kept getting hurled to the coral reefs that were inches underneath me.   I kept my head under to make sure I could get out of this clearing and not get hurt.    As soon as I made it out I looked up and couldn't see any of my classmates nor any of the boats.   I could barely even make out where the beach was.    
This is when I went into complete panic mode and started swimming frantically to
Just a dot in my vision.    As I swam and swam
All I could think about was drowning or getting washed out to sea.    I finally made it close to a boat and started yelling.     Turns out the boat I swam to was not a tourist boat but a couple Mexicans just doing their thing.    They helped me on and brought me to land.    

The teacher started doing head counts after that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I got a similar  text when I started college in 2008 except I had a cat. And that cat didn't miss me either she was just ratting me out.   

This is what happened:

In my room I had a old TV stand that had about 1/2 of clearing from the carpet to the base.  Well young me used to keep everything under there.   Cigs-Porn-Condoms-Pot and anything else you can think of that a teenage boy would horde from his parents.   9-12th grade I was keeping items under here.

Now I moved away and completely forgot about my hidden stash, since I only lived an hour away my parents kept my room the same, so I would have a place to crash.  

Well about 2 weeks after I moved I guess my cat went into my room and started pawing at everything under the tv stand.   Parents came into the room and saw couple cigs and edge of a mag.  

Got an awesome call that day!


Thanks cat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should of been more clear on this.   This is for only walk-ins I will do this.  We usually have a full day of schedule appt, but you get a couple walk-ins and most will set up a next day appt.   Some customers are either out of town or just can't get an appt set up.  These are the customer that will do a quick (15-30min) inspection.   Everyone should be charged the min, but I gift the nice patient ones.

<TEXT> Yes-  I work in an audio shop that does installs of all sorts.   We also troubleshoot a lot of oem products that come standard on most cars, common case is a factory radio.  
People will just swing in and state their problem with the factory tuner.  Mostly it just doesnt work, nothing coming out of the speakers and so forth.  

I hardly charge for this, if we don't find a problem or can't help you in the right direction to solve the issue.   There is some cases tho where I will charge the lowest labor charge I can.   These cases usually involve a customer that is rude either before check-out or during.   Usually goes like this

Me-  "Sir, we went thru the radio checked all connections and fuses.  We couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, but I believe the radio could be shot internally."

Customer- "Well there better not be a charge, if you didn't fix anything.  Now I have to bring it to another shop to waste more of my time."

Me-  "Sir, I will have to charge you the min labor fee for having the car looked at."

*Customer throws a fit*

Now if you don't want to be charged, this is the response I'm looking for

Me- "Sir, we went thru the radio checked all connections and fuses.  We couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, but I believe the radio could be shot internally."


Customer- "That's unfortunate.   Anyway, what do I owe ya?!'

Me- " Oh, nothing but I recommend this [Dealership] or [junkyard] for a factory radio replacement."

<TEXT> vist:  metraonline.com   or    bestkits.com    to check what you will need
-Dash kit- Harness - Antenna Adapt-

Next find what you are looking for in a radio.   If you need just CD-USB-AUX - you can find radios for right around or less $100  for example heres a good radio

http://www.crutchfield.com/p_113KDC155U/Kenwood-KDC-155U.html?showAll=N search=kdc_155u skipvs=T

Now for speakers!  
The jeep should have 5.25 all around. 
You are not limited to that size tho.   You can place 5.25 -  6.0 - 6.5 
just needs adapters.

Now, since you have so many options this is where you will have to do some research.   
I deal with JL Audio and RE audio and love both brands, but worked with  a lot of other companies

1. [High End](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_136TR600CX/JL-Audio-TR600-CXi.html?tp=105)

2. [Low End](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_500SPS510/Alpine-SPS-510.html?tp=105)

This should keep you right around the $400 price point without install of course.

One night my friends and I were drunk and went to this place and I ended up blowing a bunch of money for these tickets.  I'm a 1000 short from a Sniper Rifle Nerf gun that I was aiming for.   Anyway if this is in fact Adventure Zone.   I will mail you the 6000 tickets.   

If not adventure zone,  I will be going back there to win 1k more tickets to get that gun.   </TEXT>

Turns out her ex bf was friend with my ex's new bf.    My gf went over to their apartment saw the ring on my ex n told her former bf she really liked it.    He bought it for their anniversary.     

TL:DR bought ex a ring new gf has same ring which she got the idea from my ex.    </TEXT>

Anyway last Saturday night my friends and I were outside a bar having a cig and a homeless guy walked up to us and asked for a cig.  My friends kinda ignored him and I just flat out offered him my pack with the lighter.   He started tearing up and he thanked me as if I saved him from his poverty life.  It gave me such a weird feeling overall.  I mean those won't help him in life, but even hurt him more.   It just confused me.  :( I hope he's ok.     </TEXT>

Next you would grab a squeeek toy and squeeze the shit out of it making that god awful noise.   This would drive the ferret crazy which would lead to biting and burrowing.

3.  Climbing out of the lake using a ladder to get on the dock (dislocated shoulder)
4. Eating a girl out and she moves her leg to quick (dislocated shoulder)
5.  Reaching to the top cabinet at my apartment (dislocated shoulder)

There is a lot more and always explaining to the ER nurses always comes with laughs and tears (from me) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the replies!  When we first moved in it was not bubbling, but after awhile bother apartments started bubbling in both spots.  I pointed it out to my landlord awhile ago on a mid term inspection.   I would fix it myself even since it would cost about $50.00 and my labor.   Which is better then $400.00.  I will call them again or the mangement team for complex.   

I just didn't know if there was any loop holes to this. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in an apartment complex.  It has 7 total apartments.  4 of them were redone including mine and a friends that lived next door.  The friend actually moved out last week and while we were moving a tv stand it clipped this linoleum flooring and tore it.   It's only in the entry way.  Anyway where it caught the flooring was because the flooring was actually bubbling up.  They barely put glue down it seems like.  Underneath is another linoleum flooring, but seems to be glued down a lot better.  It's just really beat up.  

The flooring in my apartment is also bubbling like it was in my friends apartment.  I contacted the landlord a couple times but no response.  

Am I screwed on the damage deposit?  I can upload pics for a better idea too.

<TEXT> His name is Flip.  Maybe it's a her, they never really disclose during the show.  The character was introduced in the late early/mid 2000's.  The producer of show the felt they needed a character that the more "special kids" could feel apart of the show.  This was the last ditch effort the big wigs would try to save the show.   So far, the ratings of the show have increased enough to keep it aired.  They should pull through for more seasons.  The real news is who plays the character "Flip", none other than the infamous graffiti artist, Banksy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you, AgeMarkus and Linkrobin know each other?  I went through Linkrobin's comments and saw that you would confront them on the repost.  Linkrobin just denies it in a funny niave way.  It was all pretty funny.   Fill me in on your story.

edit: The kicker is that robin  calls out everyone for reposting </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like this game has a great concept.  I think a nice layout of the HUD would make this game stand out over other FPS genres.  Plus with multiplayer, possibilities of game types and tweaks are limitless. 

If there is a game already like this or in the making, please let me know! 

 Note:  I'll expand more on this once I know this already doesn't exist. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reddit, do you have any weird habits you start doing whenever anxiety, stress or deep thought kick in? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-24 21:09:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have two habits, one I do more frequently than the other, whenever I am under those stages. The one I do the most is I put my backhand up to my face, so my knuckles are barely touching my lips. I than proceed to move my hand up and down so my lips hit each knuckle. I have no idea why I do this, but I been doing it since toddler I guess. The second, is that I take my thumb and pointer finger and gently rub my earlobe with my thumbnail ( --that could be wrong ) while applying pressure with my pointer. 

Both of these habits really soothes me I guess? I become relaxed and feel focused while doing one or another. What about you reddit? 

Do you have any strange habits? </TEXT>
