<TEXT> They would want to get the knife away from him. If he won't out the knife down, they must do it themselves. Tazer could work but if ineffective then he slices his own throat of still has a knife. Try to take it with your bare hands and he will kill himself or turn the knife in officers. Shooting is the only sure way to get the knife away if he won't cooperate. 
If she didn't call the cops he still could've sliced his throat and no one would be there to stop bleeding which would only even be possible if it wasnt arterial bleeding. 
Calling the cops was the only real chance the guy had. She regrets it because she blames cops for the death. If he would've been cooperative or not suicidal then he would be alive. It's a coping mechanism of grief to blame someone other than the deceased.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Progress] 6'4'' 155-180=+25lbs in 4 months </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-17 22:42:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First progress post. I lifted all of high school, on and off in college before getting religious about gaining in March

 [starting at 155] (http://imgur.com/Q1qxla9) and [Current at 180] (http://imgur.com/rUE6NZo)
6'4'' male, 22yo. 

Diet- eating anything I can, I haven't been counting calories. I stopped using protein shakes as I noticed I wouldn't eat much for a few hours after and started drinking 3 glasses of chocolate milk a day. For meat I have been doing chicken and pork, both are fairly cheap and I work them into various dishes. I'm aware I've probably gained a good amount of fat but I'm not worried about that yet since I was so underweight and don't have a gut yet. 

Lifting- squat and bench on 3x5, 3x3, 5-3-1 with warm up sets at bar and one plate each side. Curls, pull downs, single leg deadlift, calf raises, tricep extension, shrugs, lunges, all at 3x10.

main lifting improvements

bench- 180 max to 240 max

squat- 200 max to 250 max </TEXT>

<TEXT> EMT here. Cops don't need medical training beyond first aid/CPR. They already fuck up the little medical training they have. Their job isn't to make medical judgement, that's our job. Just like why firefighters cut people out of cars, not cops, there's a places for everyone in the system. Mess with who does what and it's a disaster. 
There's literally nothing the cops could do for a seizure. Seizures require drugs that paramedics attend years of schooling in order to gain a license to give the drugs. Best case scenario for a seizure in a crowd- move patient out from the crowd if it is safe to do so, have Medics show up, Medics treat/transport
On a side note, if you witness seizure, time how long it is and move things out of the way so the person doesn't get hurt.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Preview: Beau Gamble, a former walk-on at Colorado, put together this alumni team to band together different eras of Buffaloes basketball. Gamble was able to get at least two alums at each position, including small forward Richard Roby, the programs all-time leading scorer. Colorado should have 9+ players in LA for the first weekend, and with all coming from the same system, itll end up being a tough out for Team 23.

<TEXT> Completely unbiased here. 
The Nebraska common opponent doesn't work here. CU played in Lincoln, GT played neutral field. 
I'll keep my overall argument simple, all voters knew about the 5th down and clipping call. That is the biggest arguments against Colorado but don't hold much ground when voters knew about it. Colorado only lost the coaches poll by 1 vote. They won the AP by very many votes. Colorado had a harder SOS as many other people here will discuss. If we emphasize conference play then Colorado wins at a perfect record where as GT tied North Carolina. 

Edit- for SOS Colorado played 7 rated opponents to GT's 3.  </TEXT>

We have 4-5 games decided by one possession.

Milwaukee and Wisconsin have a choice, build a new stadium to keep the bucks, possibly get an NHL team, and modernize Milwaukee.

A new stadium would do nothing but good for Milwaukee. Everyone is way too focused on the bucks. It's ok to fund a baseball stadium for a shitty team but funding a facility for diverse entertainment is a no go.

<TEXT> Must be an old review for Colorado, they brought back beer gardens last year. This year we have a brand new rooftop terrace on top of the new addition. 
[Tickets to the rooftop sold out in hours] (http://bsndenver.com/around-the-herd-7715-shouting-from-the-rooftop/) 

I was hoping the review would be something more along the lines of it being hard to breathe, and not because of excitement 

Edit- not a one star review but I enjoyed this one

Only 23 percent had a documented psychiatric history of any kindwhich means three out of four did not.] (http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/actually-know-connections-mental-illness-mass-shootings-gun-violence-83103).

<TEXT> Yeah our men's club could easily make the jump. I'm not saying they would be an immediate power house, but they could compete. They won nationals in 2014, lost in the final last season. Women's moved to d1 via title ix and do decently but were a shitty club team beforehand. We have everything in place for it to happen, they just need to navigate title ix restrictions. A rivalry would easily form between CU and DU. 

The Denver outlaws pro team won a title recently, DU won ncaa, Colorado and CSU have recent club titles, ncaa regional was in Denver, world games were here last year. It's getting big in Colorado  </TEXT>

You should look into mini packs. It's $77 for 3 games but you could get better seats if you pay a bit more money. I highly recommend going to the Rocky Mountain Showdown. It isn't a huge crowd but there is plenty of hate to go around, especially with recent years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you in the Boulder area? Those tickets will be "harder" to come by. I say harder because season ticket holders and students won't be giving up their tickets, USC has a huge alumni base in Colorado, and Oregon has random fans everywhere. 
Best advice, don't get tickets in the visitors area, those are the worst seats in the stadium. I would just go to the Folsom box office web page and buy tickets before season starts. Sure you could get some scalped tickets a few days before the game but the could be more expensive.  </TEXT>

Before I get downvoted to the depths of hell, who wants to place a wager? If Sanders wins the primary, I'll donate $25 (I'm a broke college student and Sanders likes small donations) to his campaign. If he doesn't make it, $25 will be donated to the GOP that wins the primary by whoever takes me up on this. 

Edit- wow I would've expected someone to take me up on this by now. I guess Sanders supporters aren't as confident as they appear  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing about academics? 
I think they were generous on basketball. CSU lost the best players from last year if I remember correctly and that year was an outlier. They complain about being snubbed and then lose in the first NIT round. That's just poor attitude. Colorado was snubbed a few years ago then  lost in the NIT semis. To prevent being snubbed they won the pac tournament the following year. 
Geography gave me a laugh. Yes Colorado boarders a big 12 state and used to be a big 12 state, but it's not any easy drive. It's 8 hours of boring flat land from Kansas. I think CU BIG 12 history is the only reason geography was scored so high.  </TEXT>

I believe I saw somewhere that the facility would also use a feedback loop for climate control, possibly with Folsom field. I've having issues finding it

<TEXT> "indoor practice facility is partnering with SunPower to install a 55,000 square foot solar panel array that will generate 850kW of electricity.  Almost half of the roof will be covered with solar panels allowing it to be a net-zero electricity facility, meaning it creates more energy than it consumes. There will even be a live dashboard that will display how much energy is being produced, and other information about the panels on the roof mounted in the facility."
[source](http://bsndenver.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-the-new-cu-facilities-part-1/). 
The climate control will be by evaportive coolers. These use 1/8th the power of air conditioning. They can be used in Boulder because of the area's low humidity. 

Edit- apparently there's a neighborhood in Boulder that is zero energy, from 2009

I really hope they manage to keep the field house but I guess they won't need it if they can put a floor down in the practice facility for non-football events. Expanding the concourse on coors has also been in discussion, I don't see how they do that with the little room to expand outside.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Colorado Construction Update- Leading the Nation in Innovation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-23 20:35:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought I would try writing my own type of construction update as I pass by the facilities daily. 

Construction updates are all over /r/cfb so what makes this one unique? Green innovation. 
The solar panels on the indoor practice facility have started being placed. The skeleton of the structure is viewable on the [construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799). So why do solar panels matter? They matter because the [indoor practice facility](http://www.cusustainableexcellence.com/ipf.html), 110,000 square feet, will be the only self-sustaining indoor practice facility in the country. 

This isn't the first CU athletic facility to lead the nation in a green initiative, Folsom Field became the [first zero waste stadium in 2008] (http://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/zero-waste-football-games). This is all part of [Ralphie's Green Stampede] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1549812) that consists of many eco-friendly initiatives to keep CU as one of the greenest and most innovative universities. 

The setting of CU on the edge of the Rocky Mountains is a constant reminder of why CU leads the way in building a more sustainable future.  The new facilities will also lead Colorado football into a brighter future, with sustained success to rival that of the 90's. After all, if you build it, they will come. Well, 3 people are coming so far....  </TEXT>

<TITLE> why I stopped using protein/mass powders </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-11 01:55:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had been using protein shake mixes for years on and off without much gaining. It finally hit me one day that I wouldn't eat for hours after having a shake, they made me feel too full and slightly nauseous. I instead started using preworkout and creatine only, I had used them with shakes beforehand. I drink 3-4 glasses of chocolate milk each day, two immediately after a workout. I noticed I was eating more and now have gained  20 lbs since giving up protein shakes a few months ago. I'm not sure why I'm posting this except to tell anyone who gets irritation from shakes to try something else. There's no universal meal plan for gainers, just meet you calorie goal and eat "healthy" foods.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know nothing about the process of adding intramural sports but is anyone interested in intramural lacrosse? I'm guessing the only way to make it happen would be playing no-contact or possibly using women's sticks and rules. Liability comes with physicality. The school has the lacrosse field and goals. Participants would likely need their own equipment. The only real cost to the school would be more refs. 
If anyone knows more about the process or works with the rec center it would be great to get the ball rolling. Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport and Colorado could become the lacrosse capital of the West since the outlaws professional team is good and DU won nationals.  </TEXT>

[Fly through] (https://vimeo.com/91724467)

Construction of a 120,000-square-foot indoor multipurpose practice facility on top of Franklin Field, to include a 100-yard artificial turf football field and six-lane 300-meter track;
Refurbishment of the Dal Ward Athletics Center, completed in 1991, to include an Olympic sports strength training room in the sub-basement level and new locker rooms and equipment room on the field level;
Redesigning of Dal Ward's first floor for the expansion of Olympic sports/sports medicine, a leadership development center and an end zone club with club seating and loge boxes;
Transforming the second floor of Dal Ward to triple the athletic department's academic support system from its current 5,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet;
Building additional restrooms and concession areas on the east side of Folsom Field; and
Adding a 21,900-square foot high-performance sports center on the northeast corner of the stadium, as well as a rooftop terrace on the northeast corner, converting the south offices at Folsom Field to retail space. The rooftop terrace will generate revenue by being available for rent for non-game-day events. The high-performance sports center will host collaborative research conducted by CU-Boulder Integrative Physiology faculty and researchers at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> CU is hosting its first field day tomorrow. Students can play yard games or compete against football players in skills stations such as throwing, kicking, catching, 40 yard dash etc. As a student I'm looking forward to it and was wondering if other schools do this. Specifically with CU, its a great way for the program to branch out to the students who have formed some hostility for the program.  </TEXT>

I cannot do both because of when classes are available and I am graduating in the fall. I want to get a job in health administration and possibly continue on to graduate school for a MHA. Which path above should I take? My major is in physiology which isn't direclty applicable  to Health administration but I do know some people who landed jobs with similar majors.  </TEXT>

The link guides you through how to make a geofilter for snapchat. Boulder has one (I'm not a fan of it),  but CU does not have one. While some off you don't use snapchat, some of you enjoy graphic design. Depending on how many people submit something, I may give out reddit gifts/gold. 
Ideas you may consider- notable buildings, Ralphie, the Flatirons, scenic area, or any design you can come up with.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What happened to night skiing at Eldora? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-12 22:55:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently found out Eldora used to have night skiing but haven't seen anything on why they no longer offer it. Below is a night trail map. I'm guessing it had to do with forest service, night traffic on the canyon, or not being profitable. I've night skied at Keystone and it was empty but  I figure night skiing would do better at Eldora since it's so close to Boulder.

<TEXT> Title says it all. Yes it is more basketball relevant but we're at the time where  other sports overlap. I wanted to post here to keep things a bit civil versus r/cfb and r/collegebasketball people yelling at Eachother. 

Has the UNC scandal changed your view on players receiving payment?

Personally I would be for taking for away scholarships and paying players under $100k. I'm not in favor of more successful schools getting to pay more money, then they just keep buying more talent and competition is gone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will have the epic local college pass but because of my schedule I won't get out to summit as often as I'd like (enough for the pass to be worth the money). I'm also considering the Elodora college pass ($159) since it's closer to Boulder. 

 I've never been to Eldora and know it's smaller but the bus from Boulder is a great appeal. I saw it's added to the WP/Copper pass which will add to the crowds. 

Would it be worth getting the pass for days that I can't make it to summit? Is the terrain/snow as bad as they say?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> remounting (third total mount) skis </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-14 00:26:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a pair of 2012/13 liberty helixes. I bought them used and they had a demo binding on them (removed before I bought them). I was able to center mount them and rode them 3x before season end. I am considering remounting them to cab forward. I had salomon suspects for 5 years before this pair and had those center mounted as well. On the helix i was having difficulty staying afloat in the powder and initiating turns on groomers. I'm not sure if this is from not being used to the ski or if i should move my binding to cab forward. 
so should i try moving them knowing that once i do they are stuck there for good, and how should they hold up with 3 binding mounts done?

i tried finding a ski gear subreddit and the best was wintergear with no activity, if this should be in a different subreddit i will happily move it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Gilbert white memorial flood maker next to Boulder Creek at Broadway. I have been searching for good pictures of the marker with the flood waters, kind of like a snow stick at ski resorts. I have only found pictures with the marker when flood waters have receded. Does anyone know of any good ones?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> 17 yo Leukemia Patient gives to other hospitalized children </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-22 06:38:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know this girl personally and her charity has really taken off recently. I know she would love some more support. Here is the description written by her--

Hi! My name is Emma Rose. I am a 17 year old Leukemia (ALL) patient. I was diagnosed with cancer in January, 2012. It has been a tough year, but I am finally feeling better. I am in the maintenance phase of my treatment. Even though this is the "easiest" part of my treatment, it still consists of daily oral chemo and almost monthly spinal taps until May 2014. Since my diagnosis, so many people have helped my family and me in many ways. Now, I want to do something to give back. I want to help other kids with cancer who are also being treated at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.  We collect comfort items the kids can use during their stay- especially pillow pets, soft blankets, fuzzy socks, iTune gift cards, ear buds, packs of gum, leggo kits, nail polish, glow sticks, and crayons. Our newest Wishlists are on Amazon. If interested in donating gifts to help the Kids at Children's WI, please go to Amazon, click on Wish Lists and then search for Emma Rose. We just completed a major donation drive called "Movie Night". Thanks to the generosity of our followers and WE Energies' donation of 100 copies of Honor Flight- The Movie, we were able to put together 100 movie tubs for the kids. Each tub contained several movies, popcorn, candy and other items for the children and their families. The tubs were given to the children on the HOT Unit, in MACC Clinic, in the BMT Clinic and at Ronald McDonald House. Since the children cannot go to the movie theater, I wanted to bring the movie theater experience to them. Thank you so much! Please make sure all donations are new and in their original packages. All mail and packages can be sent to Emma Rose, PO Box 485, Thiensville, WI 53092. Thank you so much for your generosity!  Emma Rose </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why people hate the Heat </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-07 19:13:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now I already expect to get down votes shoved up my ass for this thread but I dont care because my life doesnt revolve around reddit karma. 
Before you downvote and click back without reading, read a bit of this. 
Why do people hate the Miami Heat? The answer- they all jumped on the hate train. 
1. Heat fans are bandwagon fans. Id like to argue that its cooler to hate the heat than like them. So by hating, you joined that band wagon. I became a Heat fan when they drafted Wade. I watched Wade a season ticket holder for Marquette. I never cared for the bucks because they never caught my interest. You dont have to be a fan of your local team, everyone has their reasons for liking a team. I was a fan before Lebron and the Big 3 yet everyone assumes Im a fan because of Lebron. Wade won Miami's first title in 2006.
Before someone says "Jimmy Butler played for Marq, shouldnt you be a bulls fan? No. While I love to see how well he is doing, Wade is still my favorite Marq player. Not just because of skill, but how he is off the court. Read up on his divorce and life with his sons.

2. "Lebron is a traitor/sellout"- Cleveland didnt have a chance of a title in the near future so Lebron went somewhere he could win. So what? Every player in the NBA wants to win a title. Its a lifelong dream for professional athletes. If your a Cleveland fan who hates lebron, you should be hating the management for not building a better team before lebron left. I dont mean a team around lebron or a superstar team, just a better team. 

3. The heat are a superstar team. So what? Part of basketball is trying to build a great team that will build a franchise. When you play pick up games you choose the best players first dont you? Do you all hate the Jordan era bulls? 

4. Bosh is a dinosaur. I dont mind people saying this. Its true and the memes are funny. Thats no reason to hate a player though. There are plenty of uglier players. 

5. Lebron is compared to Jordan. Thats the standerd for basketball, everyone is looking for the next jordan. Lebron has MVPs and Olympic Medals. He doesnt have the rings but look at his past. Cleveland had no chance. He made the finals his first year with the heat, won the finals the second year, had a 27 game winning streak the 3rd year. He is a damn good player. He is not Jordan. Having him compared to jordan is not a reason to hate him. NBA analyst will always compare great players to Jordan. Kobe gets compared. I dont hate Kobe for that or for being a great player. I dislike him because he has a record for being a selfish asshole who was accused of rape.... (Tosh.0 anyone?)

I'm not saying theres no reason to hate the Heat. Im just saying you should have your reasons and be able to back them up. My reasons listed arent perfect but they are a start. There are reasons to hate Miami, but be able to back yourself up so you arent just another person riding the hate train.

<TEXT> What if Rose has not returned because the NBA secretly made him wait until the Bulls v Heat series.
Im not saying this is true or possible, just a thought that sort of fits. 
1. Heat beat bulls for a couple games, but not by a lot. 
2. Rose returns in game 3 or 4
3. Refs influence game or everything just seems to go against Miami
4. Rose and the Bulls take the next games needed to win the series
5. Bulls Heat rivalry heats up
6. Lebron leaves Miami
