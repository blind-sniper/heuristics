<TEXT> I'm way late to this, but my assistant manager at a place I worked at a few years ago came very close to having a heart attack, luckily they caught the blockage in time to do a triple bypass. 

Now, his insurance was very good so out of pocket he only had to pay like $8,000 or so, but he got an itemized bill from the hospital, and there were some absolutely ridiculous charges on there... one that immediately springs to mind was $300 some odd dollars for administering baby aspirin (like $30 per pill). 

I literally almost shit my pants looking at that bill. It was insane. The total amount, had he not had insurance, would have exceeded $500,000. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nicotine. 

I've tried quitting cold turkey.

I've tried switching to chew figuring at least I'd be eliminating second hand smoke. 

I've tried the patch. 

I've tried gum. 

I've tried vaping. 

I've tried 3 different prescription medications to aid with quitting smoking. 

The worst part is that my life only gets more stressful which only worsens my smoking habit. 

One day I will successfully quit.

Edit: I've also tried to pinpoint stressors in my life to avoid to help control cravings during attempts, and finding healthy things to get "addicted" to that I can do during nasty cravings. 

Also, yes reddit, I know, I should never have started smoking in the first place. Thank you, hindsight is 20/20, unfortunately it's also 100% useless. 

No, I don't recall precisely why I started smoking. Boredom and wanting to feel more grown up I suppose. </TEXT>

If they ask "Would you mind?" and you say "I'd rather you didn't" and they ask again "It'll only take a second and it'll help clear things up" they likely don't have enough probable cause or a warrant and you can hold your ground with your "No." perfectly legally.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imgur

 The company was started inAthens, Ohioas Alan Schaaf's side project as he attendedOhio Universityforcomputer science. The service, which the creator describes as "an image hosting service that doesn't suck", was created as a response to the usability problems encountered in similar services. Originally designed as a gift to the online community ofReddit,[9]it took off almost instantly, jumping from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views in the first five months.[10]The website became widely recognized following its rise to popularity onsocial newswebsites such asRedditandDigg.[11]

Can't find the link, but before he officially started it he did state on reddit that he was going to create an image hosting site that didn't suck.


He definitely delivered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never been kicked out of an actual physical real world place so I'll tell you about the time I was banned from a subreddit.

I was banned from /r/creepypms for "victim shaming" by pointing out that when someone initiates a conversation in a blatantly creepy fashion on a random chat app, and despite the giant "BLOCK USER" button, and the giant "END CHAT" button, *and* the giant "REPORT USER" button, you chose to continue conversing with said obvious creep for 45 minutes feigning offense, you're no longer a "victim". You're and amused person seeing how far this will go for extra karma on reddit.

Might also wanna point out that the comment section was full of people saying things like "oh my goodness! I'm so sorry you had to deal with that OP. *Hugz.* I hope your day gets better."

Wtf, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. OP could very easily have ended the chat immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had 1-3 cats pretty much my entire life. 

First of all, the kid is barely even touching the cat, and that's one way cats play with each other, by slapping each other, only harder than that kid was doing it and with claws that sometimes aren't completely tucked away. 

Second of all, the cat is showing zero signs of anger, irritation or aggression. He's showing signs of a cat in "play feral mode" waiting for the opportune moment to playfully strike back, which he did. This is likely why the person filming did nothing, this is probably a common occurrence between this boy and his cat. 

TLDR; Nothing went wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gas station cashier here.

They're not super common, no. On average I do about 400-500 transactions in an 8 hour shift (big city, busy area, and a drive thru) and I see probably 3 checks a day on average. It royally irritates me because it's **literally** the same thing as using your debit card, only it takes 2 minutes instead of 2 seconds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's actually not my problem at all .

I can absolutely deny your $100 bill because I can't break it and there isn't one thing you can do about it, aside from go elsewhere. 

If you're polite I will apologize and sincerely mean it. If you're an ass I'll be an ass too. 

Good luck finding a gas station that at midnight can comfortably break a 100 dollar bill. Gas stations are prime targets for robberies especially in the middle of the night. We drop our till down to $100 or less on a regular basis.

Of course you wouldn't know this if you come from a town of 2000 people. Welcome to the vast majority of the population of the world.

Cheers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up with a guy that lied constantly about the dumbest shit. Everyone knew he was full of it and the list could go on for days about the stories he made up but two stick out in my mind as particularly ridiculous. 

1. He insisted when we were about 16 that his uncle invented facebook and sold the concept for $2M but was never paid due to a legal technicality. He maintained this lie for probably 3 years before insisting he was "just joking".

2. He told us he was born in Mexico to high ranking cartel members and shot 3 times at age 5 before being put in witness protection and adopted by US citizens. He could not reveal the bullet wound scars because they were surgically removed to protect his identity and the cartel was still looking for him. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The district attorneys office declined to file charges against the officers. Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosa Alarcon wrote in a memo about the shooting that Diaz Zeferinos right hand was no longer visible from the officers angle and that it was reasonable for them to believe he was going to reach for a weapon.

This shit needs to stop. This kind of answer is such a common one size fits all answer in regards to unwarranted police shootings, and it seems to fly an alarming majority of the time. 

Basically the translation is "Well cops have a dangerous job, they made a split second decision that was well within their rights to make, so no ones getting in trouble."

I'm fucking sorry, but 3 cops shooting someone 8 times point blank where there was no weapon is absolutely unacceptable.

Due to the miscommunication with the dispatcher who mistakenly reported it as a robbery (dispatch here is also very much at fault....) guns trained is understandable. But what it escalated to was absolutely not. 

We absolutely need to find a peaceful solution to this type of thing. Police need to stop being able to hide behind their badges and the authority to make tough decisions and be held fucking accountable for their actions. </TEXT>

I took swimming lessons at age 7 initially because it was required of me for a summer program I was in and all that really served to do was improve my technique. I'm certainly no Olympic swimmer, don't get me wrong, but I honestly can't recall a time where swimming was ever difficult for me, it always came naturally and I've grown up around water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Motorola Droid Mini is a fairly budget phone and pretty decent. 

LG has made some decent budget phones in the past. 

Samsung's older phones such as the S4 are getting to the budget price range and are still good. 

You should check out MKBHD on YouTube. His reviews on smart devices are really good. Short, to the point, accurate and amusing.

Personally, I would say most budget type phones aren't worth it unless you really need a replacement and it's all you can afford. They aren't *that* much cheaper than a better phone. </TEXT>

That its okay for a woman to fly off the handle and verbally abuse a man, sometimes even physically. Call names, shout, throw things, push or even punch. But if the guy retaliates at all suddenly he's the fucking spawn of Satan and deserves to be carted off to jail. 

That its okay for women to ogle men and drool over his stunning manly features, but if a guy gets caught sheepishly glancing at a nice ass or chest he's a pig objectifying women. 

That its okay for women to call people "sweetie" or "dear" or "baby" (that last one is definitely regional, more common in the south) or other such things in a perceived to be endearing motherly way, but a man would be written up, suspended or even fired from work if he tried to do that. *To clarify I have no desire to do this, but I find it uncomfortable when females do this to me and wish it was the same universally.*

That it's okay to publicly "show concern" for someone who appears to be too thin, or joke about it and ask if they ever eat anything, or say a strong gust of wind would blow them away. Try the same thing with someone who's overweight. "Haha, do you ever stop eating? JK LMAO!". "You're so heavy it might take a forklift to move you! Haha!". </TEXT>

Also the "heat". As soon as it hits like 73 degrees people are acting like we're in an inferno. 9 months out of the year in Houston 73 is a rather cool night, temps hitting 95-110 by 10am every day for the majority of the year. I don't go into that much detail with the average complainer of heat but I do laugh and say I think it's nice out, but then again I'm from Houston. So they respond with "YEAH BUT THAT'S *DRY* HEAT!". Funny, cause Houston is only an hour (with traffic) from the Gulf, prone to tropical storms, hurricanes and very high humidity. 

Anywho, I got a kick outta the pic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever tried to become addicted to a carrot? They're awful. 

First of all, that's an opinion. Some people rather enjoy carrots. 

I don't subscribe nor do I think the scientific community subscribes to the idea that you can become addicted to anything. 

Well, your carrot example was sort of a reduced and exaggerated one. Is a person likely to become addicted to carrots specifically even if they like them? No. But they could easily become addicted to the idea of eating healthy, for example, and overdo it to an unhealthy point. Things aren't black and white usually. 


I agree, most addiction comes from reinforcing behavior through reward systems. Let me rephrase. 

Anything a person can do multiple times over an extended period of time, that *that particular individual finds to be satisfying* yet not satisfying enough to ever be completely satisfied, can become psychologically addictive. Video games, working out, biting nails, smoking weed, masturbation, cleaning their living space, throwing a ball into a cup, *throwing up* etc. You get the picture. There are obvious exceptions, such as suicide for example. Not much chance of becoming addicted to committing suicide. 

Are you familiar with OCD? I have OCD. I also have a generally addictive personality. I've become psychologically dependant on numerous things throughout my life, and some make more sense than others, but they're all similar in one aspect: I find it to be satisfying, but never satisfied enough to call it quits, and I am able to repeat it over a lengthy period of time. An obsessive behavior or thought process associated with OCD is remarkably similar to becoming addicted to say, playing WoW. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this question is oddly right up my alley at this moment in time... 

I actually just had ana sex for the first time with my girlfriend last night *very briefly I might add* it was her first time too. 

It was easier than I think we both thought it'd be to get it started, but by no means could I have "accidentally" fully penetrated her anus. I have drunkenly fumbled in the dark before and accidentally pressed up against the back door but nowhere near actual penetration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stopped using facebook when I realized that I don't want to spend all day listening to everyone I know bitch and moan about stupid mundane crap while I'm doing my own thing on my free time. I listen to it enough when I'm socially obligated to do so in person. 

I also have quite a lot of family members (and to a lesser extent friends) who have views on certain topics that are just appalling in my opinion. I don't want to constantly read their opinions on said topics. I can pretty easily put my foot down in person and say I'm not having a conversation about something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once you're actually orbiting the earth you're not accelerating anymore but instead you're free falling toward the earth at the same rate of speed that the earth is curving away from you. You experience g-force during acceleration, so you would not experience any g-force while orbiting.

Edit: Its also worth noting that the speed at which you need to go to escape earth's gravity depends on a number of things but in this situation mostly the angle at which you're moving. At the speed of light, something with mass could orbit the earth at nearly surface level, assuming nothing got in the way, such as a tree, or a car, a building or a human. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There needs to be pre warning in general, so people aren't surprised by a sudden blockage in the road and 10 relatively unprotected people. 

Also, a good portion of the time it's a lane closure, and they begin to taper the two lanes into one slowly giving 2 lanes of cars plenty of time to merge into one, in theory.

Also, they're often preparing construction even where they aren't current working (or so it appears). This can be misleading. They are actually doing something there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An underage smoking ticket. I was under 18, and smoking, so let me clarify *why* this was so ridiculous. 

The legal smoking age in the US (or any tobacco products for that matter) is 18. This is also the age where you legally become an adult. 

I was definitely breaking the law, so a ticket was in order, but here's the fun part: Since I was 17 years old, I was charged as an adult, which for this particular citation meant triple the fine. Instead of a $100 fine, I got a $300 fine. 

Yes, you read that right. I was **charged as an adult for committing a crime that had I been an adult, would not have been a crime.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in a gas station and this kind of thing is bound to happen occasionally and it's not really a big deal. Sometimes you grab something thinking you want it and decide you want something else and put it down there. It's lazy but not really a big deal. 

The other day though... this lady stops right in front of the door (which is a no parking zone as per fire code) but made a very fast beeline to the bathroom. I figured she had a turtle head poking out so I let it slide (no pun intended) and said nothing. She was in there for like half an hour. When she finally came out she just walked outside and got in her car and sat there for another 10 or so minutes. Then she got back out and came inside with 2 girls (I'd guess 10 and 13). I figured they were gonna buy something, but no, she says to the kids "Wait for me here I'll be right back".

The kids immediately begin grabbing handfuls of merchandise from one shelf and putting it on other shelves. Like 30+ misplacements with a minute. So I calmly walked out and began putting things back where they belong and said "You're gonna stop doing that." Now one of the kids keeps grabbing a random item and running to me saying "How much is this???", handing it to me and then saying "Never mind I don't want it" while the other one slinks away behind some shelves or aisles to continue misplacing items and potentially steal shit. 

Normally when I watch a suspicious person, I try to make like I'm doing something else that requires me to be near them until I actually see them shoplifting or whatever. Not this time, these kids were straight up **brats.** I just stood there staring daggers at them the entire time their mom was in the bathroom. 

So like 10 more minutes go by and mom comes back out of the crapper and says to the kids "Were there any problems? Did anyone bother you?" The older one says "This guy (points to me) was following us around staring. It was scary." then hugs her mom. Her mom gives me a death stare and says something about how she was gonna buy something but not anymore, bitches a bit more and storms out with her daughters. I was dumbfounded. </TEXT>
