Because he has literally had a handful of matches on the main shows.  He is still in the very early stages of his career in the WWE. 

I wish his character either had more depth or they just pushed him as an asshole that can have a really good match

He is literally that.  He is an asshole that has had amazing matches.

<TEXT> Wow... there is so much wrong with that that my head hurts.  

You have no clue what was intended for Rusev if he hadn't gotten injured.  He was supposed to be in the IC title match and there was a good chance he was going to win. 

Wyatt has always been the character that wanders and randomly feuds with others.  This was happening before he ever started the Cena feud.  Also, the guy got to face Taker at Wrestlemania which is something someone who is doing poorly wouldn't get an opportunity for.  He is also in a meaningful feud with someone the company views as one of it's top stars, whom he also beat last night.  

Not everyone can be in the title pictures so there will be feuds with others.  People automatically view someone not feuding for a title as they are buried and just losers.  There is too much importance set on the titles being the only way a wrestler is not "buried".

All of these people are still on TV and getting stories and feuds so yeah... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not just the stories, but his actual matches too.  Same formula.  Show up, gyrate and slick hair back, point to self getting in ring, slight offense, get ass kicked, oversell, comeback (clotheslines, corner splash, neckbreaker, yeahhhhh!) more ass kicking, occasional Zig Zag outta nowhere, get hit with finisher and oversell).  I'm not saying he is horrible, just boring and predictable (same could be said about others, i.e. Orton, Sheamus, etc).  HE could be used better somewhere else like GFW or ROH or NJPW, although he would make far less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree to a point.  It is tough though because there are too many people out there that will like the bad guys no matter what and will not boo.  But yes, there needs to be a resurgence in the amount of heel tactics in matches like eye raking/gouging, cheap shots, low blows, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In essence yes, you are giving them a reaction.  But, there is still a fundamental difference between booing and cheering.  Booing shows your disdain for a wrestler while cheering shows your support. For example, if Barrett is facing Neville and he hits him with a Bull Hammer, he should not get a standing ovation.  He should get a rousing chorus of boos because he is the bad guy. </TEXT>

And once again let me say that you chose to read this post even though you knew going in you were going to be negative about it.

An imposter Kane showed up mask and all and the whole thing culminated in Kane throwing the imposter out of the building and taking the mask.  Then nothing happened with it.  Decent build but horrible outcome.  

P.S. The imposter Kane was played by Festus/Luke Gallows/Doc </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abyss disappeared and then out of the blue his "brother" showed up looking for him.  After a while he started wrestling but wasn't much good at it.  Then on occassion he would get busted open and he would snap showing Abyss tendencies (i.e. using his moves like the Black Hole Slam).  This started happening more and more to the point where people caught on that he had a "split personality" and was really Abyss the whole time.  Joseph Park was his way of dealing with getting away from his violent lifestyle.  Then if I'm not mistaken it wasn't split personality but just Abyss pretending to be his own brother. </TEXT>
