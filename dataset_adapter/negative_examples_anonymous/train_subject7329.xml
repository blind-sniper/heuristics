<TEXT> yah  i agree with BuiltToSpil1 (amazing band too)  but i get 60 1 mg ativan a month and they used to hit me but know they make me feel normal.  I have used/abused everyother benzo and xanax is the best imo for recreation but I am not using for that anymore . I only use when I really have to and find some extras by the end of the month.  i would saw ativan is a coors light compared to a mickeys or steel reserve (xanax) haha i dunno might not be the best comparision </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am currently getting 60 1mg ativans a month.  I have been with the same doctor for about 6 months. she started me at 30 .5 ativans so I am pretty happy she's jumped me up this fast. My question is I want to change my script to klonopin since from my experience they last longer.  So far pretty much any request I have asked to change my meds she easily has done for me. I have also been on SSRI anti depression meds for about 15 years now so I'm not just someone trying to get high. </TEXT>

They will try to set you up on anything first before benzos, hell i was on an ssri for 15 years and it was still hard for me to get anything.  they are very concerned about handing them out like candy anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello I have been on an SSRI (Paxil) for about 12 years.  I got on it for depression and anxiety.  It's worked OK for the depression but I have in the last few years been suffering from pretty decent anxiety. I went to a counselor that works for the county and she was really nice.  She diagnosed me with anxiety and PTSD.  On friday I go in to the actual doctor to "get something for my anxiety" I used quotations because this is what the counselor said.  What would they give me to go along with the SSRI I am taking?  Thanks for looking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It takes a while to find the right person that you can work with.  For me it has at least. I have recently been working with a mental health worker that has assessed my situation. She says I have anxiety/PTSD.  I'm going back on Friday for my actual medical visit with a doctor to give me/ alter meds.  I have been on Paxil (SSRI) for 15 years.  Hopefully I will get to finally have a med that works better than Paxil for 15 years. The lady that I have been working with is going to come in with me to the doctor and she said "at the very least we need to get you something for your panic attacks"  I was glad to at least hear that.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are seriously in pain and can prove it, there should be no big problem obtaining medicine for the pain.  Depending on what it is they might only start you out on 800mg Ibuprofen or Tramadol.  I used to get 120 10/325 Norcos every month from my doctor til that ended badly. Your most likely going to have to work your way up to something decent.  It's getting hard now to get anything unless you are dying or have cancer.  Doctors are really getting nervous to script narcotic pain meds because of the DEA cracking down.  I have been told this from doctors themselves. </TEXT>

I really have no tolerance I guess now because I haven't been able to find a doctor to script me anything.  I looked last night a few hours online for etiz online to buy but I guess I was on the wrong sites because everyone was sold out. That is why I am now considering another RC.  I would like to pay with credit and I am very weary of getting ripped off. Do you know of anywhere that rates these sites?  I guess it would not be good if I asked you for any places online to buy?  sorry about these remedial questions but I want to know these things before I place and order and get ripped off. Thanks.

<TEXT> So within the next couple of weeks I will most likely be put on ritalin or adderall.  I used to take dexedrine for ADD as a kid back in middle school.  Now as an adult (32) it was recommended I go back on something to try and help with my ADD.  I have done some research but would there be any reason to try and get adderall over ritalin or vice versa?  Do they still prescribe dexidrene?  I would just like some opinions from people that have taken both. thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah i've been told that actually.  Thing is can't you go into a doctor that is certified to prescribe methadone for pain and tell him you want to be switched from your meds to methadone?  I guess he would just have to look at you and your history and see if you have dr shopped or been flagged at pharmacies before?  I was going to do this when I was on norco and wanted to stop taking it but I just ended up going to a methadone clinic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i assume your a guy. how old are you?  seems like a situation like me when i was referred to PM from my regular doc.  she had meset up 120 yellow norcos a month for a couple years so i thought i'd be getting stepped up since I was being referred. She even told me I'd get something better.  First thing when I walk in the head dudes office.  He reads my papers and his eyes just buldge out  " you've been talking all this norco for how long?!?!?!"  "Why?!?!?"  So I immediately knew I was over with ever getting narcotics again.  It was the worst feeling of my life actually.  I tried to hold in not crying.  He sent a note to my regular doc no more narcotics and that is that.  fuck that fucking guy.  The reason why I shared my story is that I feel its very similar to yours where I was doing good, felt comfy at my prescription and didn't feel like it would ever be taken away since my doc I'd been with for 10 years and was almost family to me.  So when I went to see her after the meeting with top scumbag at PM she just basically told me she has to adhere to whatever he says since he's a higher up.  Just so pissed man, one minute I had my doctor telling me that once I'm on PM they will bump me up to something better that Norco the next minute I am prescriptionless.

<TEXT> Even my own doctor that cut me off last year told me it was crackin in the early 2000s then once about 2010 came around doctors are like WTF we are up shits creek here because we've been way over prescribing narcotics and people were popping them like candy.  That's exactly what my doctor told me as she yanked away my script that i had for 2 years for 120 norcos.  I believe her some but she also said the DEA are finally getting they're act togother after so many famous people died roughly in that decade due to narcotics prescribed by them from their doctors.  It sucks now because anyone with legitamite pain it's nearly impossible to get something past tramadol because doctors are scared they will lose their jobs.

<TEXT> I was always scared of H because of the stigma that it has.  Since we were little kids I believe that the government, media, your parents, etc always would tell you never to do drugs but I felt that they put the most emphasis on H being that it was the strongest drug that could kill you the fastest.  Anyways I grew with that injected into my brain so that when I actually tried it for the first time I was kind of underwhelmed to be honest since I was already using norco and oxy, I was told its way cheaper to just go the H route and it is but If I had unlimited money i'd go withthe pharms over H just mainly cause its from a lab so you know what your exactly getting. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have been on Paxil for quite a long time now- 12 years and I feel like it really isn't working anymore.  I also was able to get a few small scripts for Ativan.  Problem is my regular doctor doesn't think i should be taking any benzos for a long period- no more than like a week at a time because its addictive blah blah.  I ran out of my last script of 20 1mg pills and she won't refill it for me so I am kind of in a withdrawl right now.  Sucks because I feel a lot better when I take just one 1mg of Ativan and I don't feel any better when taking my Paxil.  Here is my question: It seems like a lot of people on this forum have a decent ongoing script for benzos.  How did you go about getting it? I'm not asking for a ton of pills, just something that is more longterm that 1 or 2 scripts of 30 pills a year.  My doctor has referred me to a psychiatrist who I see tomorrow and she will be managing my psych meds from now on not my medical doctor.  I wasn't even going to post this but I might have a better shot at getting something that actually works for me on more of an ongoing basis because I feel pretty crappy now!! Thanks for any advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got a new primary care doctor. I am currently on paxil (12 years) and ativan probably a few months. My new doctor has no problem keeping me on the paxil but hesitantly scripted me some ativan and said that is not a medicine to be taken long times. She is referring me to a psychiatrist to go over my meds and possibly change them. I have a feeling its to get me off ativan.  I never heard anywhere about it being used only short periods of time.  I feel like um being tricked into giving up my meds. Anyone have any advice!?!? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the DEA is trying to make people use heroin by tightening up the regulations and restrictions when it comes to controlled substances (mainly opiates).  As someone who used to personally have a decent script for opiate painkillers I was eventually cut off for no reason other than being told that the DEA is watching very closely now and bye bye.  No mention of my body and what I will do now to combat my pain.  So what'd I do?  Go to the street and get heroin  I am just 1 person so I am positive this has happened to many many people already and its just the start.  I am on methadone now because I don't like the junky lifestyle and hustling every single day, waiting on you dealer, getting bad cut drugs, legal risk, robbed, beat up, dying, etc.  I feel that being on methadone right now is the best option right now but it will never touch how well I had it before. I never expected to have my script pulled out from under my feet like it was. </TEXT>

I went to a podiatrist and he recommended surgery but I don't really want to do that now since I am still relatively young.  I still skate but I always wear these good ankle braces I found at Walgreens. They have hard plastic around the brace and they lace up.  Really good support.

<TEXT> I can't agree more!!  When things started to get rough with money and as my tolerance was building I was in straight up hustle mode for I'd say a bit longer than a month, but looking back at it, that time felt like six months.  It was the same thing everyday: wake up and hopefully have something left in the house to get me going then it was off to try and make as close to $100 because I'd usually like to get as much as I could at a time. I'd makey money mainly scrapping metal or recycling but where I live those methods aren't extremely efficient due to people recycling there own shit to make money themselves and just lack of finding .material to scrap.  I cannot see how people can do that shit for like 10+ years but I see them at the clinic I go to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been in for about 3 months just about to come up on my take homes and as I today (i just talked with the head of the clinic), I haven't missed a day and have had all clean UA's.  Have I relapsed since I have been in? Yes I have used H several times but been lucky enough to have it out of my system by the time they UA and it is always random which makes it a bit more scary.  I want to stop using once I start getting take home since if I do get caught I gotta start over again but it's more tempting now because I'm thinking exactly what you are thinking haha.  I don't really have any advice, maybe just try not to use?  Thats the only foolproof way but is a bit hard when you are still at the beginning of maintenence. Also if you gotta use, try to use the day you get UA afterwards or the next day very soon after you were UA'd so less of a chance to get UA'd again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> okay I don't know any better but I would just think it would be a bit safer to ask for a higher dosage.  I mean I started with just vicodin and ended up eventually smoking bth and that is something I regret but it is just way cheaper than pH arms. Plus same as you my tolerance was building. I dunno I just got cut off from a 3 year steady script of norcos for no reason so I'd assume if doctor found track marks on you it'd be no more scripts for you. I guess just be careful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ah you remind me of myself at 21-just starting to jump thru the hoops of trying to attain that first script. I am assuming you have little to no tolerance.  Most likely your gonna get 5/500s if any narcotic is scripted.  Once those don't do the trick anymore its time for more fun- trying to obtain norcos or oxy from your doc.  After a fair amount of time and a lot of work put in convincing and buttering up your doctor(s) you will hopefully have an ongoing script for a halfway decent opiate.  haha sorry I kinda went off on a tangent I don't even know if you are trying to go the route of getting an ongoing script but  yeah your gonna have to start slow and small, this shit doesn't happen overnight. </TEXT>

I think it's working out ok but the past couple years I have felt more and more anxious and have had probably 10 or so panic attacks in the last couple years.  Would I benefit from a benzo? If so what kind?  Would a doctor be more willing to prescribe me a benzo seeing that I've been on Paxil for so long?  Thanks guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK well you seem to be in a good position right now.  I have had to sign those contracs too.  I also think it's a bit harder to get a script if you are younger and a male which I assume you are younger person?  also I wasn't trying to be harsh but I noticed I really didn't need my pain medicine as much as I thought after not having them.  I still have the records of being on a narcotic for several years since then I have changed insurance and my doctor and probably could find a new doctor to start prescribing me again but I am over spending all the energy and time going to do doctors and hoping they will give me my medicine back so for now I am just on methadone and actually the done has made my life a lot better since I am NOT worrying when I'm going to run out of my script and have to go to the street and buy some H or pills. the last few months were pretty expensive since I had you end up doing that a bit but now on methadone I never need to worry about running out of meds and it's free. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Going and once a month should be a law pretty soon at least that's what my doctor told me.  We also had a great relationship for several years as I thought until she for some random reason got scared to keep prescribing what she said was the maximum amount of norcos a month .  She mentioned obamacare and the DEA getting stricter on pain meds.  all I know is about six or seven years ago it was a ton easier to get these meds.  I think most doctors are going to try and wean their patients off the narcotic drugs in the next few years.  Now I'm stuck on methadone.  Do you really need these pills?

<TEXT> I tried suboxone first before methadone and it didn't work for me.  I went back to using for a while and when things started to get out of hand I started to research methadone because like you, I was apprehensive of it.  after weeding out all the myths and rumors about methadone I decided to give it a try.  I am really glad I did because if I did not try it I would still be addicted and in a very worst place than I was before methadoneso for me it has worked out to be a better situation right now in my life then how I was living it before </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I agree with you. Before I trieed methadone I tried suboxone and it didn't hold me enough so I went back to using for a bit.  I was getting worse with using more by the week so I decided to do a bit of research on methadone to get the facts about it-not the myths or rumors because beforehand I was a bit apprehensive to try methadone- I thought that it was left for hardcore junkies.  Well since I started on it it has really helped i'm really happy because I was thinking to myself if methadone doesn't work I have nothing else to fall back on so I was getting a bit scared.  luckily it worked! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I got a methadone I used any opiate I could my hands on. The first time I tried to stop I used suboxone.  I didn't like it it didn't take the edge off enough so I went back to using again. Towards the end before I got on done I was smoking both up to a gram a day. Since being on methadone for 3 months I've only relapsed once. For me methadone is really great and does the trick.  If you ever seriously consider stopping I think methadone can really help you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All I know is that day by day doctors and hospitals are tightening up on giving out opiates like they did say 8 or so years ago.  I live in California so I don't know where that state lies on being liberal about dispensing narcotics but I was told to my face by my doc of 5 years whom I had trusted that DEA is really cracking down, blah blah blah.  What really pissed me off is that I was like family with her, she was the one who got me started on pain meds in the first place too.  Vicodin 5s then slowly moved up to Norco.  All I am saying I guess is that I thought for sure I was sitting pretty and had no worries about getting my script pulled out from under me but it did happen.  Sucks because this is going to be happening more and more now as doctors become increasingly hesistant to give out opiates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been down both of those paths.  I never really thought of it though.  I can tell you though that i enjoy opiates way much more than alcohol any day.  I used to not be able to go 1 day without booze and likewise for opiates.  I just got sick of drinking so I gave it up cold turkey and luckily felt a lot better with out any kind of withdrawls.  I drank everyday for about 4 years straight.  Now with opiates I was doing some form of them for about 5 years straight too.  I was scripted norcos for a long time but thanks to doctor's getting scared now about scripting anything I got cut off. I now am on methadone.  To answer your question is a bit hard actually now that i think of it.  I don't think I could give you a solid answer other than repeating that opiates are always #1 to me over any other substance.

<TEXT> i smoked some bth once since being on mmt and it wasn't as much of a rush or high as usual but it was there for sure- the high but it was weaker than normal.  also could be a bit of placebo effect know that methadone is supposed to block other opiates.  I am on 50mg currently only on mmt for 3 weeks.  I slipped up because it's just the ritual of smoking bth that I love.  I have norcos at my house and I haven't touched them since starting mmt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i have been on opiates legally prescribed to me for about 5 years.  I recently moved so i have a new pain doc who was giving me norcos.  in the recent last few months my using was getting a bit out of control- buying on the street, even smoking a bit of tar and I thought to myself i should do something about this.  I have done suboxone in the past but they just didn't work for me.  I researched methadone for a couple weeks then I went down and started on the program.  I made an appoinment with my pain doc about a week in and told him what I was doing (in my state the law states that if you are in a clinic you do not have to tell your doctor.  But i went ahead an was honest to him and he was actually really proud of me and encouraging.  I was pretty nervous and the appoinment went by so fast that I forgot to even ask him if he would prescribe me it.  Probably not now that he know's I was in a clinic but I am trying to really be "clean"  now instead of spending all my money on pills or H since my script was not making it even close to the end of the month.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been on done for about 2 weeks now.  It's a clinic deal and I have to drive there 7 days a week to get my stuff and I live about 30 mins away.  I was wondering if it would be possible to get a doctor to script me done instead of doing what I have to do everyday.  It's a bit expensive on gas with the drive everyday.  I did some research and I think that it is possible to get it from a doctor instead of going to a clinic everday and dosing.  Just wanting any feedback if anyone has tried to get scripted thru a doc.  I have a history of chronic pain that is documented and have a current pain mgmt doctor.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just started it last week but i'm doing it to get "clean" so I am in a program and go everyday to get my dose.  I am on a fairly low dose (50mg)  and i have yet to really feel a high from it. more just like it keeps most of my withdrawls and cravings at bay so I can get on with my life and not worry about how i'm gonna hustle up $100 a day for H.  If you were to have no tolerance to opiates I could see it as being ok but never understood why people would ever do it recreationally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> same exact thing happened to me basically last fall.  we are living in an era now that we will be seeing a huge decline in prescribing pain meds and it's going to fuck shit up worse because people who would never had before will now be trying heroin.  my doctor just gave me the go to answers: DEA cracking down, Obama Care and the fact that a small amount of dumbasses had to go and OD and fuck it up for the rest of us responsible people.  As for advice, fuck it just go to the street and find some H, that is what I did when I got cut off my pills. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK this was on wiki:   Under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine, heroin is a legally prescribed controlled drug in the United Kingdom, and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as morphine is, often being preferred over morphine due to its lower side-effect profile.[citation needed] It is also available for prescription to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark, alongside psycho-social carein the same manner that methadone or Suboxone (buprenorphine) are used in the United States and Canada[10][11]and a similar programme is being campaigned for by liberal political parties in Norway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been doing pills for about 5 years now.  Everything from 5's to OP 80s.  I'm getting sick of paying out the ass for pills. $200 for like 8 blues is not my piece of cake.  I know where I can get tar heroin.  I assume that the H would go a lot farther than buying pills financially speaking?  I also would plan on smoking it and I assume you would foil it?  I have never done H before and want to know how much to try at first.  I would think like a pin head size?   Getting on subs and getting clean is my long term goal but before I am done with opiates I would like to just try this once.  Please don't criticize me, I just want some honest advice here!!! thanks guys. and oh my tolerance is decent.  lets say 120mg oxy daily but could handle more without completely nodding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've seen a few posts here and there about seroquel and taking it with opiates but never really got much from those threads.  I guess basically the seroquel intensifies the nodding effects.  Curious because today i was prescribed seroquel and took 100mg and so far not much!!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> actually my story is just an example of how this shit can backfire in your face.  i thought that since my doc was referring me to a pain specialist i'd be taken care of right??  well the exact opposite happened. Yes they will or at least should pee test you but if you are on narcotics already you should pee positive for them and that is completely fine.  They want to make sure you are actually taking the medicine that they prescribe to you.  but yeah hopefully what happened to me doesnt to you-just a cautionary tale of when everything should be set in stone it gets all fucked up.  Murphy's law at it's finest.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> i have to say I was on about the exact same dosage as you and put on 8mg twice a day.  It worked yes but in the end jacked up my tolerance immensly so that when i went back to use i had to take way more to feel the same effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok. i've never done any drugs other than weed so the freebase part i don't follow but its all good.  so the other day my homie got a small amount of tar for $50. i looked at it. seemed a bit bigger than say a nickel. i thought it was just so small but now that you told me only a match head size you can smoke to get 3 hits off of it makes more sense now.

<TEXT> tramadol is so weak I am surprised you get anything from it. but that's actually good for you if you can still catch a buzz from it.  Why don't you tell your doctor you at least need something to replace the tramadol with.  If you get lucky he might give you something better but i'd stay away from saying names of meds like "I want Norco" or etc.  its not fair that he cut you off completely he should at least taper you.  I have been in very similar situations too.

<TEXT> I am just using trams for being able to sleep thru the night right now.  that and gabapentin help a lot.  I don't have a huge habit/tolerance.  I'd say about 120 mg hydro daily. but lately like the last month i can't sleep up until 8am without jerking all around and crawling outta my skin.  That sucks and I am now realizing shit is getting serious.  So anyways I got tramadol and gaba scripted to me and take them around 2am and they really do help me just sleep.  I am trying to keep my tolerance in check so yeah in that respect if you have em for maintenince and don't want to go crazy with your tolerance they do help. </TEXT>

Thing is somehow it was legal to sell because it was only 7.xx real heroin so they were able to find a loophole I guess haha. I think i remember it was sold and shipped from some little tiny country as well. Woke up like damn!! not real.  Anyways thought I would share that with everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK I have been using this lately for withdrawls in between my doses.  I am taking pills-oxy or hydro.  In the early morning I had been getting the classic symptoms-jerky body, restless legs, basically couldn't sleep and I did NOT want to waste my precious limited suppy of real opiates so I was able to procure a script from my doc. Took 2-3 around 2am and voila no more symptoms whatsoever. I can now get a great mornings sleep.  Other than that, the times I did take Trams they made me a bit nauseous but I was riding in a car and hadn't had much to eat.  As far as recreational value, if you have little to no opiate tolerance I bet they would be kinda cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> so i started on subs a week ago.  lasted a week but had a ton of norco so 2 days ago i took some.  i waited about 30 hours for it to be out of my system.  Problem is that its not hitting me the same as it did before I took subs.  I know the whole thing about the bupe blocking your opiate receptors and it could take a bit for real opiates to work.  Its now friday afternoon and i last dosed my subs at 11am tuesday.  Do I need to keep waiting or are my receptors just fried??  I hope I can still get somewhat high again.  I am a noob to subs but not to opiates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> same thing basically happened to me but i got completely cut off.  I had an appoinment yesterday with a "pain phychiratrist"  and she said that about 8-10 years ago it was fairly easy to get opiates prescribed from your doctor but in just the last year or 2 they have really been tightening up and its only going to be harder to get legal dope. she cited the obvious reasons - the DEA and all the dumbass famous people that couldnt handle their shit that is all in the media BUTTT  she also said that there have been recent studies showing that opiates do not really help for long term pain unless you are really old/have cancer its going to be near impossible and the fact that I am 32 not 62 makes it a lot harder for me to acquire those meds. that is basically what she told me.  She was really nice, straightforward and honest so I have no reason not to believe what she told me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> so this week I am waving the white flag and going to try suboxone after having my doctor cut me off after prescribing me opiates for about 5 years.  I have been using around 10 norcos daily for the last 6 months.  I have heard people say that subs might be a bit too much for my habit but i really don't know what to do as I will soon be out of norcos with no script anymore.  both of my parents and a lot of my family have died from drugs so the addiction and craving is pretty instilled in me.  thinking subs might help with that.  thoughts?!?!  thanks!! </TEXT>

Well since I got cut off my plan on tuesday is to just put up the white flag and get on suboxone.  i am just sick and tired of playing the game with my doctor and sometimes going to the streets since my tolerance has gone up.  I got screwed but fuck it.  Just hope that people will take heed to my warning even if they are set up with a cushy doctor like I was.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> honestly I just wish they could prescribe opiates for depression!! I have been on Paxil for about 12 years and i feel like it does jack shit.  but the minute I take a pain pill i'm a new person.  and to top it off it does alleviate my physical pain as well when I can take all the ibuprofen in the world and that won't cut it.  I am definatly mentally and physically addicted to pain meds and have to qualms admitting that.  yes I am tired of playing the whole doctor game and i guess being cut off could be a good thing in the end for me possibly.  also the big head honcho pain doc doesn't even adhere to MRI's  he told me you take 10 normal people, MRI them and 9/10 will come back with some kind of damage.  This guy was a complete piece of fucking work. </TEXT>

I am i think about in the same boat as you where its a fine line between using them for what they are intended for or just strictly for recreation.  also I am not trying to scare you but i was in your exact doctor situation and it happened to me so I guess always have a back up plan if you plan on staying on opiates for a while. </TEXT>

You can physically see how gnarled and distorted my feet are. I had an MRI done about 5 years ago and you could see the internal damage and I am sure that my ankles have just gotten worse since then.  I will admit though I love opiates and the way they make me feel, I am addicted. So maybe this is the wake up call I need to get off of them even though I have legit pain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok the only problem is that I have Kaiser insurance right now.  I can't just switch docs under my Kaiser insurance because any doctor working under Kaiser will see that it was recommended that I be cut off of my monthly script (120 norcos) so I don't think I could even stay with Kaiser.  I could try to change insurances and completely get out of Kaiser (which I plan on doing sooner or later) but in the time being paying out of pocket with no insurance is not going to be fun.  So I am just kind of stuck in a rough place because even if I tried to get new medical insurance today it still would take probably months for it to kick in. I live in California if that makes any difference.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my last post I told everyone how i was cut off by my doctor.  I have been scripted 120 10/325s for about 2 years now. I am under Kaiser Permanente northern california. She has been wanting me to do the Kaiser pain program for about 8 months telling me how good the head doctor is and how much she respects him.  I thought ok if she is referring me to a pain program I should be set right?!?!  Big mistake.  It took me about 2 months just be seen but when I went to my appointment he walks in and immediately says you need to stop taking norco.  he then berates me for about 20 mins about how much pain he has had for the last 30 years and he only takes about 4 percocet a month.  anyways i knew that i was fucked when he said he wanted me cut off since my regular doc that prescribes me the norcos looks up to this guy.  After that i have my app with her and she is like yep, you are done.  Most fucked up thing is she told me verbally more than once that when I got into this pain program that they would "at least start me on some low dose oxycontin"  I cannot believe what dirty shit was pulled on me.  I have had the same primary doctor for over 5 years and she was basically family to me.  She would always hug me and tell me I was one of her favorites.  Anyways my question is, I am thinking of ditching Kaiser all together and trying to get onto something like Medical.  I have proof I have been scribed the norcos for several years.  How hard would it be to get a new doctor to carry over that script?  Is it worth trying?  It's not like i'm coming out of the blue asking for them so I would think I have a bit of an advantage but just want to know everyone's thoughts. THANKS!!!!!

<TEXT> thanks man. the reason why i brought up subs is that I aknowledge that i am physically and mentally addicted to opiates.The small amount of research that I have done leads me to believe that it helps with your mental cravings for opiate which I need to address. Even if i was to taper off the norcos that would work but would probably not do shit to stop me from craving them mentally.  I dunno though...... </TEXT>

<TEXT> i have had withdrawls before when I had to stop taking a smaller dose in the past. it sucked but wasn't the end of the world.  Obamacare is what he is blaming this on.  I get 120 a month but I usually take up to 8 a day ( i know i know haha)  i went to suboxone.com and found several docs in my area.  i guess i will just call around tomorrow and tell them my situation and if its even logical to do?  i couldn't really find anything on the site that was specific about how much you take or what you take pertaining to if suboxone would help that.  I will admit that I am physically and mentally addicted though so I thought this could work. thanks for the input.

<TEXT> so I just found out today that my doctor who has had me on norco for the last 4 years wants to to quit cold turkey and is cutting me off. this really sucks but it's something I guess I have to deal with.  How do I go about obtaining a suboxone script and is this the best option to help me? I mentioned it to her and she kinda wrote me off, i don't think she was in a good mood.  I am on about 6-8 10mg Norcos.  thanks guys.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sure there are tons of threads on this, maybe not but fuck it haha I thought I would share my experience as it happens. I was bored and took a super low dose of Diphenhydramine (15mg) then 4 norcos about 30 mins later.  It has been about 45 mins since the norco dose and it feels a bit stronger than usual but not like out of control sedated.  I really haven't tried to potentiate my meds before other than tonic water and gf juice which I thought were very trivial potentiators.  What does everyone prefer to use for potentiators, or do most of you just think they are a waste of time?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate with a lot of you said in this post.  I am as well addicted to food and was anorexic at age 18-20.  luckily that passed quickly and I spent most of my 20s focusing on alcohol to where it became a daily chore just to maintain my buzz. that got old and i had a couple years of no real issues which was nice.  the last few years I have been bulimic and i honestly don't know why i even do it or how I started it. I don't do it so I can look pretty for other people, its strictly personal.    I have always been extremely anxious as well and I think that is part of the reason that I get hung up in these situations.  I also feel that having an eating disorder and being a male makes it a bit harder for people to understand- at least the people around me in my life.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> here is the deal i've been with the same doc for about 5 years now and have developed a rapport with her.  I am currently being prescribed 120 norcos a month for legitimate pain that MRI's will back up. I take usually about 3-4 a day so I don't feel that I am abusing them since when I take them I can actually move around and be somewhat limber.  I actually have a bit of a stockpile of them cause i've been a good guy haha.  Anyways last time I met up with her she wanted to refer me to the chronic pain program. I have never been in a situation like this. Is this good or bad?  FYI I am going thru Kaiser Permanente in northern california so if anyone has any experiences please share. thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If heroin or opiates in general were legal to purchase in the US meaning you can go to Walgreens and buy opiate pills as you would like at anytime just like say ibuprofen then I believe possibly a lot more people would start using them because they would realize how much more effective they actually are than non narcotics when it comes to real pain. the problem with this of course is you have a small percentage of idiots who will of course abuse and od on said narcotics.  Natural selection perhaps?!?! I don't even have to state that crime would rapidly decrease if this were the case though.  For the record I am legally prescribed a small amount of opiate painkillers which I do take daily and responsibly.   </TEXT>

Since all the guy gave me was the cellophane wrapping from a cig package to put em in I just threw em the tic tac container for the hour long drive back so they didn't get lost.  Will do it again if i don't have an actual pill bottle and recommend it as well haha! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did once on codiene cough syrup. one of the worst experiences of my life. drank about 1/2 bottle of the syrup and drank alcohol through out the course of the night. i had tried codiene cough syrup before but only in small doses and it felt great but this time around i honestly did not feel that buzzed so i just got bored and fell asleep.  next morning i woke up (luckily) and i felt extremely depressed/anxious and just crappy mentally. Like so much after a few days of feeling this way I got scared and actually went and saw a psycharatrist and told him what had happened and that i was starting to get very worried that i could of really fucked myself up mentally for life.  he said that basically what i was going thru was more or less normal and it was me withdrawing from the drugs. I have gone thru withdrawls from opiates before and this was nothing like it has ever been for me but yeah.  He gave me some valium which i only ended up taking 1 because it just made me feel loopy i guess and didn't really solve anything.  I'd say that it took the better part of a month to actually feel back to normal mentally.  Very scary stuff!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm still trying to figure out how this is legal to sell since making the tea is supposedly giving you the same effect as taking an opiate in which you need a script for. Is it just some weird loophole that the FDA hasn't realized yet?  Don't get me wrong I love opiates so I am not bitching about it but it's fascinating that there isn't some kind of restriction on it.  I haven't tried making the tea yet either but I have been contemplating it.  Anything I should be aware of before I make it or any really bad side effects? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did a search for it and doesn't look like anyone has posted about getting car sick while on opiates.  The other night I took 3 norcos while being a passenger in a vehicle.  Felt alright for about 30mins then felt really nauseous like classic carsickness. Just tried to focus on the yellow line until I got home about 20 mins later and felt like shit so I laid down for about 20 mins and felt better but it sucked and kinda ruined my buzz haha.  The last time this happened to me was about 8 years ago after I had gotten out of the hospital and was on vicodin I got car sick as well.  I always have avoided being in a car while on opiates because of that first experience but 2 out of 2 times now I have gotten carsick while on opiates.  I never get carsick if I'm sober or even drunk I do better than when on opiates. </TEXT>

What are your guys opinions on parachuting versus just eating them or crush then down the hatch? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get blood tests done monthly and one thing they check is my liver.  I have been on 5/500s for about 4 years and recently switched to 10/325s.  My liver readings are slightly and i mean trivially high. my alt serum test is at 40 which is 3 points higher than recommended. What really made my liver readings go threw the roof in the past was when I was drinking a lot of alcohol on a daily basis at that point my liver reading was 150!! Since I have stopped drinking almost completely my liver readings are back to normal.  I don't know if this answers really anything about your question but it does go to show that the liver is capable of repairing itself when a person stops abusing it like i was at one point. </TEXT>

I am just doing this mainly because i know my normal doctor is getting to the end of her string with prescribing me my stuff and i really don't think i should ask her for any more than i am getting already.  I don't use any other drugs than the norco, prescribed or otherwise so i don't have a problem with a pee test and i don't go on binges or abuse my meds so i should be good with adhering to some kind of policy that the pain mgmt place would make me sign.  thanks for the response!! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-12-23 05:19:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> here's the deal i've been working with my doctor who is just a general practicioner at kaiser permanente for about 5 years now. she recently (and hesitantly) bumped me up from vicodin per my request that i was concerned about my liver. i have an app with her in early jan for just a check up.  I am thinking about asking her to refer me to a pain mgmt doc but not sure how she will react to this.  I am getting 60 norcos a month from her and I feel I am twisting her arm with just that amount not because I have been bugging her about upping my dose but I did hear that general medical docs have to be careful with the amount of narcotics they prescribe because of liability?  I just get a feeling i'm skating on thin ice at that amount lol.  Anyways, i'd like anyones input on my situation or experiences.  Thanks in advance friends! </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I don't know much about beer and dislike the taste of most I've tried. Any recommendations?"  Yeah I have a recommendation- if you don't like it, don't drink it!!  I am not trying to sound/be a dick but if you honestly don't like it just stick to what you like!!  Everyone around where I live loves Sierra Nevada beer.  I have tried it several times but I just don't like it much. Its too heavy of a beer and I agree with you about light beer as I am not a huge beer guy myself and find that stuff easier to drink. I guess a lot of drinks are an acquired taste so I dunno I'm just saying if you have tried to drink beer quite a bit and still don't like it just skip it!!  haha I mean this in the best and nicest way lol.   Good luck in finding the right beer if you choose to keep trying!! </TEXT>

I only mess with pills- no H ever so its not like I could do the open air market deal is why I was mainly contemplating CL.  Sucks that it seems wayyyy easier to get heroin than some wimpy norcos haha!! I am not that hard up for pills so I doubt i'll actually ever get the balls up to do it. Still wish I knew how the SR worked 100% so I could confidently pull it off.  Anyways thanks everyone once again!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> i have been using recreationally for about 10 years now and i am still relatively young at 30.  I have been really good with not getting out of control in the amount i take as well.  i have only done pills like vicodin, percocet, norco, etc. never smoked, snorted or iv anything.  i'd say the most i've taken at once was only around 30mgs and when i use its around 20mg so yeah i would like to think that i am pretty responsible with my habit. I have had morphine in the hospital and it was great but i couldn't function whatsoever and have never tried seeking it out otherwise.  getting to your question:  Man, that's a hard one.  I'd really like to hope things never get that bad where I would feel the need to shoot heroin.  I enjoy life and need to be a functioning member of society or at least try to be lol and i feel that if i was shooting up heroin then that wouldn't be possible.  I just feel like if life is so bad where you are using heroin and I have rarely heard of a heroin user who cannot go a day without using, then your fucked basically.  Who knows, I might end up one day going that route but i'd really not want to at this point in my life. hope this makes some sense.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah i'm basically in the same boat. i just kinda went through the motions and graduated high school.  then at least when i went to college i was able to have a lot more control of the type of classes i could take so it was a bit easier but i still hate sitting in a classroom for x amount of hours. i know a lot of people that use add/adhd as an excuse for a lot of their shortcomings and it's just annoying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> never tried adderall but i was on dexedrine which is similar to ritalin i believe.  i dunno, i was in middle school when i was prescribed it for "adhd"  i quote that because i seriously can't say if i have it or not.  its kinda a crutch a lot of people use for being dumb shits imo haha. anyways, that shit didn't really do much other than make me loose my appetite and not want to eat much.  I only took them for a few years.  I have noticed that when i take opiates i am a lot more easy going and just in a better mood all together than when i'm not on them.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> i have done the raid the medication drawer thing many a time before.  i felt/ feel really shitty about doing it but it was impossible for me not to grab a few pills when they are right there in front of me. most of the time it was just 5/500 vicodins that were leftovers (i checked the dates on the bottles if i had enough time).  that doesn't justify what i did though i know.  this was before i was able to get a legit script and i haven't done it since.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> to add onto what i just posted the last time i got tramadol i just threw it out. i thought it wouldn't do anything for me and i'm a lightweight (20mgs hydrocodone and i'm good)  is tramadol even comparable to say 5/500's?

<TEXT> if you have 1 or 2 beers you should be fine.  at least you arent taking 500's. I'd be worried most of the apap but i still wouldnt pop 6 10/325s and drink any alcohol at the same time though.  I will admit in the past i have drank and taken pills at the same time but i'm talking a few beers and 1 norco.  Its a good mellow feeling and intensifies both the beer buzz and the opiate high but I don't mix pills/alcohol anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> thats total bullshit. i am in the same boat as you i believe.  young, in actual real pain yet I do like to take pills and I will admit i love the way they make me feel.  I have quite an extensive file for injuries/surgeries for my young age so that is to my advantage but yeah its still fucking stupid how dumb it is to legally get anything. even 5mg vics. so what else is there for people like us to do?!?! i'm not gonna start going on the streets to find heroin, i know that much.....  right now i got my doc to scribe me 10/325 norcos. i only take 2 a day so i am barely scraping the surface of most of the peoples use on this reddit but i feel guilty already with that. it sucks cause i had to even build up to that with my doc!!  anyways that was really lame of her to judge you, i've had docs do that to me before. </TEXT>
