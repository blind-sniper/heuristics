<TEXT> If you'd want a rational critique, it's simply this: 

Parenting is not an auto-pilot job. It's not a job where you can become complacent. They became complacent. They made bad choices that, at every turn, lead them to the negligent act. They choose to (evidently) exhaust themselves at a park. They chose to go take a nap. They choose not to double check the car. They chose to (apparently) take in the other kids, but not do a headcount, not even notice one of them was gone.

As to the strangeness of the 30 minutes they were giving CPR and on the phone with 911, i can offer no explanation at all, which is troubling. 

This isn't a case of parents caught in the throes of some unavoidable situation; it's not a situation that could not be avoided or that any parent could have happen. This was parents who were over-extending themselves, complacent in their duty, and who failed to practice common sense and good policy. 

It was a fully avoidable, negligent death. Hell, their response to finding her might be negligent on it's own, depending how the 911 situation shakes out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly i don't mind Damon. The actor's working with some *awful* material but he does a decent job of it. He comes off as genuinely mean and genuinely threatening which is good. Plus, props to them for not just blackholing him.

The gang situation is so awful that i don't even know where to start complaining about it. It feels incredibly forced, as though they were desperate for some way to drive drama for Zig. Frankly they should have just set up a love plot for him, as it'd be more believable and less credulity-straining.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, for example, the new principal and the rules. That's an immovable object. They have to find some way to deal with/change the rules, that doesn't involve direct confrontation or talking about it or what have you; it'll take some kind of clever or fortuitous solution instead of a natural solution. 

The gangs' the same way: Zig is powerless against the gang, and all of his normal mechanisms for coping with things don't work. So he'll have to create some new method (or some outside person will have to step in, as has happened before). 

It's cheap story telling because it doesn't work to the characters strengths, and it doesn't move any kind of emotional or psychological plot forward. It's just straight up "Solve this problem, but not as you normally would" 

I'm sure there's some proper name for it in storytelling, but i always call it "whoever vs. Immovable object"; it comes up all the time in all sorts of storytelling situations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amusing story: 

For about 100 years, my town had this old, abandoned, decaying church that was sitting there rotting. The inside was so bad that it was full of pigeons who had melted into the floor as they decayed. 

So the town fathers decide to demo the (increasingly health-hazardous) building. They level the place with bulldozers, push everything into the basement, and then shovel dirt on top hauling off whatever wouldn't fit in the basement cavity.

Sure as shit, *every house* on the block got rats and mice, for three years running. 

I've always admired rats, because their just so good at surviving and thriving in the very worst environments. I just don't want them near me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> he opened fire at a building full of people hitting two of them; if that's not a mass shooting then i don't know what would be. Certainly  the FBI [would consider him](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/office-of-partner-engagement/active-shooter-incidents) an "Active Shooter".

What's frightening is that had he gone into the building where they were hiding in the bathroom, it could have been a repeat of the Adam Lanza shooting where a bunch of people got slaughtered in a bathroom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a realist. The catholic church hemorrhages membership, it's demographics start looking pretty sour, and they have a spectacularly unpopular pope *and* a bunch of scandals.

Then suddenly, here shows up Pope GoodGuy(tm) who says everything that a disillusioned world wants to hear. He wants to win over the people with money, who are activism minded, who he knows will be a real benefit to the church if he can just but lure them back. So he goes and stumps for all the popular causes that the kids today love - the environment, global warming, populist movements, income inequality, blah blah blah.

It's laughably transparent, but reddit just keeps on falling for it. </TEXT>

Plus the ISS is a *terrible* value for the money. The main science it's taught us is that humans do very poorly in prolonged zero-G and that it's obscenely expensive to keep them alive in space for any amount of time. Hell, the astronauts there spend *85% of their working hours on construction and maintenance of the station itself*. If that's not a statement of how impossible it is to practically keep people in space,  i don't know what would be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They likely got disoriented and flew either into a remote location or into water. Even experienced pilots can get disoriented and end up going the wrong way for miles. 

If the plane was anything like a [Cessna 140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_140) then it would have a cruise speed of about 100 mph. Let's assume he pulls 80 average. that's a range of *240 miles* the plane could have gone down in. 

That the wreckage hasn't been found says it's either high in a mountain, deep in a forest, or underwater. I'm voting underwater. 

I mean really the bigger mystery would be if these two didn't meet a bad end due to ill-preparedness and lack of skill.

<TEXT> Noway. The ocean, furthest you are from escape and help is about five miles. Worst case you fly in a rescue sub from somewhere and pull people out (as we do with submarine disasters, now). The area around you is a good heat sink, water is plentiful, and air can be made by simply cracking water into oxygen. We have over a century of experience with submarine issues, living, and technical challenges. Resupply is as simple as sending down some crates of food and whatnot. Realistically, having an under-sea habitat wouldn't be a whole lot worse than having an oil rig (of which we have thousands)

Space? space is *unbelievably* unpleasant. Help is days and days away at best. There's no resupply coming unless it's planned far in advance. There is no oxygen, no water, nothing for vast, vast areas. Everything that you want to have costs thousands of dollars a pound to bring up  and that's if you're lucky. There is unbelievable radiation in most areas, it's difficult to dump waste heat (an enormous problem) and if your ship gets punctured, you are bleeding away precious, difficult to replace supplies.

But maybe worst of all, there is *nothing there*. It's rocks, it's dust, it's cold. That's it. Even shipping back resources would be prohibitively expensive. </TEXT>

Instead, they died in a hot car in dallas. And it seems some significant number of people on this site consider that no big deal and not something that anyone should give a shit about.

1. There'd be familial enemies and allies, perhaps going back generations. 

2. There would always be people seeking to curry favor with the family, either as patrons, customers, or allies in a conflict 

3. It was very common in the old days for aristocrats to receive both exotic gifts and to send their children to far off places for schooling or training, or to have highly-skilled tutors for them

4. The rich are often taken with fads and eccentricities, and are known to do things "just because they can" (like the Folly Towers)

<TEXT> jesus christ, someone backed over their own baby in their driveway? That's appalling, i can only imagine the disgusting and awful scene that must have presented. I dunno about locked up (without knowing more about the situation), but they should definitely be carefully examined to determine if they were negligent or not. 

And if there's issues with the foster care system, we should be working towards *fixing those issues* rather than refusing to use the system.  </TEXT>

As to the repetition of stories, I'd say that, really, there's only about 7 to 10 real stories in all the world, and we just keep telling them over and over in different ways with minor variations. If there's a truly unique story to be told - I've never heard it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> culturally catastrophic to have the ephemera of a previous century squatting possessively on the cultural stage and refusing to allow this surely unprecedented era to develop a culture of its own, relevant and sufficient to its times.

I think this shows a supreme misunderstanding of what 21st century culture is: it's less a "let's invent new art!" and more a "let's remix and reimagine previous art in ways that were not conceived of when it was made." 

I guarantee you if you showed early comics creators something like Flashpoint Paradox or Gods and Monsters, they'd be totally aghast and state that they have nothing to do with such a vile thing. 

That said, Moore has always been a bit of a curmudgeon (to put it mildly!) and his work controversial. It's kind of his thing to be controversial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We could start treating driving as a privilege (which it is) instead of as a right (Which it is not), and tell people that there's now zero tolerance for DUI. You drive drunk, no license for you, ever, with absolutely zero tolerance. Get caught driving without a license, 20 years in lockup, no parole. 

in 2013, *10 thousand fucking people* died in america due to drink driving. More than three 9/11's. Hitting some drunk with a thousand dollar fine and a slap on the wrist isn't cutting it. We need to treat drunk driving as the serious public health risk it is.

And before any drunk-splainers show up to say how it'd "ruin some poor guy's life" to not be able to drive around, tough shit. The thousands of dead people's lives are gone, not ruined, and them and their loved ones the people you should be concerned for, not drunks. </TEXT>

1. His parents had some kind of magic worked on him before he was born, that made him as he is in terms of being able to do magic. If this is intentional or not is up to you.

2. He was kidnapped by a (evil? merely insane?) wizard and experimented on, leaving him changed in a fundamental way. His parents were able to have him rescued (or, he rescued himself, or they paid a ransom, or what have you)

3. A god/demon blessed/cursed him for some sacrilege or heresy or offering. This should be a huge deal, something that totally changed his entire life and existence. It'd be something the character would have a borderline obsession with.

4. Alternatively, if he's rich enough, he might have just bought or had made an elixir by some alchemist.

5. A mysterious artifact of questionable origin makes him able to do magery, and without it he is powerless. The unusual background would be how he got that artifact, discovered it's powers, etc.

The key would be to add some flavor to it through quirks or actual disadvantages to offset it, though these need not be very game-changing. </TEXT>

Would you all like me to do a quiz for every episode that airs (which would be a LOT of quizzes in a very short time!) or would you like me to do a big final quiz for the entirety of 14B? 

Bear in mind, if TeenNick/MTV Canada doesn't put the episodes online right away, this entire question is moot, of course. I only watch the show online. 

Anyway, I hope everyone's having a great summer and is looking forward to 14B. I know I am.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'd say the difficulty isn't in setting up the heroes (though some of them have pretty bizarre abilities if i remember right) but rather in capturing the "feel" of the game itself.

probably one of the few gurps scenarios that would need some amount of house ruling to deal with properly. Key elements would include summoning in "trash" monsters to kill, and the idea of the turrets. I'd expect the overall fight to be pretty short one way or the other unless you came up with some kind of rules-based respawn system.

That said i don't see any reason this couldn't work, though the trash mobs might present quite a bit of book-keeping and a bit of a balance issue (you need them to be tough enough to be a challenge, but not so tough as to be to hard to kill). A similar set of problems exist for the turrets - it'd be very easy for them to be incredibly lethal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think as a society we generally lack structure and purpose for people. I suspect many of our problems as a society stem from that issue of people just feeling lost and without real purpose or meaningful goals. 

Until we find a way to give (more) people goals and purpose in life, i suspect things won't much improve, no matter how hard we try to change our prison system or law enforcement techniques. The things that drive people to a *life* of crime are pretty well intractable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or, alternatively, prison just *isn't that bad* for the repeat offenders. They know people inside, it's a reasonably safe environment (from the perspective of murder, at any rate) and they know how to work within the confines of the system. If someone's spent most of his life in jail, going back probably doesn't seem so bad. 

Either way, even if tomorrow we instituted drastic changes in the system, there'd still be an enormous population of people damaged by the previous system, who would have to be dealt with in some way.  </TEXT>

I generally have zero hassles and zero bullshit in public because of that; people know i have nothing of value, and i look deranged enough that bothering me seems like more work than it's worth.

That said, i never make eye contact with anyone, i always act very evasive about it. I find it puts people on edge if you never look them in the eye. I also talk to quiet, so they have to strain to hear me and lean in, which also makes them uncomfortable. 

Concerning one's self with the comfort of others is the first step to making yourself vulnerable to the depredations of others.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> as to the platooning, me and a friend tried for *20 minutes* to get into a T-10 match platooned and couldn't do it; we had to play classic over and over instead of the proper game (which we very much wanted to play, for the team work!) 

it was very frustrating.  </TEXT>

2. There's really no reason to know why or for what cause someone put in the request, or even *who* really put in the request. For all we know this could be due to some privacy activism group going through the phonebook or sending in all their friends and family's names.  </TEXT>

1. People who are remotely understandable. They go after a 16 or 17 year old, and there's some kid of rational thought process involved.

2. People who are incomprehensible. Going after an 11 year old when you're 45 is just impossible for me to understand. There's no rationale there.

Either way damage is done to the young person, but in the second case it can be totally awful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oddly enough my first thought was that the world of the gunslinger would probably slot in almost perfectly with regular gurps, and require very few (if any) custom rules. 

A lot of the in universe stuff is purely fluff, with no in-game effects beyond the needs of the story. The Beams, the Ka-Tet - that's all just window dressing.

the universe hopping is trivial enough to set up with basic gurps rules (or be a purely narrative event). Rarely do the characters have any control over the more mystical events.

The rest of the stuff would just be setting up the various races, figuring out just *how* good the gun characters are (are they as god as nearly-god Roland, or are they merely skilled gunsmen?), and what kind of equipment they have.

I might house rule stuff about ammunition and supplies (since that's such a big part of the books) but beyond that i don't see any reason in particular to not just go with basic set + gun fu and maybe High Tech/ultratech (albeit the high-tech artifacts would be hyper-rare).

<TEXT> The CDC define [mental illness](http://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics.htm) as: 

Mental illness is defined as collectively all diagnosable mental disorders or health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning.

If some guy's fucking a corpse, that's a mental illness. Just because it's also a personality disorder (or whatever trendy bullshit the shrinks are saying now adays), does not mean it's not also a mental illness.

Also, the legal definition of insanity in terms of competency for trial is a totally separate issue from mental health. A person can be mentally healthy, but be found to have been out of control (due to a reaction to drugs, for example) at the time of a commission of a crime. It has more to do with how the person perceived the act they committed, rather than if they have a mental illness.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a joke, but it's a story, it has a joke in it, and other people thought it was funny at the time.

So i went to school in a pretty shitty rural area. My graduating class was like 40 people. "Judgmental" does not begin to describe the environment; every thing you did or said could and would be gossiped about. 

Almost every guy i knew had a circumcised dick. Just how it was. It was such a common thing that we didn't even think about it or consider it. 

So finally one day in 10th grade this dude - real hillbilly motherfucker - changes in gym class, and we see that he's *not* circumcised. For the next week, he was so tormented, so nightmarishly abused and mocked that he did the only thing he could do.

He circumcised his own prick, in his bathroom, with an x-acto knife.  There was blood on the *ceiling*. Of course he botched it and had to go to the hospital. He dropped out of school and, so far as i am aware, never graduated.

So the funny part, after the school hears about his desperate act we have a good chuckle at his expense, including mock re-enactments and tormenting his cousins about it. And then someone says:

"He HAD a freak dick, but now i bet he's got a *Frankenstein dick*!"

Cue laughter from all in attendance, and questions to his (female) cousin if she saw his "Frankenstein dick". 

Edit: Thanks for the Gilding!  </TEXT>

1. How was the weapon secured in the car?

2. Why was the weapon left unattended in the car?

3. What condition was the car in?

4. What efforts were made to track down the thieves?

<TEXT> People join gangs for as many reasons as there are people in gangs, but it usually boils down to:

1. Respect. People feel that by joining a gang, they'll have the respect of the people around them. 

2. Safety. It may be safer to be in a gang than to be on your own, in some high-gang activity areas.

3. Money. Gangs often are engaged in illegal business and make lots of money (or so they'd have you believe)

4. Power. Being in a gang you can have power over "the little people" around you. 

5. Family/friends involved. If your older brother's in a gang, it may seem like a good idea for you to join, too. 

That said, life in gangs is often brutish, unpleasant, very dangerous, and often ends up in little more than someone going to prison, getting shot, or having a lifetime of regrets. It's a bad deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always been a staunch supporter of captiol punishment, for a number of reasons. Foremost among them, there are some people who are - at a word - irredeemable. They commit crimes so awful that they cannot ever be trusted to return to society, they show no ability to ever be rehabilitated. 

Keeping such a person locked up removes them from threatening society, but it does nothing to prevent them harming other prisoners (who may have committed quite minor offenses), it does nothing to prevent them influencing people on the outside (this woman could seek to contact her living children, for example), it does nothing to stop them escaping (as those two killers in new york did recently). 

If a person cannot be redeemed and cannot rejoin society, then the best thing for everyone is an execution; it limits their suffering and it protects everyone from further harm.

I think this is probably the most i've ever written about my thoughts on the matter at one time, hah.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Incompetence to stand trial is (perhaps ironically) not really about mental health: it's about mental *state*. Someone can be totally batshit crazy, and so long as they realize what they are doing is wrong and a crime at the time they do it, they are mentally competent to stand trial.

One advantage of the competency system is that when we find someone to be incompetent to stand trial, it's pretty non-controversial - [Just check out this guy, for example](http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/01/immigrant_from_mexico_who_speaks_aztec_language_declared_mentally_incompetent_to_stand_trial_in_2011.html)  </TEXT>

Actually true story: yesterday i went to wendies, and they were (evidently) training a new girl at how to be a Wendies worker. So my g/f gets a Frosty. The new girl kind of heaped it up a bit (so it looked like an ice cream cone). No shit, the manager told her that was to much to put in there and that it should be level with the cup and to remember for next time. Right in front of us, no less. 

I almost thought about bitching to corporate about it, but decided not to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's alot of "might" and "maybe" and it presupposes that the intelligence we create is both able to be modified in such a way, that we'd have the know-how to do it, and that it isn't able to bypass it by some means. That's a tremendous, enormous risk. 

I'd honestly rather have an AI that had zero safety precautions in it than one with half-assed ones, because the one with zero we at least *accept and know* is dangerous. It's just like how bicycle helmets increase injury: if you think you're safe, you take unnecessary risks. 

It also, of course, presupposes that we're not stupid enough to have it accidentally destroy us with our own, perfectly reasonable requests. Which i have no faith in, personally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that - among all the literary genres - horror is the most flexible and most pliable in terms of format. That said, i think most creepy pastas are basically in the same vein as lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness" - a "true account" from the perspective of someone who's discovered something abnormal and either wants to document it or warn others off.

The other big format would probably be the "letters" format - where people communicate back and forth about some strange happening. 

both are pretty venerable formats, although updated to the modern age in the form of web pages and text messages instead of scientific journal entries and letters mailed back and forth. </TEXT>

First, most biker hits are loud, messy, and obvious. Biker gangs survive on fear, so they tend to not be very subtle in how they kill people. They'd mow her down in a public place or fire bomb her house or something, not just shoot her in the head on a quiet road. 

Second, how would they know where to find her to do the hit? 

Third, if they were tied up with a gang enough to get killed over it, you'd think there'd be some mention of that somewhere. It's not something they could keep quiet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a few things.

Firstly, it sets up a divide between gun owners: sporting users and self-defense users. divisiveness is not something to be fostered.

Secondly, it opens the door to excluding or limiting weapons based on their (perceived) sporting use. Anything that places a limit on the type and form of firearm that can be made or sold is inherently wrong. </TEXT>

I'm not particularly surprised no one got involved - it happened very fast. And, I'm not sure that getting out of your car to get involved in an altercation like that is the right choice; what if it was a setup to steal a car by luring someone out of it and just hopping in and driving off? </TEXT>

[This is a fairly recent study on it](http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2012.pdf) - PDF Warning.

I think the most important thing to take out of that is this line, though:

"Currently, no comprehensive national database or tracking system exists to systematically document the toll in death and injury of murder-suicide in the United States."

as to gender breakdown, though:

Of the 378 homicides, 288 victims were female, 89 victims were male, and the gender of one victim was not identified.

 the Calypso was in the Singapore harbor when a barge accidentally rammed into it, sinking the boat to the seafloor. It took days to bring it to the surface 

I mean the boat's been severely damaged, sank, stripped of it's entire outer hull. All that's left is the inner frame and a few parts. I'm not sure that you could call it "The Calypso" and be honest if it was restored - it'd practically be a new ship! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that it's always possible for people to go to far with anything. 

On the other hand, if a case does not get media attention, does not get people involved, then it is very possible for it to simply fade into the background for years as new cases come up and leads dry up.

I think Natural Born Killers said it best: "The media is like the weather, only it's man-made weather." - and online sleuthing is certainly a type of media.  

As an aside, i'm both surprised that the Jessica Chambers case has gone unsolved this long, and that it's not much more popular in the media. She fits their ideal of a victim: young, blonde, american, pretty.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some thoughts on each entry:

1. amusingly, clive barker's "Scarlet Gospels" have totally and utterly confused the issue of who pinhead is and what he wants.

2. Peter Watts did a great short story called "The Things" that talks about the mindset of the creature, and how it is, in truth, just doing what it does and isn't really evil per se. My own favorite theory is that the time in the ice gave it brain damage, and it was operating at a much reduced, bestial capacity; it's normal mode of operation must have been much higher, to build spaceships and all.

3. Dekker's kind of a mixed bag as a villian. On the one hand he's definitely evil, on the other hand that evil is serving a slightly greater good (for the moment, at least).

4. the Predator (or Yautja) are actually text-book evil to me. Their totally selfish, self-centered, and ignorant to the validity of other ways of living and other lives. 

5. Vampires have always been sort of the prototype "monster-victim". Their monsters, yes - but only because of circumstance. Of course, they can embrace their dark nature. One thing i liked about the Twilight franchise is that it shows two types of vampires: those that sort of accept this "gift" and fit in with humans as best they can, and those that just go full on psycho-dark.  </TEXT>

And certainly we were traitors to the throne of britain; I consider it a necessary and just betrayal, but a betrayal none the less. For that reason i'd not expect britain to build monuments to our great revolutionary war heroes, nor would i expect them to name buildings after them! Actually i gather that in the UK, the revolution is small potatoes because at that time in history britain was involved in a much larger conflict, and it was basically a footnote in that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could see a few situations that might lead to it. One would be if the catholic church was, genuinely, threatened by some external force - perhaps if terrorists targeted many priests in europe and abroad. In that case the "crusade" might be in the form of guards for churches and priests, rather than a traditional one.

Another big one might be if a country launched an attack on the vatican, and (for whatever reason) the rest of the world refused to sanction them for it. A firebrand pope (or one who was deranged because of the attack) could call for it. 

It'd be a big (even huge) deal, and not something the church would take lightly, or that the world would sit idly by for. The only question would be if anyone cared enough to try and stop them (or if the risks of stopping them outweighed the likelyhood of further uprisings). 

Intriguingly, there are still a few knight orders left - the [Knights Hospitaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller) are still kicking around, along with [a few others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_order_(monastic_society%29#List_of_military_orders) - they could see a resurgence (and rearming). 

As a side note, if a group as disordered as islam can have *several* on-going, persistent military operations, someone as organized as the catholic church could certainly manage one. </TEXT>

People would answer. How many and of what quality i couldn't venture a guess, but people would answer. Probably enough to mount a fairly serious expedition somewhere; definitely enough to run a guerrilla war.

if they could get a country on board (say, brazil or italy) they could do some *serious* damage to someone.

<TEXT> this sounds a lot like "imposter syndrome". You feel like you haven't earned your success. But i would say that since you *are* successful, you are competent and skilled in your area.

Besides - how would anyone ever find out if you *weren't* competent? If you made a mistake, you could always just blame it on external circumstances or a misunderstanding.

I guess what i'm trying to say is: Relax and enjoy the life you have, you know? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If we're to have private prisons at all (and i don't think we should) we should just pay them a flat rate (to keep the facility staffed and running) + a per-prisoner rate. So if it's a 500 bed facility and has 1 prisoner in it, that's fine, and if it's a 500 bed facility and it has 500 prisoners in it, that's fine.

Why it would not be set up that way is baffling to me, but i suspect the general incompetence and ignorance of state legislatures is to blame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's the exact opposite: people want non-threatening things. Let's say someone has a crush on suzy at works, and as any good man would, beats the bishop thinking about her. That's dangerous ground: his fantasy life could intrude into his work life and make him feel bad because he can't have what he wants.

But if he wants, someone *utterly* unattainable - his mother, a MLP character, etc - then that's safe to fantasize about because he knows it'll have to stay a fantasy forever. </TEXT>

I'm guessing B, here - the guy knew/thought once he was in custody, they'd either get him on a much more serious charge, or he knew that if found guilty he'd spend many years in prison due to priors or something.

Either way - i don't think he'll be free for much longer. They tend to round up cop killers pretty fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, he has not even the slightest most remote hope of an insanity defense. Hell, he does not seem very concerned with even mounting a defense, honestly.

Secondly, considering he's already said he was trying to start a race war, if the media hasn't caught on by now it's intentionally not catching on. Hoping that throwing another log onto the pile will change their minds is a lost hope. 

Thirdly, i really could give a fuck less what this asshole's motives and inspirations supposedly are. He's just another inbred hick with a gun that figured his only chance at getting anyone to pay attention to him was to go kill some innocent people. Just like those assholes Klebold and Harris, just like that prick tim McVey, just like all the rest of them. 

Give him the death penalty and then lock'em away until it's time to give him the shot. He has nothing worthwhile to tell us. </TEXT>

The officer fires one shot at the dog, misses the dog and accidentally shoots a four-year-old in the leg, CPD spokeswoman, Denise Alex-Bouzounis, said.

There was no person attacking him. he claimed the dog charged him and he drew and fired his weapon, hitting a 4 year old.

<TEXT> I would argue that's more just a difference of extent and opportunity. 

I think it's pretty telling that the klan wore masks. They knew what they were doing was wrong, but they also knew that if they took some precautions they were unlikely to be punished. That enabled the violence and the intimidation. 

The only difference with internet groups is that they have less opportunity to do wrong and it's easier to figure when they have done wrong (see: reddit + the boston bomber fiasco). it makes them seem less prone to extremism and violence, but really it's just muted because of the fear of consequences and the lack of opportunity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That plan has a few (reasonably minor) flaws:

1. It'd scatter infectious material everywhere. If anyone has any open wounds or if there's bone shards, it could infect them with the zombie-agent.

2. It'd be noisy, which could draw unwanted attention/deafen people nearby who need their ears to hear shuffling undead approach

3. Someone could be close to the victim (rendering aid, checking to see if their just unconscious or what) when the charge goes off, injuring them quite severely

4. No system is 100% fail-safe, and an accidental detonation could be absolutely catastrophic - imagine if they were flying a helicopter or driving at speed. 

No; implanting explosives inside people is only rarely the correct answer, and it's not in this case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> that too. 

At one point, we had an intermittent server fault where the server would just die and then pop back. So we finally trace it down to a dude's quarry system: it was running intermittently, and when it would run, it would bring down the entire server as processed stuff.  He couldn't power it consistently (thus the bursts - he'd shut it off, let the power build up, turn it on, bring the server to it's knees, it'd run it's power dry, rinse and repeat).  </TEXT>

The revelant portion:

(B) No person shall knowingly transport or have a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle in such a manner that the firearm is accessible to the operator or any passenger without leaving the vehicle.

(C) No person shall knowingly transport or have a firearm in a motor vehicle, unless the person may lawfully possess that firearm under applicable law of this state or the United States, the firearm is unloaded

<TEXT> Incredibly enough, i found that replacing AE2 with Project E was net-beneficial for the server over a long period of time:

1. People didn't feel a need to "hold onto" literally millions of cobble /sand/gravel/etc for no discernible reason

2. People didn't have enormous AE systems running 24/7 dealing with enormous feed stock inputs and processing systems. I did not realize how much of a drag on a server this was until we didn't have to deal with it anymore.

We just dumped stuff into the ProjectE network and pulled stuff out as necessary. It totally liberated us from the enormous drag of the usual midgame (or, as i like to call it "build giant quarries and enormous mob traps, then profit!"). 

The end effect was pretty much identical to AE ("oh, i need 1024 diamonds...better pull those out of storage!") but without any of the overhead or annoyances of the AE-type systems. 

It's not for everyone (and notably, i think most servers would want to turn off the automatic generation of points) but it definitely was very enjoyable and very liberating when we did it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> no joke: I played an MMO with a dude who was, 99% of the time, totally great. Real team player, friendly as the day is long, self-sacrificing to help other people. Top-Notch human being, he'd keep playing on raids and shit till he *passed out on the keyboard* rather than let the team down.

but then there was the 1% of the time that that girls + games came up, and he went completely off the deep end. His attitude was exactly that girls played games for attention, unfairly benefited from attention, and generally should be avoided for the sake of a good experience. 

Trying to talk to him about it was like talking to a brick wall, so after a while we all just learned to ignore it/never bring it up. </TEXT>

For one thing, how would the would-be thief make his escape? he has to get onto the bike and turn it on, and that would likely entail turning away from the bikers to do so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a few tricks.

First rule is to remember FORD, which is great for any situation: 

1. Family/Friends
2. Occupation (fuckers love talking about their job/profession)
3. Recreation (what do they like to do for fun?)
4. Dreams (What do they want to be doing?) 

Second rule is to remember GRAPES, which should never be talked about in polite company:

1. Guns
2. Religion
3. Abortion
4. Politics
5. Economics
6. Sexuality

Third rule is: Always have a smile. Act like you're having a grand time even if it's boring as fuck. People like happy people, even if it's a facade.

Fourth rule: Observe them closely. This takes practice, but over time you can gauge out how their reacting to you and adjust accordingly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [There was a scandal about this around six months ago](http://fox8.com/2015/01/29/how-much-first-aid-training-does-cleveland-provide-its-police-officers-i-team-investigation/)

From the article:

Akron, Columbus, and Cleveland all offer 12 hours of first-aid training to their academy recruits. Thats mandated by the state of Ohio. By comparison, Boston said its recruits receive 40 hours of first-aid training, and Pittsburgh said its recruits receive 56 hours.

Even more damning:

Boston also said its officers must be re-certified in first-aid skills during various times during their careers. Pittsburgh said officers there receive refresher courses every two years.

Ive been a police officer for 22 years, Loomis said, and we had one in-service training (in Cleveland) in 2009.

the tl;dr is: Cleveland has absolute shit for first aid training for it's cops, and it is not surprising they had no clue how to handle a gunshot wound.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
The Winter Finale is here! The Dreaded Sandwich Maker! Easiest Cellphone Disarm in History! I'm starting to feel genuine sympathy for Mr. Hollingsworth - it keeps raining bricks on him. 

1. Aside from the domestic violence, who's more right - Miles or Mr. Hollingsworth - when it comes to how important being elected mayor is? 
2. Is Eli actually unstable and unreliable? 
3. Is Miles just as messed up as his father?
4. Could Becky just walk onto the team and do the routine like that? 
5. Is miles being the "Arsonist" another unneeded twist?
6. Is Frankie right about how the girls will abandon Zoe after powercheer is over? 
7. Eli and Clare return: is it all-clear or a disaster in the making? 

And a bonus question: what'd ya'll think of Season 14 so far?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hidden ICarly Reference!!!! Dream Sequence! I'm starting to feel like the most beleagured character on degrassi is actually Mr. Hollingsworth. 

1. On a scale of 1-10 how ironic is it that Degrassi has a teen character try to tell an older character how to appeal to teenagers?
2. Why is Zig not in trouble for not wearing a shirt in school?
3. Is it awesome that they made a reference to the original degrassi? 
4. Winston as blackmailer: plausible or WTF?
5. Is Zig amazing for standing up for Zoe against the rival cheer captain? 
6. Is Zoe right that she has more to lose than Frankie?
7. Should Frankie want to make Zoe pay?

I'd first like to say that though i bitch about triles, it's refreshing to see a tv show that treats a gay relationship just like every other relationship on the show. 

An episode full of pain and suffering for everyone.

1. Is Tristan a sucker for going back to Miles after how Miles has treated him?
2. Zig: Should Zoe get with him?
3. What's more unlikely: That Alli would blow Clare's secret, or that there'd only be one girl Alli knew who was pregnant in highschool?
4. Is the Zoe-Hunter storyline a commentary on the ineffective nature of harsh interrogation techniques? 
5. Is it wrong of Alli to use having or not having sex as a punishment against Dallas?
6. Is Zoe the villain of this story arc? 
7. Why would the principal assume that Zoe was behind degrassi nudes, instead of it being a specious accusation or being done without her knowledge by the other cheerleaders? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Least favorite character in degrassi history: Grandma Baker. Mini-Morning Cakes: Best name ever for Muffins! Becky: Standing up for herself in public! 

A little bit of a surprise for Clare. 

1. Why did it take this long for someone who would report degrassi nudes to find out about degrassi nudes? 
2. Does this episode totally nuke the blackmail plot? 
3. Why was imogen not at all punished for carrying around and displaying child pornography in a school? 
4. Will there ever be a problem that Maya and/or Miles does not make worse through their own poor choices?
5. Is Imogen right about jack cheating? 
6. Is "Clare is living proof!" the best burn of the year?
7. What will Clare Do? 

All told a pretty good episode, lots of action.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The return of singing to degrassi! Degrassi continues to be totally predictable like a comforting old friend! Miles is amazing looking in uniform! Miles crushing Tristan's heart! Jonah is bigger than he looks (he's Drew-sized!)

1. Why does the cheer squad think that finding the blackmailer will prevent them from continuing?
2. Is Drew's jealousy justified? 
3. Why do they continue to use grace as super-hacker (that's not even how cell tower triangulation WORKS!) instead of just writing sensibly? All answers accepted.
4. Is Lola adorable or annoying when she talks?
5. Is Miles' problem pot or that his friends are crazy enough to throw an intervention for pot? 
6. Did Miles make the right choice to leave the accident scene? 
7. Since hunter is (evidently) not the blackmailer, who is? 

The thing with Grace literally upset me. It's gotten to the point now where it's damaging the show's reputation; what is it, some kind of half-assed teenaged CSI?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Best line of the season: "Our cupcakes are very good, sir!" 

1. Is this the first blackmail plot in degrassi history? 
2. Is it good to see Alli and Dallas again, or is it still to soon? 
3. Is Tristan a bad influence on Miles?
4. Does Miles having an actual problem dilute the meaning of Maya's storyline?
5. Is Dallas right to question Alli's commitment to him in light of her not being willing to have sex with him? 
6. Is Miles smoking marijuana, or a magical drug that turns you into an asshole? 
7. What should the Power Cheer Squad Do? 

Kind of a mixed bag of an episode. I found the Alli-Dallas plot a little to pat and a little to perfect. Loved the power cheer arc though - Very Excited for next week's episode!  </TEXT>

1. Does maya need serious psychiatric help?
2. Is it surprising frankie would be this moral and upstanding?
3. Is Hunter right to be upset that no one defended his sister on the team?
4. is imogen's inability to handle polyamory directly related to her inability to notice 10 other people standing in a small room with her?
5. Does anyone else find it incredibly immersion breaking every time they "hack" a computer?
6. Jack and Imogen: best couple on the show or best couple anywhere?
7. Is it refreshing that Hunter (the seeming psycho) is a nice guy, while Maya (the cute girl) is a raving psycho?

All told a really fun episode! I am glad they at least touched on polyamory, if they backed away from it in the end. Look forward to hearing what you all think. 

edit: as an aside "in four colors!" is a comic book reference. </TEXT>

Every time grace talks about computers my inner dev writhes in agony. "Sure, let me do a few weeks worth of development time in a few hours, no problem. "

1. Which is worse: making homobphobic jokes, or assuming miles is just "going through a stage"?
2. Zoey: sliding into madness, or already a legitimate lunatic?
3. Has any writer on the show ever actually used an online dating srevice?
4. When did this show completely go off the rails to the point where it has a legitimate plot about the creation of a for-profit child porn distribution service?
5. Is the rubber room teacher the best teacher at degrassi?
6. Is Miles justified in being upset at Maya developing OCD about his safety and well-being?

<TEXT> Miles making a horrible choice! The return of Grace, speaking truth as always! "Like I Care" should be the Maya catchphrase of the season. Becky whipping out the interrogation techniques! Maya looking like someone's twisting a knife in her at seeing people experience joy!

Usually i struggle to come up with seven good questions, this time i struggled to come up with only seven.

1. Who will long-term win the Machiavellian game between Miles and his father?
2. Why is no one freaking out at Zig getting naked pictures of 9th grade girls?
3. Is Drew making the right choice to be involved? 
4. Has Zoe truly put the baggage of the past behind her, or is she merely putting up a strong front?
5. Mike Dallas: Best Teen-Dad or overly judgemental? 
6. Should Becky have stood by drew, or is how she's acting totally reasonable considering?
7. Are Zoe and Zig truly done, or will it be resurrected? 

I look forward to hearing what you all think, and towards the next episode!  </TEXT>

Author's note: I really honestly didn't know what to even do for this quiz. the whole damn episode was 100% serious, and i'm not a 100% serious kind of 

guy. I fully expect that there'll be stuff i can't cover in 7 questions that people will want to talk about, so consider this a free-for-all.

1. is anyone surprised there's no graduation at the end of this season? 

2. Is drew a tragic or heroic figure?

3. Is tristan's affection creepy and overly intense? 

4. Who should Zig go after, Maya or Zoe? 

5. Should everyone who gets to know Miles run for the hills? 

6. Is Eli the ultimate chess-master?

7. What should clare do about her condition? 

I still want to know if that is tristan's natural hair color or if he's the most dedicated hair-dyer in history.

1. Is it surprising that zig was in the gang dealing drugs *before* he got kicked out on the street?

4. Is drew's suddenly acting with sense satisfying, or unlikely?

5. Would the situation with becky be different if the genders were switched? (ie, if some guy went and stalked a girl he met on an online game)

6. Will Double D be the new meeting place for degrassi people post senior year?

7. Is becky's mother deluded or actually evil? 

I look forward to hearing what you all think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They should have named this episode Some variation of "Awkward". It was full of (sometimes painfully) awkward moments. And a rare Jenna-Connor appearance! And Hollingsworth's wife saying "aboot". 

Personal note: the video game sequences made me want to tear out my eyes. Repeatedly. 


1. Is Dallas a wise man for avoiding the drama, or should he support Drew more? 

2. Has Imogen's parents both being very intelligent and forward-thinking tainted her view of all parents to make her think they'll be as reasonable?

3. Do most people think drew is stupid or just really unlucky, or some kind of combination of both? 

4. Should Becky be more understanding of her brother's situation and at least try to see it from his side?

5. Did they literally invent the most generic computer game and gamers in history for this episode?

6. Does Drew look different when he works at Mr. Hollingsworth or is it just me?

7. Has Zig's storyline gone from compelling to incredibly boring? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kind of a mixed bag to me. I didn't like that Tiny turned out to be a Nice Guy; i didn't like that everything got tied up so neatly. Some fun moments, though, to be sure.

1. Has anyone ever mentioned that Zig's family is from Serbia before!? 

2. Tristan: Speaking good sense about telling miles, or hopelessly idealistic?

3. Art show idea: Pretty cool or chance for writers to be stupid?

4. Is the zig storyline resolved annoyingly quickly?

5. Is it the single most hypocritical thing ever on degrassi for Alli to lecture anyone on boys? 

6. Is it awesome when the writers break the 4th wall by using fandom names for pairings, or is it merely amazing?

7. Why is a song about how much you hate someone grounds for suspension, but throwing an axe at someone's picture merely cathartic?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And we're back! I absolutely adore the shirt grace is wearing in the first scene. They actually admit what season it is (Spring time). Tristan may be a redditor - he wears a fedora?

1. Does degrassi have far to many extracurricular clubs for it's student population?

2. Is springtime in Toronto nice enough to go swimming in a lake - bear in mind, they say that spring just started?

3. Is Maya the most absolutely hopelessly naive character currently on the show?

4. Why is Zig so bad at insulting people? 

5. Is tristan's line ("Oh my Ganja") the best line of the entire premier? 

6. Is Chewy the worst kind of geeky guy?

7. Is it incredibly relieving to have someone who actually says "guys suck" to one of the people who needs that message most?

All told, a really good start to the season! I look forward to the next episode, and what you all think of this one.

It's good to be back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tristan and Zoe made me genuinely lol. The reference to a "horse drawn carriage" is pretty amusing, to - because is that not JUST what eli did? Zig is serious romantic competition for anyone on the show. That last scene was pretty amazing.

1. Was Maya wrong to not tell Miles about Zig moving in with her before it happened?

2. Becky: did she get the best possible resolution to her situation?

3. Zig: Still in love, or just pissed that someone has maya and he doesn't?

<TEXT> Extra Long episode!!!!!!! Will maintain at 7 questions though, because Tradition. This episode had several "special" features - including "camera vision" and zoe having flashbacks. Kind of wierd, not sure i liked that. Also the copy i watched (on teen nick) had some annoying skips, so, if i missed some massive plot point: that's why. 

1. Why are there so many rarely seen people in this episode? First mile's sister's twin brother, and Becky's brother!? And that random girl that showed up for dance practice with Zoe and Mile's Sister? Zig and Grace? 

2. When did Imogen become the voice of moderation and reason, concerned with rocking the boat?

3. Was the overall message of the episode well-managed? 

4. Does this episode fall into the "communication trap" - where the problems would all go away if people just meaningfully communicated with each other, without fear or prejudice?

5. Who the hell is the short-haired judge at the sing off? 

6. Is Miles a sociopath or merely an idiot?

7. Is it a total cop-out to have a throw away character be the guy ~~who shot Mr. burns~~ assaulted Zoe?

All told i really liked this episode and think it was pretty well done and entertaining! Look forward to hearing what all of you think :) </TEXT>

1. Is this the first ever degrassi dream sequence? 

2. Would drew be so easily misled, or teen drama bullshit?

3. Why does rocky have his own cellphone?

4. Maya: reasonable voice of wisdom, or miserable party-pooper? 

5. Leo-Dallas: Perfect, or Unsatisfying?

6. What does everyone think of the continuing slow slouch towards Claire-Drew?

<TEXT> Is this the episode where they remind us they have people like Connor and Winston still on staff? And let's not forget little Rocky! I'm a little baffled what time of year it is on Degrassi.

Also, Mrs. Hollingsworth's necklace during the confrontation scene was amazing.

I gotta say, i genuinely liked this episode and really enjoyed it. The beginnings of Clew, some great Alli-Dallas moments, and all the Miles drama. Episode was even uploaded to teennick in a hurry. 

I can't help but feel this may mark the second episode of a return to a more classic-feeling degrassi.

On with the quiz.

1. Should miles try harder to win over his father? Or should his father be more understanding of his son? After all, their family, regardless.

2. Maya: What happened to her new look? 

3. Mr. Hollingsworth's (not-quite-confirmed) affair: Shocking Scandal, or disappointingly mundane?

4. Alli: Finally making the right choices, or misisng out on a great opportunity?

5. Car changing scene: Touchingly romantic or Awkwardly Forced and contrived?

6. Miles: Will this make him cynical and jaded, or will he maintain his innocence a bit longer?

7. Dallas: is he about to go beat a frenchman named Leo?  </TEXT>

1. Zoe: Overly clingy, or attentive, caring girlfriend?

2. Is Imogen (and the dress code situation) a commentary on modern activism?

3. Jenna: Worst friend ever, or merely emotionally disabled?

4. Drew: Biggest asshole on earth or merely stressed out highschool senior? 

5. Ali and Mike Dallas: best partners/friends ever, or start of another Alli Mistake?

6. Hollingsworth: Great boss, or ulterior motives?

<TEXT> Poker game was my favorite part of the season so far. Teennick continues to disappoint with technical problems. 

1. Drew's exchange with Zoe about Dallas being a good kisser: throw out to the fans or throw-away statement? 

2. Imogen braless in class: Is she that clueless, or fanservice?

3. Drew: Is it wise to threaten Miles with blackmail like that in his own home? Will it have repercussions?

4. Is it better to have fun building a volcano, or to stress yourself out doing research about cancer and organic food?

5. Drew: Is he in so far over his head he'll never see daylight, or getting his just desserts?

6. Imogen: Fighter for justice, or over-reacting nutbar?

7. Zoe-Drew: Is the age difference really that big a deal?

I really enjoyed this episode, and look forward to hearing what you all think about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What an amazing episode! We have Maya trying to fit in with people she's barely ever around, we have Grace with a speaking role, the beginnings of a (presumably) ill-fated Drew-Zoe hookup, and of course the token appearance by Tristan doing makeup. All told, not a bad episode at all.

I have to say as an aside that the previews for the season kind of ruin the zoe-drew thing for me. Maybe i'm just reading to much into it though. 

Anyway, on with the quiz-questionnaire!! 

1. Rubber room: Realistic or bizarre teen-drama trope? 

2. Maya's New Look: Awesome or awful? 

3. Is Maya's response to the rubber room a result of being in a stressful situation or the result of her wanting to win Zig back? 

4. Zoe: Is her hooking up with drew a power move, or does she genuinely like him, or both? 

5. Neck-Bruise: is it the next cuckoo-bananas? Can it please BE the next cuckoo-bananas?

6. Gun: Cruelest prank or funniest prank?

7. Rubber-room kids: Disturbingly harmless, or refreshingly naughty? 

I look forward to seeing your (always insightful and often witty) answers!  </TEXT>

So we have the Bandhari Beatdown! The Drew Shoot Down! The Return of Alli's Parents! The Worst birthday surprise in history! The deepest hole ever dug by lies! 

On with the quiz! 


1. Why did Alli's mother immediately abscond with the coffee, not even giving any to Alli? 

2. Why did they not do a scene of drew arguing for a live monkey mascot? It would have owned! 

3. Zigs Return: Awesome or Awful!? 

4. Maya: Has anger issues, or justifiably upset at her (hithero unprecedented) treatment by the school?

5. Leo: Was he actually trying to do the right thing, breaking up with Alli? Or was it just one more manipulation? 

6. Is it just me or is Jenna looking a little rough?

7. Wedding Day Beat-Down: Over the top or awesome drama?


So what'd we all think? A suitable return for Degrassi? I'm eager to hear your thoughts. </TEXT>

If i mouse over something and hit "u" it shows me the recipes it's used in, and the same goes for if i hit "r" (It'll show me the recipe, i mean). The NEI interface is all there, it just displays no items to the right hand side.

Is there any known fix for this? Is it even a known problem? Any help would be much appreciated.

1. Is the switch from serious interpersonal issues to totally banal high school drama jarring or welcome?

2. Eli: is his transition from dedicated boyfriend to distracted college student realistic, or merely set up? 

3. Should tristan just own what people perceive him as (and play to his strengths), or should he continue to try and break type?

4. Winston: Why does he pick now to suddenly start interacting? The dudes' been barely there the entire season; suddenly he cares about things?

5. Is tristan legitimately short-sighted enough to think that being in a *performing group* is the sort of thing someone can keep secret from their best friend?

2. Long-distance relationships, will it work for Clare and Eli? He looks like might have a distraction (the kind who throws inflatable balls and watches new wave cinema)

3. Articles about Zoe: would clare be better off telling the truth (that Zoe's an ego-manical, self-promoting liar) or telling a glamorous but untruthful story? What would old clare do? Would Zoe even do an interview if she knew how clare...was? 

4. What magazine editor gives a highschool kid less then a day to write an entire article with interview? Will the magazine ever be seen again?

5. Clare: Harmless side effect, or lethal illness return? 

6. Is Miles father actually abusive or does he merely have high expectations?

7. Is Zoe's character a direct reflection of the writers frustrations with various actresses on the show throughout the years, or is she merely a trope... or is she both?

<TEXT> Kind of a mixed bag, episode wise. We see Zoe at her worst, Drew at his (hopefully) lowest, Clare being Clare and Leo leading a dance revolution of a sort. 

On to our questions. 

1. Miles has a sister?!?!?

2. Why does clare get to wear the cute safety glasses?

3. Leo: Does he have a point, or does he deserve the hate?

4. Is drew seriously wandering around with a harem of young girls doing his dirty work?

5. Zoe: Literally turning drew into a whore for drugs. I cannot even think of a question here; it's just so messed up.

6. Becky: Hiding her pain, or has she forgotten adam entirely? 

7. Will Zoe's Faux-Friendship with Maya turn authentic due to Maya's charm? Will the sun rise tomorrow? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So that happened. Stuffed-Friia asked me to do this weeks' quiz and discussion, so here it is.

1. Leo: Biggest disaster, or biggest disaster ever?

2. Zoe: Secrets and instability; is she the new fiona?

3. Clare: Can't handle being shut down. Will she stand for it or give up? Where is Eli?

4. Alli: Worst decision maker, or worst decision maker ever?

5. Text Memorial Assembly: Cunning aversion of expected behavior, or are they just setting us up for a much bigger event later?

6. Why is degrassi's student council so large? The UN has smaller committees then them.

7. Drew: should he stop taking his medicine, or keep taking it for the action it's now caused in his life, including getting his dream beach party done and landing him a possible new tv-star girlfriend? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long-time reader, first time poster. It's not that creepy - but it's creepy.

So, few weeks ago, i'm sitting in my house - it's like 9 am. My dogs start barking, and someone knocks at the door. I open the door, and it's this little dude - acne scarred face, thin, nasty looking. I say "What's up?" he says "Im really hungry, can i have some food? Just canned goods or something?"

He's really polite, i mean REALLY polite, and he also asks me to fill a 1-gallon jug with water. I give him two cans of beans and fill his jug and tell him to have a nice day, and even have kind of a positive vibe about the whole situation - helping those in need and what not. Even make an FB post.

So, about two hours later he's back: asks for something "other then beans" and if i have a smoke. Still feeling generous i tell him i got some Zatarans, and offer them to him. He kind of invites himself in, and *scavs through my girlfriends ashtray* while he's talking to me, still real friendly and polite.

He steals (I can think of no better word - he took without asking, and sort of commented he was taking them) some cigarette butts, i give him some zatarans and 3 cans of coke, and he leaves. I figure that's the *definite* end of it, and am a little miffed he just invited himself in. 

The third time, he just let himself in and said "hey are you busy?" before i could even get out of my chair. At this point, he tells me his friend stole his coke and could he have another, and apologizes for bothering me.

At this point, i'm nervous. Anyone who'll just blow into your house is a little off, and this guy's giving me the crazy vibe pretty strong. He's also totally not intimidated by me, which is unusual, and he's also acting like we're friends or something, which is even stranger.

So i give him a coke, tell him not to bother me again, and close the door behind him and lock it. I'm pretty well convinced if he walks into my house without me there he'll rob it just because he's so familiar with it.

Three days (of me locking my doors and living in paranoia) later, he shows up again. I tell him, exactly: "Fuck Off" when i open the door, and slam it in his face. 

A few hours later i'm outside and he walks by and sort of makes an apology to me for bothering me and then just keeps on walking.

It turns out (From  3rd party), he was the brother of a friend of my brothers. I hadn't seen him in so long that his new appearance (emaciated and sickly) was shocking, and he was, in fact, mentally unbalanced. 

Hopefully he leaves us alone now, but I'll still be locking my doors when i leave the house unattended.  </TEXT>
