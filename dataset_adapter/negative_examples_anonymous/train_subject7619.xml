<TEXT> I'm with you because you came to the right conclusion, but you got there the wrong way, both anecdotal and mistaking weather for climate. 

Weather is obviously an effect of climate and affected *by* climate, but weather  climate. 

I'm only cautioning this kind of statement because someone like me, a New Englander, can point to our horrendous 2014/2015 winter and say, "See? Climate change isn't real because it was really cold and snowed a lot." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. 20,000 years ago the temperature was some 8 to 10 C colder than it is today. But to draw a line from that point to today and say, "look, 20K years of global warming!" is dubious and arbitrary at best.

If you have look at [this graph of temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png), starting at a point when we were finishing the climb out of deep glaciation, you can clearly see that rapid warming ceased around 10,000 years ago (rapid relative to natural fluctuations, but not compared to the warming today, which is an order of magnitude faster). After a final little lift 8,000 years ago, temperature trended downward for the entire period of the Holocene. So the post-industrial revolution warming is the reversal of a many-thousand-year trend.

A closer look at [todays trend](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), within the context of the last [1,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png) and [2,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png) years, makes it even clearer that todays trend is striking  opposite to what one would expect without anthropogenic interference.

If you really want to play the global warming started X years ago game, you should talk about how were reversing a [5-million-year cooling trend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.png)  or go crazy and track global temperatures right back to the origins of the planet! Not that thered be much point

Fifty-five million years ago, a 5-degree Celsius rise in average global temperatures seems to have occurred in just 13 years, according to [a study published in the October 2013 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://phys.org/news/2013-10-climate-geological-instant.html). [A report in the August 2013 issue of Science revealed that in the near term, earth's climate will change 10 times faster than during any other moment in the last 65 million years.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130801142420.htm)

But I'm sure you know better than the overwhelming consensus of the world's climate scientists. Those guys don't know dick and you seem to have it all figured out. Bravo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The OP concerns what Arnold Schwarzenegger is saying, which is news/relevant because it's coming from a well-known Republican figurehead that is extremely popular on Reddit.

I could have chosen from roughly 50 sources; they all repeat what Arnold Schwarzenegger said verbatim or otherwise give excerpts. The source doesn't matter much when it comes to quoting what Arnold Schwarzenegger has to say.

Quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a big deal and the source is basically irrelevant. Dismissing climate change or its level of seriousness as "science fiction" warrants a source better than almost all the world's climate scientists' consensus on the matter.

The Cato Institute ain't it. </TEXT>

I doubt they're stupid. Like you say, most politicians hold high degrees from prestigious schools. They're educated men.

When politicians deny climate science, they're probably not doing it because they're stupid; they're doing it because businesses from whom addressing climate change would undermine their profits are literally paying them to.

The reason pro-business types and environmentalists often clash is because the two are often diametrically opposed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many men experience a less powerful urinary stream when emptying the bladder, as they get older.

It is estimated that something like 1 in 3 men over the age of 50 develop urinary outflow symptoms, which in the majority of cases is due to benign enlargement of the prostate gland, otherwise known as benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The gland gradually enlarges as the years go by, and this enlargement can cause pressure on the water pipe which runs from the bladder to the outside (the urethra), restricting the flow of urine in just the same way that water running through a hose is restricted if the hose is kinked or compressed.

Another cause of urinary flow restriction is a stricture in the urethra as a result of inflammatory scarring, perhaps as a result of a previous infection or operative catheterization.

My advice would be to go along and see your GP so that an examination of your prostate gland may take place.

Initially, examination with a gloved finger can determine whether the gland is physically enlarged, and a blood test known as a PSA (prostate specific antigen) can measure a chemical secreted by the prostate gland to ensure that any enlargement is benign.

If necessary, a rectal ultrasound test can be organized to further examine the interior of the gland non-invasively.

I strongly advise you not to delay seeking help, as there is much evidence that early treatment with medication can prevent the problem from becoming worse, and often delays the need for surgery in years to come.

At any rate, if you have noticed symptoms your prostate gland should be examined because prostate cancer, although an unlikely possibility in your case, is very much on the increase and is potentially very serious even in relatively young men like yourself.

Jesus does not put up with slacker fig trees.

^12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. ^13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. ^14 Then he said to the tree, May no one ever eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard him say it.

. . . 

^20 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. ^21 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!

<TEXT> /r/Showerthoughts loves Scooby Doo.

* Scooby-Doo taught us that the real monsters always turn out to be humans.

* The bad guys in Scooby-Doo never invoke their right to remain silent; they always confess their entire plans and motives after they're unmasked.

* The Scooby-Doo gang must spend a lot of time in court testifying against "bad guys."

* Scooby Doo's "accent" makes absolutely no sense. He's capable of making every sound a fluent English speaker can make, just as long as it's not at the beginning of the word.

* After the police arrest the villains in Scooby Doo, what do they charge them with?

* The bad guys on Scooby Doo could probably have made more money selling Halloween costumes than trying to pull off their scams.

* How come in Scooby Doo's Universe monsters and ghost are dismissed as hoaxes yet nobody bats an eye at the talking dog

* What if Scooby Doo and the gang are the real ghosts and can't rest until they solve the mystery of their own murder?

* Scooby Doo is CSI for kids.

* Some company in "Scooby-Doo" had to manufacture snacks specifically for Scooby's consumption.

* Scrappy-Doo is to Scooby-Doo what Jar Jar Binks is to Star Wars

* Why does Scrappy Doo talk in a normal human voice while Scooby talks in a dog voice?

* Scooby-doo villains had the best special effects talent of that time period and could have made their fortunes legally.

* What the fuck kind of name for a dog is "Scooby Doo"? 

* In "Scooby Doo" the gang isn't really solving mysteries about ghosts, ghouls, etc. They're actually just doing drugs with Shaggy in the Mystery Van and hallucinating their adventures.

<TEXT> I wish the 539 people who have commented ITT would read at least this much about the Infinite Monkey Theorem; it would end most of the arguments:

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

In this context, ***"almost surely" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning***, and ***the "monkey" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols.*** 

The relevance of the theorem is questionablethe probability of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero). 

***It should also be noted that real monkeys don't produce uniformly random output***, which means that ***an actual monkey hitting keys for an infinite amount of time has no statistical certainty of ever producing any given text.***

So that would be approximately $107.2 million per year for the next five years.

To compare, Reddit costs just over $33.5k per month in server expenses, so that's $402,000 per year, which is less than HealthCare.Gov, but they are very different animals.

<TEXT> Nix Uotan? Final Crisis made him a human vessel through with the Overmonitor can see the unified reality, which has since split again so he's really unknown as far as the New 52 is concerned. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he's been mentioned since Final Crisis. If he were, he'd win; you're absolutely right. He has all the answers to guys like Superman and The Flash.

As for Captain Atom, I'm not convinced he could take Superman or The Flash. Although Captain Atom can create insane amounts of power and even transmute matter, he also absorbs energy, which means Superman or The Flash could overwhelm him until he's unstable, reaches critical, and he self-destructs. 

If he can transmute the entire battle arena or at least a lot of it into Kryptonite, that would be one way he could gain an advantage over Superman, but I don't know what he could do against The Flash. I'd see The Flash whipping up some Speed Force nonsense, Captain Atom overloads and explodes, The Flash contains it, and we have a winner.

I'd also question Captain Atom's abilities against Shazam. He doesn't really have any defense against magic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question. 

That's the total cost for the entire project, which includes setting up the physical and technical infrastructure for the entire exchange, as well as every state's exchange (those that chose to implement them, anyway). It also includes staffing for all the people who did that work, as well as all the lawyers/business people/bureaucrats who made the whole project work.

It wasn't so much a $634m website; it was a $634m system.

/u/EngineeredMadness talks about a lot of the bureaucratic and technical backend reasons that make this project expensive by it's very nature: http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwhsmv

/u/avacar points out that the $634m price tag is a grand total over several contracts that were signed to the company that did the work. There was a whole lot of prep work that took years to go through in order to even be able to begin building a system this complex, and it took a lot of people a lot of time to do it. Couple this with EngineeredMadness's points and you've got a pretty good idea of what happened.

http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwgh1k

Again, I'm not defending the site, or the cost. It's a government contract, it almost undoubtedly had more bloat to it than it needed to. But if you really look at all the in's and out's of what it would take to build a system this complex, you can at least comprehend the reasoning behind why the numbers got so large, and can hopefully appreciate why keeping the site both functional, responsive, and stable is a momentous undertaking.

Actual costs of overhead are much, much higher, as in $[279 ***billion***. ](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/27/obamacares-big-overhead-costs-to-top-270b.html)

[There are approximately 321.3 million American citizens](http://www.census.gov/popclock/), so you could instead give $644.25 to each citizen.

I think most people would probably rather have the insurance than the $644.25, but that's purely speculation on part. I can't prove that.

**EDIT**: Looks like the actual costs of the website were significantly higher: Office of Inspector General released a report finding that the total cost of the HealthCare.gov website had reached $1.7 billion.

I really think they should consider allowing it to be canon, make a sequel, and even if they can't get Ryan or they think he'd be too strongly associated with the competitor's Deadpool, they could introduce John Stewart, Kyle, or even Guy and have all this compatible with Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, Justice League, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The Homer" (also known as "The Car Built for Homer") was a car designed by Homer Simpson when his half-brother, Herb, gave Homer a job at Powell Motors. It is a parody/exaggeration of the Edsel, a similarly disastrous automobile designed by Ford Motor Company.

http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer

The storyline of a controversially styled car causing the company to fail both echoes that of the Edsel and the Tucker Torpedo. The Edsel was a controversially styled car that bore the name of Henry Ford's son, Edsel Ford, and is now considered one of the biggest car flops in history. Production of the Tucker Torpedo, which introduced many new features, was shut down amidst scandal and accusations of stock fraud in 1949.[3] Homer wants the horns of the car he is designing to play the traditional Spanish folk corrido "La Cucaracha".[5] The Pope shows up for the unveiling of Homer's new car.[5] Herb berates his staff for suggesting that the company name a new car "Persephone" after the Greek goddess of fertility in Greek mythology. Herb tells the staff, "People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads! They want names like 'Mustang' and 'Cheetah'vicious animal names," referencing the Ford Mustang and Lamborghini Cheetah cars.[6]

<TEXT> It's unfairly maligned. Khan was supposed to end the series, so it made some moves that couldn't be sensibly undone. It turned out to be so damned good, it revitalized interest in the franchise. Of course they needed Spock, he played hard ball and said he'd only come back if he could direct, and they did what they thought they had to.

The trailers also gave away one of the biggest surprises: the death of the USS Enterprise.

<TEXT> The Joker was already iconic before the animated series with Hamill though

No shit, that's why I said: "Hamill's voice and laugh as The Joker is an iconic voice and laugh associated with an iconic villain." I didn't say his voice and laugh made the character iconic. 


And the nonstop circlejerk for Hamill's Joker ought to prove that Hamill absolutely deserves credit for his takes on the character which are clearly preferred and beloved by either a majority of the fans or an insanely vocal minority. 

I personally have never once picked up a comic book and heard Jack Nicholson or Ledger's voice or laugh in my head. Hamill's? That's all I'll ever hear because you just can't top perfection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spoiler alert (I can never get the spoiler tags to work; I have not ruled out the possibility that I'm an idiot).

Storyline: Darkseid War is going on and whenever Darkseid is at war, the New Gods are involved. This includes Metron who was dethroned from The Mobius Chair, which Batman takes the liberty of sitting on, which only a god can/should do, and it gives him godlike omniscience; the chair can answer any question. Basically, Batman can know anything that is knowable, so he asks it who killed his parents, the true identity of The Joker, and the answer to why it is that 42 is the answer to everything.

In reality? Only Geoff Johns could answer that, but it wouldn't be the first time they took real-world criticisms and turned them on their heads for the purpose of storytelling. The "Batgod" label has been pervasive in DC Comics for some time, often making Batman seem bizarrely OP for a guy with no superpowers. I would imagine a pitch meeting where someone said, "What if he were actually made a god? What would he do?" and the responses to that question were interesting enough to warrant exploring.

That and having him straight up murder Darkseid has already been done, so they were probably trying to figure out a new way to wrap this thing up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Terry's Batman isn't Elseworlds; it's considered canon. 

As for precedent, In Jeph Loeb's Superman/Batman #22 (preNew52 version written by Jeph Loeb), a Batman wearing the Beyond costume appeared, which was the Beyond version of Batman's first foray into the regular DC Comics continuity. Bizarro was transported to an alternate version of Gotham City. In issue #23, this Batman is named "Tim". 

Fun fact: the packaging for the action figure created by DC Direct based on this appearance in Superman/Batman identifies Batman Beyond as Tim Drake.

As for mainstream continuity, in Batman #700, Terry McGinnis was included in the one-off as a part of the DC Universe presented, had a history with Damian Wayne, who rescued him as Batman from Two-Face-Two when he was held hostage as an infant. Terry was directly inspired by Batman, but it was the Damian Wayne Batman. 

The plot involved Two-Face-Two (if ever a villain warranted a sequel) believed Terry McGinnis was one of a pair of twin boys who were the sons of billionaires rather than Warren and Mary McGinnis. Two-Face-Two transformed Terry into a miniature duplicate of the Joker with the Joker's toxin. Damian administered the antidote after he rescued Terry. In the following page, a teenage McGinnis is seen behind the Batman cowl, battling the apparently-resurrected Joker, with Damian as his mentor, instead of Bruce.

Superman/Batman Annual #4 featured Terry McGinnis' Batman in mainstream continuity as well. It picked up after Superman's first meeting with the new Terry Batman, and Terry Batman also took part heavily in Future's End. 

He is 100% a part of regular DC continuity.

Or *was.*

But it's comics, so he'll totally come back because clones or time travel or alternative dimensions or whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The default, regular Robin on the show is Dick, the female is CK, but the other two are very debatable. 

Dick   Jason are the only two to ever wear the fish scale armor short shorts, and since regular Robin is Dick, that would leave short shorts to be Jason, but the personality is more in line with silver age Robin, AKA Dick. 

Meanwhile, the black-caped Robin is wearing Tim Drake's threads and has the darker attitude, but that attitude could be associated with Tim or Jason.

So... my take is that it's representations of different takes on Robin without being any identity in particular. Robin has been the wide-eyed Boy Wonder of the silver age, the Dark Knight Returns Girl Wonder, and the darker, more brooding sidekick. </TEXT>

Still, I thought Begins was overall a strong entry and set the stage quite nicely for The Dark Knight. I do feel like The Dark Knight was a bit rushed or overstuffed though. There was enough there to make The Joker the one-and-only and have Dent's transformation a background story, revealing the Two-Face part in the following movie. They basically introduced one of Batman's greatest and most interesting villains just to kill him ten minutes later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no "best." The character has been the subject of so many different takes, and there have been very few I didn't like. One such example was the Young Justice version, which is one of the few things that show got heinously wrong.

Dennis O'Neil's take on the character in the 70s is what a lot of people would consider the "classic" Joker and the one that has inspired most interpretations. He did a really great job fleshing out the character and even scored him his own book, which was unheard of for villains. 

Steve Englehart introduced the classic "Laughing Fish" that was used in Batman: The Animated Series. Marshall Rogers introduced the trench coat and fedora which impacted Jack Nicholson's Joker. 

Speaking of which, if you need a legendary actor to play a crazy man, who better than Jack? Tim Burton brought the "goth" to Gotham giving us a demented, insane, criminal mastermind with a twisted sense of humor. While Burton's Batman missed a lot of important points regarding the Batman of comic books, Nicholson's Joker, at the time, was incredibly close to the comics, including the acid bath origin, the disfigured face, not wearing makeup, etc.

Cesar Romano's 1966 TV series Joker was a product of a campy show, more like the zanny nuisance trickster, but that's where get the mainstays like joy buzzers and acid-spitting flowers from.

Mark Hamill's Joker, whether DCAU or the Arkham series of games, gave most us of us the voice we hear in our heads whenever we read the character's lines. The voice and ironic laugh are just unbeatable, and the cartoon very cleverly kept a psychotic clown character in a show geared for children by hinting at the horror without often painting the picture. He was a nice balance of silly and psycho.

Frank Miller's Joker in Dark Knight Returns or Alan Moore's in The Killing Joke each defined the character in their own way. They're two of the darker interpretations, but they're undeniable classics. DKR undoubtedly influenced A Death in The Family, one of the most infamous stories in comics with lasting repercussions. 

Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth was groundbreaking and a terrifying look at the character.

The New 52 face-as-a-mask version of Death of the Family was over-the-top, but perhaps the most horrifying. 

As for Heath Ledger, his Joker was intelligent, meaningful, and, in spite of all his cunning calculation and strategic planning, an ironic agent of chaos. It's one of the most memorable and iconic performances in film. 

The Joker is quite possibly the best villain in all of fiction and certainly the best in comics. With so many different takes on the character, I don't see a "best." I see different ways of looking at the same thing, and that thing is the scary nature of the universe and especially death being sadly chaotic and what it means to confront that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Technically 'pink' is just light red

It's got a bit more range than that in terms of what most people would call "pink." In optics, pink can refer to any of the colors between bluish red (purple/violet) and red, of medium to high brightness and of low to moderate saturation.

Although pink is *generally* considered a tint of red--so you're not wrong--most variations of pink lie between red, white and magenta colors. This means that the pink's hue is usually between red and magenta, not just red. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This Slate article appears to back OP.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/11/07/revolving_doors_why_don_t_we_use_them_more.html)

The story goes like this: Theophilus Van Kannel hated chivalry. There was nothing he despised more than trying to walk in or out of a building, and locking horns with other men in a game of oh you first, I insist. But most of all, Theophilus Van Kannel hated opening doors for women.

He set about inventing his way out of social phobia. And thats how, in 1888, Theophilus Van Kannel was awarded US Patent #387571 A for a storm-door structure, which would soon become known as the revolving door. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the gentleman's deleted comment said that being a parent of a child with autism isn't any more effort than a child without, which is an asinine comment. 

However, speaking strictly to your question, as horrible as this sounds, I did work with some kids who would have been better off dead, and please don't judge me too harshly until you've had the same experiences. The quality of life for some incredibly low-functioning autistic kids, as well as the severely mentally or physically disabled would be like a lifelong nightmare for some. 

If you were confined to a wheelchair, had little motor control, needed someone to spoon feed you food that has been put through a blender with thickening agent, you had to be fed tiny amounts over a long period of time to limit the likelihood of choking, and you were constantly shitting yourself and incapable of communication, would *you* want to live? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it's not any more than a kid without autism

As someone who worked in a school for children with Autism, many of whom lived on campus because their parents literally could not handle them, I cannot stress strongly enough how incredibly wrong you are.

Most parents don't have to live in fear of being viciously attacked, the acts of self harm, having constant supervision to make sure they don't eat something they're not supposed to, having to physically restrain your child so they don't hurt themselves or others, bolting, or a myriad of other autistic behaviors like low functioning "children" who are near adult age and can't wipe after using the toilet, *if* they make it in the first place.

[Here's one tiny example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_23z9yJAq0) These parents likely go through this and things like this multiple times a day.

Educate yourself before spewing such wanton ignorance. Such nonsense is a slap in the face to every parent who has had to endure raising a severely autistic child. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I would never call "That was Then. This is Now" a sequel of "The Outsiders."

*You* wouldn't, and that's fine, but it kind of is. It's got the same setting and even shares a few characters as I recall Ponyboy being directly involved.

You raise an interesting point, though. The concept of a "shared universe." S. E. Hinton does this as does Bret Easton Ellis, and there's got to be a better word for something than "spin-off" or "prequel/sidequel/sequel" for stories that take place in the same universe and may even feature some of the characters but aren't directly related to the other stories. 

For example, both Marvel and DC Comics have numerous shared universes, but this month's issue of Batman isn't necessarily a sequel to this month's issue of Superman even if Batman's issue comes out after Superman's and even takes place chronologically directly after. If one's story doesn't impact the other's, it's not really a sequel, is it? </TEXT>

John Cleese subtly killing it on Letterman 1988

John Cleese is the subject. "Killing" is the predicate. "It" is the object. "Subtly" is an adverb, i.e., a word describing an action. The only action indicated by the title is "killing (it)," in this context a phrase meaning "entertaining an audience." Therefore, "subtly" is describing the way he is entertaining, which is humour, therefore /u/aperfectly_cromulent is both correct and perfectly cromulent. </TEXT>

It's both.

[Better Call Saul is an American television drama series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a prequel/spin-off of Breaking Bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul)

The terms are not mutually-exclusive. If it concerns characters and a "world" from the same series, a spin-off happening before the events of its parent show is a prequel; if the events are after the parent series, it is a sequel. If the shows have an overlapping timeline, then it's a parallel spinoff called a [sidequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_%28media%29) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The photographer/artist wrote the following to go along with the image on Facebook:

Mainers are unflappable. If it snows over two and a half feet, they grab a shovel in the morning so they can continue moving ahead. On Monday night, an estimated 10,000 of them were on hand to gush at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland, filling every seat and the floor in front of Bernie Sanders who was there to tell his incredibly important story as he turns the struggle of an underdog into an onrushing train, possibly heading for an American presidency. Here is only one of my photos of a crowd, filled with old codgers and young voters. Moore, later!

<TEXT> Coincidentally, I recently read Hemingway's *The Sun Also Rises* which chronicles a trip to the Festival of San Fermn in Pamplona to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights. I never knew much about bullfights, only that I was against it because of the killing of the bull and using animals for entertainment in general. What I learned was deplorable. Granted, the book takes place at the dawning of the twentieth century, but I was truly appalled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aside from the way technology can warp a voice, there was a particular standard of pronunciation and stuff called the [Transatlantic Accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_accent) that was used widely for broadcast and theatre purposes for a long time. It was learned (meaning it didn't belong to a specific area and no one spoke it as their native type of English) and it incorporated aspects of standard American and standard British accents. We still have certain standards for radio voices now but it's more about projecting your voice and speaking clearly, rather than with a certain accent.

The metaphor is that Superman is a god and Batman doesn't believe in him, not that he doesn't exist, but that Batman doesn't believe him to be a god. It's not that Superman believes himself a god either; just that he's thought of as one for obvious reasons. Note the trailer with the statue and the cult of believers. </TEXT>

I couldn't begin to list everyone who has ever written the character, then there's the movies, television, animation, video games, etc. He exists in literally hundreds of continuities, canons, etc. The writer dictates their interpretation, and Batman has been portrayed as Christian, but he also been portrayed a non-believer.

Note the word ***INDIAN***. I can do this all day.

And how many native peoples have you actually met and talked to? I'm curious myself as an Indian, Moche tribe.

I'll repeat, as of 1995, according to the [US Census Bureau, 50% of people who identified as indigenous preferred the term American Indian, 37% preferred Native American, and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf) You may well have met all 37% of the total number of native peoples who prefer "Native American," and that's dandy, but it does not argue my point that the term "Indian" is not offensive to most Indians.

<TEXT> I expect we'll get it, and to be fair, the first actual DC Cinematic Universe movie was Man of Steel and is so far the *only* DC Cinematic Universe movie. Everything prior was its own separate canon. 

That being said, I don't consider Man of Steel dark or brooding; it was simply as realistic and grounded as a Superman movie could possibly be. It was also made specifically as the set-up for Batman V Superman, which itself is the set-up for Justice League, so I consider it groundwork-laying more than a great narrative in and of itself. In other words, I don't think Man of Steel can be judged fairly until we better understand how it fits with the larger narrative.

If anything could be taken away from that film as the WB approach to comic book movies, it's doing them in such a way as to ask, "What if this was actually happened in real life?" whereas Marvel tends to more openly embrace the most comic book-y elements apologetically. 

Naturally, some people prefer one method more than the other. I personally like both for different reasons, but I do solidly believe that Spider-Man 3 and Amazing Spider-Man 2 both managed to kill their respective franchises for the same reason; they were too over-the-top stupid for their own good.

You can definitely go too far in either direction.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, the Thai subtitles on the video are consistent with Gale's music choices which are demonstrative of his idiosyncratic and peculiar personality. He is a fan of foreign language music and apparently speaks fluent Italian. As an example, as he waters his plants in his apartment, he sings along with Quartetto Cetra's "Crapa Pelada." A jazzy song, the Italian lyrics of Crapa Pelada are a bit of a tongue-twister because of its incredibly fast tempo. 

So I find it perfectly believable that on a trip to Thailand, Gale created a film version of himself performing a camp karaoke version of Peter Schilling's "Major Tom (Coming Home)." He also had a picture of himself on Mt. Everest which is less than 3,000 miles away. 

Other possessions in his apartment included vintage cameras, a mask, a potato battery, a water pipe, a copy of Stephen King's *Everything's Eventual*, Jane Austen in *BOCA*, The Waverley Novels, *The Magnificent Activist: The Writing of Thomas Wentworth Higginson*, and *Fundamentals of Marxism Leninism*, which is odd for a Libertarian. His apartment also contains a pair of skis and a surfboard. He enjoyed drinking both coffee and tea. In Gales Lab Notes, along with the Heisenberg formula, he included a list of top ten recumbent bikes, a recipe for vegan s'mores, indoor composting tips, and a Far Side cartoon where the scientist is about to pop a paper bag behind the one working on the nuclear warhead.

<TEXT> Fun facts (for anyone wondering):

The T. Rex comes from an adventure on "Dinosaur Island" (Batman #35, 1946); the penny was originally a trophy from Batman's encounter with a penny-obsessed villain named the Penny Plunderer (World's Finest Comics #30, 1947). Other "keepsakes" in the cave come from "The Thousand and One Trophies of Batman!" (Detective Comics #158, 1950). These three stories were reprinted in Batman #256.

Other pieces often shown in the Batcave include Two-Face's original coin, one of Deathstroke's swords, the shroud of the vampiric Monk, and over-sized ten-pins.

He has also had Fries' original freeze gun, a piece of Kryptonite, and old partner costumes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you like brightly-colored, jokey, fast-paced, explosion-filed punch-festivals with thin plots and nothing to have to think too hard about, Marvel movies exist. They're great, entertaining popcorn superhero flicks.

There's no point in having two different brands if they're just going to make the same movies.

I like the darker, more serious, more thoughtful tone of DC's movies. I'd rather watch The Dark Knight 100x than see Age of Ultron a second. 

My favorite ice cream is cookies   cream, but I'm sure glad there's a variety at the store so other people can get what *they* like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Their mascot is offensive, and you could argue that naming a team after a ethnic group at all is in poor taste, but "redskins" is a racial slur whereas "Indians," though an obvious misnomer, is still popularly used by Native Americans and non-Native Americans alike.

In fact, as of 1995, according to the [US Census Bureau, 50% of people who identified as indigenous preferred the term American Indian, 37% preferred Native American, and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf) It may have changed in the past 20 years, but I can't recall ever once hearing American Indians refer to themselves as "Native American." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminds me of what Dylan said about Hendrix' version of "All Along The Watchtower."

Dylan has described his reaction to hearing Hendrix's version: "It overwhelmed me, really. He had such talent, he could find things inside a song and vigorously develop them. He found things that other people wouldn't think of finding in there. He probably improved upon it by the spaces he was using. I took license with the song from his version, actually, and continue to do it to this day." 

In the booklet accompanying his Biograph album, Dylan said: "I liked Jimi Hendrix's record of this and ever since he died I've been doing it that way... Strange how when I sing it, I always feel it's a tribute to him in some kind of way." </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The first time [Nintendo's lead game designer Shigeru Miyamoto] played with the controller, because hes working most of the time on Mario 64, he would have seen Mario 64 with it. It wasnt so much that controller dictated Mario 64, it was just that was the game he was working on. Mario was the way of testing it out. Probably more the other way around. The actual movement of Mario came from the N64 controller, the way you move the central stick."

 Giles Goddard, Super Mario 64 programmer

[Source](http://pixelatron.com/blog/the-making-of-super-mario-64-full-giles-goddard-interview-ngc)

"I think thats a misnomer to say that the N64 controller was designed around Super Mario 64. Yes, Mr. Miyamoto wanted analog control because he had a vision of how he wanted that game to work, but the controller wasnt designed specifically for one game."

'I would like to apologize to Mark's family and friends for what I did to them. I would like to apologize to my family,' Towery said.

'So many times in my life I went left when I should have gone right and I went right when I should have gone left. It was mistake after mistake.'

<TEXT>  His change throughout the first book is for the better. He's grown above what society made him and become what society could be.

The only part I would argue is that I believe he was *always* better. From the outset he knows he's being manipulated and hates it. From the very first violent encounter, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and of course, the people watching his every move *could* intervene, but they don't, and this recurs three more times.

When he's at the lake and Valentine visits, he's done. He's had it with everyone's shit and she has to talk him into saving a world he's not convinced is worth saving. He sees the military that's been manipulating him as his real enemy and refers to them as such. He always doubted that he was on the right side and never felt in control. Valentine later confirms this on Eros telling him that no one is really in control of their own destiny and that she has manipulated him and was manipulated herself.

The end of the book proves what he suspected all along and also proves that he has always wanted to do the right thing and will search the galaxy to do so. The bugger queen obviously knew he was pure of heart or she wouldn't have created the elaborate set-up for her infant queen based on what she saw in Ender's mind.

I see the story as being about an inherently good person who is too powerful a tool not to be misused. He's like some well-intentioned nuclear warhead that doesn't mean anyone any harm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have felt that way, but I thought they did a good job of trying to justify everything by the end of it, revealing motivations, weighing what "doing the right thing" actually meant, 

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***

finding out that the buggers not only weren't evil, but they were never even going to mount a third invasion because they realized they were fighting sentient life and would extend forgiveness and hope to be forgiven; they had no way of knowing.

Earlier parts of the book hinted that they might have just been wanting for a means of communication. Ender I think was likeable and did have a sense of morality in that he tried to understand and love them--he even used those words--and was used as a tool against them. He didn't even know he was killing them when he did. Hell, he never knew he was killing anybody at the time when he did. He felt bad about things. He was a good kid with a ton of talent who was used. So was Valentine. Disagree with Graff all day, but he thought he either was doing the right thing or else at least believed he was doing whatever was necessary. 

As to why anyone was worth saving, Valentine speaks to that best of all when she's telling Ender that it's all these individual lives and relationships throughout the earth that they don't even know. The reader knows, because we're them. We're just regular people trying to live our little lives while psychopaths vie for power and risk the lives of everyone on earth over money, land, power, etc. On that note, I found it very relatable. Change the existential threats, rework the politics a skosh, and scale down the technology a little and you've got a fairly apt parable of what goes on in the real world today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 5/5: All I asked was that it live up the hype. It did. For those of you who haven't read it, the less you know about it, the better.

Apparently there are fifteen sequels, which kind of blows my mind. Reading them would put off reading much else for a while, so if anyone can speak to the quality of the sequels, please do inform.

I'm now kind of curious to see the movie, but after looking at IMDb and RT ratings, I'm not sure I want this experienced ruined by a shitty adaptation. Any thoughts from those who have read the book AND seen the movie?

**EDIT**: Thank you for all the helpful responses!

<TEXT> Here's the thing, though, as my psychologist wife would likely point out: the diagnosis is only part of the story.

Do I feel like I should be allowed to have a gun? Yes. I'm an intelligent, responsible, law-abiding citizen who respects his country, his fellow countrymen, and all reasonable laws. Anyone who knows me well would vouch for me and undoubtedly sign off on it saying, "Yes, I know this man; he can be trusted with a firearm."

Get ready for the twist: as a general rule, I would not want most people with borderline personality disorder to have a gun.

In fact, I feel that way strongly enough that I would give up my own right to a gun just to keep everyone else with borderline personality disorder from having one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Plenty of them? Really?

Let's list white comic book superheroes then black superheroes and then note the insane difference. Then let's compare sales and notoriety.

Black superheroes: Black Panther, Storm, Spawn, Black Lightning, Green Lantern (John Stewart), Static, Mr. Terrific, Cyborg, Steel, Blade, Vixen, Icon   Rocket, Hardware, Bronze Tiger, Black Spider, Luke Cage, War Machine, Falcon, Bishop, Night Thrasher, Cloak, and a few others mainstream movie goers have never heard of.

White Superheroes: Almost every other superhero is white.

So Black Panther has a movie pending, Storm is only featured alongside the X-Men, Spawn had a movie, the only Green Lantern you can expect to see is Hal, Static had a cartoon but don't hold your breath for a movie, Mr. Terrific is relatively unknown and won't get a movie, people are already bitching about Cyborg's inclusion in the Justice League movie, Steel had a shitty movie and is just a Superman knockoff anyway, Blade had the trilogy that kicked off the comic book movie boom, Vixen is getting an animated series, Icon   Rocket are relative unknowns and won't get a movie but were featured in Young Justice, Hardware is unknown and won't get a movie, Bronze Tiger   Black Spider are borderline heroes but Bronze Tiger is in the CW Version of the Suicide Squad and both might be featured in a Suicide Squad movie sequel if the first one is successful, Luke Cage might appear in a Marvel TV series, War Machine has had multiple movie appearances but it's just the Iron Man knockoff, Falcon has appeared in a limited sidekick role, Bishop was briefly in an X-Men movie, Night Thrasher and Cloak may make appearances in a Marvel TV series. </TEXT>

Context matters, and to all the people upvoting /u/CuntSmellersLLP (ah, Reddit), you might bother to look up the definition of the word "bigotry."

bigotry

bitr/

noun

noun: bigotry; plural noun: bigotries

***intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself.***


So yeah, dismissing a person merely because they hold or lack a certain belief differently than you is, by virtue of definition, ***bigotry.***

If a man or a woman would make a great president but he or she legitimately believed in the Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus, his or her actions ought to be judged by what he or she actually *does*, not but his or her absurd beliefs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> there's a difference between having sexuality and appearing sexualized

Yes, there is; almost everyone on earth *has* sexuality, the only exception being people who claim to be asexual. We're talking about her having been sexualized from her earliest appearances in media which was in Batman: The Animated Series from which I have provided multiple examples, i.e., evidence. You're arguing against something I've already proved. 

Catwoman has always been portrayed as dripping sexuality, it's part of her personality. But Harley never was, that's just not true. 

Again, I've repeatedly shown that she has. The only difference is how much they were able to get away with on a prime time cartoon whose audience was mainly children. In the same way that they portrayed Catwoman and Poison Ivy on Batman: The Animated Series, they had to be suggestive and imply rather than being as overt as they can be in comics. 

You honestly can't see the difference between the page you linked from 1998, and the one in the OP?

There's nothing even implied by the Deviant Artists' work. There's nothing overtly sexual about it. Her outfit is a slightly more revealing version of her original costume. All it shows is her navel, some breast cleavage, and upper thighs. She's not posed provocatively, and she has a lipstick kiss on a Joker doll due to her well-established connection to the character. There's nothing overly sexual about it. Sexy, yes, but not sexual.

The picture I linked has a horny Harley wearing lingerie, mounting a desk, begging for sex by asking Mistah J to take a ride on *his* Harley while revving herself up.

So yeah, I *can* see the difference; OP's pic is tasteful and classy whereas the cartoon I linked was brazenly filthy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You still don't get it and this is the last I'll try and explain because at this point I'm just tired.

I come across a bunch of people complaining a specific McDonald's restaurant sells a low quality product low in nutritional value but high in sugars, fats, calories etc. I point out that not only is this specific McDonald's restaurant not unique, but that McDonald's restaurants in general are only part of a larger problem, i.e., fast food, junk food, how it's marketed, etc., etc., concurring that McDonald's definitely has problems, but so do all these other similar things.

Get it?

You don't have to keep telling me what the conversation is about. My point is that there's a larger issue, just like if there was a conversation about a specific line or paragraph or page in the Qur'an that is problematic, I'd mention that there are many more like it.  </TEXT>

The point is that /u/kgt5003's comment that "a Muslim taking The Quran taken literally and living that way wouldn't be pretty" isn't unique to The Quran, indeed living literally by The Bible and/or The Torah would also mean horrifying things.

And what on earth is your point on making anything more valid? *What* is making *what* more valid? Did you actually think my comment intended to validate living literally by The Quran because doing so would be as good as living literally by The Bible?

Why am I even having to explain my comment to you? It wasn't complicated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bing Bong made the greatest sacrifice possible.

I was reading the official discussion thread over at /r/movies and some people were pointing out that Bing Bong was never mentioned again and some were expecting his memory to be brought up somewhere toward the end or even in a post-credits scene. 

I'm so glad they didn't.

Because as soon as you do that, there is no sacrifice. He's a figment of her imagination; he was never alive nor did he ever die. He was rattling around in her brain aimlessly and without purpose. It was in his sacrifice that he was able to make a real difference for the first time in a long time, and only greater sacrifice than giving your life for someone else's is to do so anonymously and not even be remembered for it. There was absolutely nothing in it for him at all. No fame, no glory, no memory. 

When he started helping Joy   Sadness, he was doing it because they said they could help her remember him. He was doing it for selfish reasons. His last act was the most unselfish thing he could ever do, knowingly sacrificing both his existence and any memory of him ever having existed.

Anything more would have cheapened it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your arguments are from the perspective of a viewer of Man of Steel in our universe, not from the perspective of a Metropolis citizen in the Man of Steel universe.

All they know is aliens invaded their planet and threatened their world because Superman was there and they wanted to kill him. Then a fight breaks out and the result is like a dozen 9/11s. It was like living in Tokyo during a Godzilla fight. No one in Tokyo gives a shit if Godzilla was the "good guy" or "bad guy" in the fight; they care that their entire city was razed.

Then you'll have Lex Luthor helping to rebuild and using the distrust and fear, fueling it, adding speculation like, "What if Superman decided to take over the world? What if he decided to destroy it?"

People fear what they don't understand; Superman is beyond understanding; fear leads directly to hate. Yes, some people are going to see through all that and not blame him for the Kyptonian invasion and get that he didn't intentionally destroy half the city and was just trying to stop really horrible aliens from doing really horrible shit, and that's why there will be more than one position.

It's kind of political thriller when you think about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're absolutely right, and you're citing one of my favorite writers alongside one of my favorite Superman stories to make your point.

The thing with Man of Steel though is that it was the first installment in the DC Cinematic Universe and they had the future to think about. Barring a complete and total commercial flop, Man of Steel would be the foundation for each DCCU film to follow, and that includes setting a tone. Part of it was to set itself apart from Marvel, and the success of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy was a clear message to the brass at Warner Bros. that the audiences liked their DC Comics movies darker, more serious, and with a more grounded approach, so they weren't about to fix something that wasn't broken. They could have gone lighter with Man of Steel, but then it probably would have done a shit job of setting up Batman V Superman, and more importantly, Justice League and its spin-offs. 

Unless Superman is fallible, thoughtful, philosophical, and grounded, he won't fit in when Batman shows up as his antithesis and they won't get to play with all the fun ideas of different philosophical approaches to seeking justice that the comics have played with over the decades. The trailer basically screams "Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns The Movie," and they obviously want to explore some of those ideas. 

For people who really didn't like Man of Steel, hey, opinions are opinions, tastes are tastes, but I caution patience. They're going somewhere with this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You argued my own point against yourself. Yes, every superhero has to resist the urge to act selfishly and deal with the consequences of power, but not like Superman because he's not a bright teenager bitten by a radioactive spider who can do whatever it is a spider does (like ESP, apparently). He's a god. He's is practically invincible, powerful beyond reason, and has a variety of powers at his disposal that are usually meted out one or two at a time for other heroes. Any normal person would justifiably have a god complex. 

If I were Superman--I won't even lie or sugarcoat it on the internet anonymously for strangers to read it--I would take over the world and shape it as I see fit. I'd be a benevolent overlord, but an overlord I would be, and the shitty thing is, I'm not some megalomaniac asshole; I'm a regular guy. I'd do what most people would do. 

Superman is interesting because he doesn't. He's above that. Injustice's who premise is pretty much, "What if something happened that made Superman do what any of us would do and impose his will on the world because he can?" </TEXT>

I like that the brands have separate and recognizably different approaches. I know when I see a Marvel movie it'll be a big, colorful, fun, smash-em-up explosion and punch festival with little jokes sprinkled in with paper thin plots. 

I know when I see a DC movie it'll be more grounded, realistic, darker in tone, and have actual meaning and consequences to think about. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it was a rule invented for more kid friendly stuff

It's actually more to do with having recurring villains. For example, Batman has been published for over 75 years and across dozens of different monthly titles, limited series, one-shots, graphic novels, etc. If Batman killed his villains, the writers would have to keep coming up new ones all the time and we wouldn't have all these classic recurring characters.

What people fail to understand is that movies don't have this problem. The Joker is probably only going to appear once per franchise, so killing him doesn't matter. 

As for Man of Steel, the kill meant something. It seemed to be the only thing he could do at the time, and he'll face the consequences for it. It's going to be pivotal moment for him and he'll have decisions to make. Guys like Lex will get to make multiple appearances throughout the DC Cinematic Universe because Superman is going to have to think up better ways of handling his adversaries than execution or no one will trust him and he's too powerful a being to be both untrusted *and* left alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with everything you wrote. "Man of Steel" was laying the groundwork for a franchise and had to establish a new Superman that was never the Christopher Reeves version nor ~~The Atom~~ Brandon Routh version nor the Lois   Clark version or the DCAU version. 

You hit the nail right on the head. This was Clark Kent becoming the Man of Steel. That ending that everyone complains about is him dealing with the consequence of his godlike power, the fallout from it, exploring the psychology of an outsider who wants to do good but isn't trusted because he's just too damned powerful. It's the most realistic take on Superman ever committed to film, so yeah, he's not going to be the bright eyed blue boy scout holding an American flag in one hand and an bald eagle perched on the other while telling kids to take their vitamins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done exactly that and can't hear any difference. This exact type of blind study has been done many times from many sources with similar result each time: most people can't tell the difference, many people who *can* tell the difference have about an equal chance of favoring either 128 or 320, or there's no preference.

The number of people who can hear the difference and consistently prefer the 320 to the point where they find the difference noteworthy and important, the so-called "audiophiles," are statistically low.

That being said, if you're an audiophile, obviously it's important to you, and it's good we have options like FLAC and sophisticated audio equipment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how it wasn't the "city of tomorrow," but if it wasn't, they totally wrecked it and maybe that's what Lex's rebuilding of Metropolis is all about.

As for him being "The Man of Yesterday," this is the only instance of him ever being called that, and part of the point of Man of Steel was to bring Superman into modern times so he doesn't seem like a dated, corny relic with Ma and Pa, apple pies cooling on window sills, truth, justice, and the American way. It's intentionally modern and as grounded in reality as something as outrageous as Superman can be.

If you didn't like that, you've got plenty of company, but the style in which the movie was done was highly intentional/purposeful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Max Martin signature.

Listen to the bridge of the song, or failing that, listen to the next-to-last chorus or breakdown. You'll notice he has the artist repeat the chorus lyrically with a slightly different melody immediately afterward. Some examples include:

Backstreet Boys - [Shape Of My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT5msu-dap8#t=157)

Backstreet Boys - [I Want It That Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fndeDfaWCg#t=152)

Britney Spears - [Lucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vvBAONkYwI#t=181)

Britney Spears - [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJWtLf4-WWs#t=160)

Britney Spears - [You Drive Me Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4VK9_CfOLQ#t=141)

Britney Spears - [Oops! I Did It Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow#t=188)

Nsync - [It's Gonna Be Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQMlWwIXg3M#t=136)

Nsync - [Tearin' Up My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZcmuKsyvzg#t=159)

He tried desperately to shake the habit in the late 2000s when his career had been slumping for a few years, so you'll be hard pressed to find it now, but back in the 1990s, it was a staple. Why was it so readily employed?

Bo Burnham - [Repeat Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt9c0UeYhFc)

Max's little trick enables the artist to repeat the chorus **yet again** while keeping the song fresh in the listener's mind, much akin to the way a "breakdown" does it by taking away elements of the backing track.

That's not really a great statistic. If this is the strongest self-defense case, it means they're just as likely to be used criminally as they are in self-defense. 

It's also worth noting that those self-defense occurrences are likely to be forced by having to deal with a gun-wielding threat to begin with, i.e., if bad guys didn't have guns, good guys would need guns with which to defend themselves. </TEXT>

As for your 99.99% figure on paper trails, where on earth are you getting that number from? [There is no mandatory gun registration in the United States.](http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/04/gun-ownership-by-the-numbers/) That's why the 270 - 310 million guns figure has a 40 million gun gap. Even under the threat of a felony charge, it is estimated that the compliance rate for gun registration in Connecticut is less than four percent.

Theres no universal gun registry, and thus not a simple way to pin down the exact number of firearms in the U.S. So again, how would you even begin to do a buyback? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the roundabout so well by now when it comes to these issues because this debate rages every single time a mass shooting happens, which is far too often in this country, and while I would like to see something done and I value human life far more than I do gun rights, I have yet to get a satisfactory answer to this one question: what do you do about the guns that are already out there?

[The United States has 88.8 guns per 100 Americans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) That doesn't mean 88.8% of Americans are armed; rather that's how many guns there are in the United States that are owned by somebody. Let's say we went gun control crazy with waiting periods, mental health screenings, background checks, the works. Hell, let's say we banned the sale of any more guns at all making it 100% illegal to sell a firearm. [There are by various estimates anywhere from 270 million to 310 million guns in the United States.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/) What do you do about all those? 

The best suggestion I've heard is a buyback program, but that's voluntary and costly. 

What's the solution? Because until we deal with the reality that the United States has an out-of-control gun fetish, any further restrictions are like saying you can't add any more grains of sand to the beach. </TEXT>

[A Skeptical Science peer-reviewed survey](http://skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-cook-et-al-2013.html) of all (over 12,000) peer-reviewed abstracts on the subject 'global climate change' and 'global warming' published between 1991 and 2011 ([Cook et al. 2013](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article)) found that over 97% of the papers taking a position on the subject agreed with the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.  In a second phase of the project, the scientist authors were emailed and rated over 2,000 of their own papers.  Once again, over 97% of the papers taking a position on the cause of global warming agreed that humans are causing it.

That's the original comment that started this thread. Then I said 

Pretty sure all of them aren't; 31 presidents served only in peace time.


Then /u/icarus-_-sky  said:

Our current president, and every president in the last 50 years has served during peace time. Name one 5-year span that the US has not been involved in a violent conflict in that time period. No declaration of war =! peace time.

To which you replied:

and even when not engaged in direct military conflict[1] (although its tough to find many periods there when America isn't fighting someone, most of which they started themselves), those presidents are still overseeing the CIA as it deliberately undermines Govts, destabilizes nations, and carries out its terrorist attacks around the world[2] .

Even when America isn't publicly at war, its pretty much guaranteed to be killing people somewhere

Staying on topic, you seemed to be justifying the original post which started this thread and that's what I'm responding to. My point isn't "moot;" my point is on topic.

<TEXT> Amazing 1 was alright, so far as I'm concerned, but the biggest strike against it was that it was a reboot of a very recent franchise and tread a lot of familiar ground. I found it more of a dull ride than the original Spider-Man, and the original Spider-Man may not appeal as much to a younger generation who may not be able to appreciate how groundbreaking it was. 

As for ASM2, I can't understand anyone actually enjoying it aside from comedic value as in MST3K mockery of how silly/stupid it was. That being said, opinions vary, but it was the impetus of yet another Spider-Man reboot, so there's that.

You're definitely entitled to your opinion and I'm happy you shared it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Jewish Life in the Middle Ages](http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Life-Middle-Israel-Abrahams/dp/1162729651) is only $9.99 on Kindle and it's quite good if you're interested.

I'll attempt to answer your question, Roth underscored the precarious existence of all peoples' lives in the Middle Ages:

"The modern reader frequently fails to realize that, generally speaking, life in the Middle Ages was not secure. For every section of the population the probabilities of meeting a violent death were high, even in times of comparative peace. Country people were continually subject to the onslaught of bandits or of lawless barons, as well as the marchings and counter marchings of armed forces.

     

[Even] city dwellers ... [ran] the risk of sack and wholesale murder. The whole of medieval, and a great part of modern, history is studded with instance of the sort: the devastation of Attila, the Scourge of God; the ravaging of the Vexin by William the Conqueror; the sack of a score of German cities during the Thirty Years War.

     

There were frequently cases when only a minority of the population survived, the vast majority being piteously massacred.


These events and their like should be borne in mind when one considers the vicissitudes of any particular racial or religious minority. The scarlet of Jewish persecution does not stand out on a ground of virginal white." [ROTH, p. 138]

High school made me think the mark of a great writer was some genius level ability to bury symbolism throughout their writing for people clever enough to dig up.

<TEXT> Your point is taken and well made, but /u/djeijdowq is right so far as Jewish interpretation is concerned. The Talmud interprets the verses referring to "an eye for an eye" and similar expressions as mandating *monetary* compensation in tort cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner. 

Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender, there is no case that could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, foot, etc.

The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (middah k'neged middah) in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society ("and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst") and to deter potential criminals from violating the law ("And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst"). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).

The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow human beings.

<TEXT> No. Despite some vague understanding of how diseases could spread, the existence of viruses and bacteria was unknown in medieval times, and the outbreak of disease could not be scientifically explained. Any sudden deterioration of health was often blamed on poisoning. Europe was hit by several waves of Black Death (often identified as bubonic plague) throughout the late Middle Ages. Crowded cities were especially hard hit by the disease, with death tolls as high as 50% of the population. In their distress, emotionally distraught survivors searched desperately for an explanation. The city-dwelling Jews of the Middle Ages, living in walled-up, segregated ghetto districts, aroused suspicion. An outbreak of plague thus became the trigger for Black Death persecutions, with hundreds of Jews burned at the stake, or rounded up in synagogues and private houses that were then set aflame. With the decline of plague in Europe, these accusations lessened, but the term "well-poisoning" remains a loaded one that continues to crop up even today among anti-Semites around the world.

Walter Laqueur writes in his book The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day:

There were no mass attacks against "Jewish poisoners" after the period of the Black Death, but the accusation became part and parcel of antisemitic dogma and language. It appeared again in early 1953 in the form of the "doctors' plot" in Stalin's last days, when hundreds of Jewish physicians in the Soviet Union were arrested and some of them killed on the charge of having caused the death of prominent Communist leaders... Similar charges were made in the 1980s and 1990s in radical Arab nationalist and Muslim fundamentalist propaganda that accused the Jews of spreading AIDS and other infectious diseases.[3]

<TEXT> My only claim is that the world is not what science says it is

What does science say the world is and how is it wrong?  

there are energies that science cannot quantify in any means in accordance to popular theory

Really? Name them and tell me how science gets it wrong.

I'm not a scientist

***GASP!!!***

I am experienced in martial arts and how the transfer of energy can heal.

Martial arts, literally combat practices, are not about healing; they are about self defense, usually by means of causing harm, injury, incapacitation, or even death to a threatening party. It is not about healing, and certainly nothing to do with magical energies. Whatever dojo you're attending that is preaching this nonsense is ripping you off.

My only point is that just because a scientist can't prove it doesn't mean it's wrong in some cases.

Science isn't about proving things. There's hypothesis, evidence, law, and theory, but no credible scientist goes bandying the word "proof" about. Science leaves "proofs" to mathematics and hard liquor.  

Keep an open mind and realize that the world is simply not what the mainstream so violently declares it to be.

What "mainstream" is "violently" declaring the world to be what? You're just writing words. None of this means anything.

 There are a lot of paths in life including more ion tune with natural energy and those more in tune with defined science, but we are nowhere close enough to declare absolutely that one is right and the other is wrong.

The thing about evidence is that it supports the real; there is no disproving a negative. The "paths" you speak of are more accurately described as those who deal in reality and those who prefer fantasy. As to "right and wrong," if you're not hurting anybody, I could not care less what you believe in.

 I don't understand why my view is so violently opposed other than flat out determination to ignore certain things.

I don't think you understand the definition of the word "violent," and if you chose to believe in magical energies, you are the one ignoring certain things, like a burden of proof. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to scroll this far down to find the most sensible comment on this thread.

Hate to state the obvious here, but we live in a capitalist society in which the film industry and the movie theaters are trying to make money. If the 3D version wasn't more financially rewarding, they wouldn't do it. They're not in business to lose money.

So to all of you bitching about this, vote with your dollars. If you already are, assume that the people who prefer 3D are voting with their dollars too and you're being outvoted. 

Stop trying to force feed us this gimmick format. 

Find me the theater that is forcing anyone to see movies at all, let alone 3D ones. They're making business decisions based on where the money is. If anyone is forcing it, it's the people who like it, who logically are outspending those who don't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the correct answer. The cartoon was the only time any such thing happened.

Wikipedia has a nice write-up of the episode:

The Savage Land appeared in some episodes of the X-Men TV series. It served as the location of Mister Sinister's base. A prominent feature about it was a device designed by Sinister that negated the powers of any mutant in the Savage Land save for Sinister's own forces, rendering the X-Men powerless while fighting him (With the exception of Wolverine's claws as they were a 'bonus' of the Weapon X process, although they would thus cause damage to his hands when used) until the machinery was destroyed. Magneto and Professor X spent much of the show's second season trapped in the Savage Land (Xavier's legs having fortunately been restored as a result of the loss of his powers) until Sinister used them as bait to lure the X-Men into a trap in the season finale, Sinister's forces subsequently being defeated when Wolverine escaped capture and teamed up with Ka-Zar to infiltrate the base and defeat Sinister. In "Savage Land, Savage Heart," the X-Men return to the Savage Land to help Ka-Zar and Shanna fight the threat of Garokk. </TEXT>

Another one I didn't find all that exciting and now I'm really getting why. I appreciate the insight and I think I may be well-served by reading a Hemingway biography before delving into more Hemingway, and I may even give The Sun Also Rises another read after all these posts so adeptly defending its merits. 

Also, thank you for the explanation of the title. It's actually quite apt now that you've put it in context.

This really has become my favorite sub precisely because of threads like this. I would have read it, not liked it because I clearly didn't fully understand it, and I would have unfairly written off a classic by a master. Instead I've been given a wealth of knowledge and means by which to better appreciate it.

You've all been wonderful to take the time. Thank you. </TEXT>

adjective

adjective: satisfied


contented; pleased.

"satisfied customers"

All "somewhat" and "very" do is add a degree of scale to the answer, which is "satisfied" either way, just more or less so. Neither could possibly be read as negative by any sensible person who knows what the word means.

<TEXT> In terms of the actual events that transpired, I found the bullfighting descriptions somewhat interesting albeit appalling, but little else of consequence. Their conversations seemed asinine, although I'll give Hemingway tremendous credit for capturing perfectly the way drunk people actually converse. 

I felt constantly wanting for more drama. When Cohn finally threw a punch, I was ecstatic! It felt like the most exciting thing to happen in the course of the novel. Perhaps there's some disconnect between a man of 2015 and values and ideals of a generation a century past. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a wonderful explanation and I am grateful for it. What perplexed me throughout the novel was what seemed to be a lack of any explicit conflict in need of resolution, but you seem to be saying the conflicts were, in a way, the characters themselves. They all were in pursuit of something and failed at attaining it.

I suppose I didn't connect very well with these characters. I found Brett absolutely awful, Cohn pathetic, Mike an ass, Jake spineless, and Bill... well, I suppose Bill was alright. I didn't understand why Brett was so sought after, why Mike seemed downright amused by Brett's affairs, or at least tolerant of them, or why Jake was so whipped by her that he loved her and yet stood by her as she was drawn to every man like a moth to flame. 

Why *was* Brett so sought after? Was it her title? Was she really that attractive? It seemed every man wanted her and would put up with her. </TEXT>

The Sun Also Rises seemed amysmally dull from the start, and I would not have finished it had the author not been Hemingway. I always felt sure it would get better, and when I read the final sentence, it was like a kick in the teeth. Really? That's it? All that for that?

I don't get the title either. I might have titled it "Drunks Repeating Themselves." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes and no. When they first created their Captain Marvel, they did so in a vacuum. Fawcett couldn't use their Captain Marvel anymore (Billy Batson) because DC sued claiming their Captain Marvel was a knockoff of Superman. Insane as that was, they won. Until Fawcett was bought out by Charlton Comics which was then bought out by DC, Marvel had the one and only Captain Marvel.

Once DC decided to incorporate the old Fawcett/Charlton character into their own lineup, they couldn't release anything with the title "Captain Marvel" because Marvel now owned that publication title, but because the character preexisted and predated Marvel's, they were allowed to keep the character and the name. Hence the series title "Shazam!". 

After skirting this issue for decades with the odd "his name is Captain Marvel; his comic books are Shazam!" scheme, they finally just gave in and officially named him Shazam with the New 52 relaunch. 

As for Marvel's Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel has become one of their top properties over the decades and has a movie coming out, which means Marvel's Captain Marvel will be far better known as *the* Captain Marvel to most audiences. Funny enough, the current release date for her movie coincides with the Warner Bros. film "Shazam!". </TEXT>

You're right about that.

Legend has it that Czarnians can only be killed by other Czarnians, and since he killed all the other Czarnians, there is no real threat to him. Heaven and Hell literally won't take him anyway.

Unfortunately, the bar cop-out made it look like they hid a sex scene off panel and Wolverine found the Rogering so satisfying he required a smoke immediately after... the cigar Lobo was smoking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For context, I have to explain that I am a "white" person and that one of my best friends is "black."

I went over to his apartment one time, and when I walked in the door, he was sitting there eating watermelon. I burst out laughing, and he realized what was up, we both had a good laugh.

Another time we were out and I suggested we get something to eat before we move on to another bar. He suggested KFC, which again, provoked a laugh out of me and then him. He punched me in the arm and said something like, "Don't act like you don't love KFC. I was suggesting it because ***YOU*** like it." Which I do. It's a silly stereotype, because most people I know enjoy fried chicken, regardless of race.

None of this is bad, and none of it is racism. At all. This is basically what people these days would call a "meme," a popular thing to reference that goes way back to some sort of basis in reality. 

Truthfully, I don't know why nor do I especially care about how black people came to be associated with things like watermelon or fried chicken, but we all know of the association, and it's not exactly a cruel or insulting stereotype. 

And what possible agenda could it serve? Who benefits from these stereotypes? Who suffers?

No one. So fuck it. Let's just have fun and be cool to one another. It's not hard. </TEXT>

We need a word that's for non-racists to have fun with stereotypes, like black people can dance/white people can't dance, white nerd culture versus black gangsta culture, etc. all while keeping a friendly, tongue-in-cheek tone about the whole thing.

<TEXT> Based on the history of the shield in canon, I would say no, neither Hulk nor Superman could break it or rip it apart. [It has absolutely withstood a direct blow from Hulk more than once,](http://i.newsarama.com/images/i/000/093/888/original/Capt-America-Shield-Block-Hulk.jpg?1364317923) and, as you can imagine, Hulk attacking Cap means Hulk has completely lost his shit.

As for Superman, the only circumstances in which the shield has been broken has been by literal gods or those endowed with all the power of god, and once by a guy who literally controls all matter at a molecular level. All Superman can do is hit it, and the shield just deflects force. Adding more force is useless.

Basically, consider the shield a force multiplier and the multiplier is zero. Hitting with a force of 1 results in 0. Hitting it with a force of 999,999,999,999 results in 0. Anything times zero is zero.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Doom Patrol/X-Men is more debatable because their timelines were close

That actually seems more like evidence that X-Men *did* rip off Doom Patrol than didn't. X-Men came out three months later, which is enough time to see Doom Patrol and copy it.

Superhuman misfits, led by a paraplegic in a wheelchair, dedicated to protecting a world that shuns them, The Doom Patrol debuted in My Greatest Adventures #80 in June 1963, three months before The X-Men #1 with near-identical cover taglines and the names of their arch-enemies with The Doom Patrols The Worlds Strangest Heroes! versus The X-Mens The Strangest Super-Heroes of All! and The Doom Patrols Brotherhood of Evil versus The X-Mens Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

They're nearly identical. I don't believe in coincidence in general, but certainly not to the degree of a damned near carbon copy just three months after the original. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And isn't Deadpool supposed to be a ripoff of Deadshot?

Deadpool *is* a rip-off of *Deathstroke*, not Deadshot, and no, he's wasn't "supposed to be." Deadpool was initially "created" by Rob Liefeld, a talentless hack who is notorious for ripping off characters and art. Fabian Nicieza was the first to realize it and he's the one who gave Deadpool his real name "Wade Wilson" as an obvious parody of Slade Wilson. In his early outings, he was a lethal assassin with enhanced abilities and healing with a mysterious past. He was Deathstroke in Spider-Man's costume.

Joe Kelly is probably most responsible for the Deadpool we know and love today. What started off as a total rip-off turned into one of the most original and fun characters in comics. </TEXT>

At first it was the usual abstractions, geometric patterns, animations, but as the intensity turned up, I went out on the balcony to smoke and I watched a tree across the street turn into a fire breathing dragon. When I went back inside everything was way too animated and out-of-control. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep it off, which eventually kind of worked. I had never had a bad trip before and wasn't eager to start.

Relax? I couldn't be more relaxed.

Admit that there's more than I think? I'm pretty sure I just did since you were able to think of a few DC rip-offs of Marvel that I didn't.

Stop waving around my big dumb DC-is-better flag? I was never doing that to begin with so I can't very well stop now can I? 

Saying Marvel has ripped-off DC properties numerous times and has done so more than DC has ripped-off Marvel is not the same as saying DC is better, although fantastic arguments as to which brand is better can certainly be made either way. I don't claim one is better; it's a matter of a taste. Personally, I prefer DC.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of these are pretty good, but some are way off.

Swamp Thing   Man Thing debuted within weeks of each other and there's no possible way one creator could have been aware of the other's creation. Call it a cosmic coincidence.

Black Mask is nothing like Red Skull. For one, he wears a mask as opposed to Red Skull being a deformed freak. The first word that comes to mind when I see "Red Skull" is "Nazi." The first word that comes to mind when I see Black Mask is "gangster." Red Skull is basically Hitler whereas Black Mask is basically Al Capone. Red Skull does things as lofty as attempting world domination and even cosmic conquest. Black Mask concerns himself with organized crime in Gotham City.

I get the Blackest Night/Marvel Zombies comparison, but they're really quite different. For one, MZ was an out-of-mainstream continuity story and everyone was zombies. Blackest Night was in-canon, did a lot to further expand the Green Lantern mythos, created a top villain out of a forgotten B-side villain, and the only "zombies" were already deceased DC Comics characters.

The Jason Todd/Red Hood   Buck/Winter Soldier thing is superb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but that's not a comic book company ripping off their only true rival. Also, DC's Batman and Superman both had a number of inspirations, neither was a direct rip-off of anything else. That's patently different than two major companies existing as direct competition to one another and one far more often than the other ripping off its rival and doing so blatantly.

Bumblebee is really the only DC Comics character that I've noticed who was just outrageously obvious a rip-off of a Marvel one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. I've been following both brands for three decades and I can think of way more examples of Marvel ripping off DC than the other way around, as I've shown.

2. Please do.

3. Exactly right. For example, although Deadpool *was* a blatant rip-off of Deathstroke when Rob Liefeld introduced the character, Slade and Wade are nothing alike and the characters have much less in common now than they did then. Plus, things like The Avengers being a rip-off of the Justice League are fairly superficial. Whether DC thought to combine a bunch of their A-list heroes or not, someone would have thought to eventually. </TEXT>

Deathstroke - Deadpool

Green Arrow - Hawkeye

Darkseid - Thanos

The Penguin - The Owl

Suicide Squad/Checkmate/Secret Six - Thunderbolts

Deadshot - Bullseye

Green Lantern Corps - Nova Corp

Doom Patrol - X-Men

Catwoman - Black Cat

Superman - Gladiator/Hyperion/The Sentry

Justice League - Avengers

That being said, DC ripped off Wasp with Bumblebee and Namor with Aquaman. There's probably others, but Marvel is much more thieving of DC than the other way around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Captain America's shield is physically indestructible under normal conditions; while cosmic and godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mjlnir without any visible damage.

It has only been destroyed a few times. 

1. Molecule mean destroyed it, but reassembled it. He has absolute control of all matter, so that's a special exception. 

2. Dr. Doom broke it, but he had the Beyonder's powers at the time, so he was basically a god-like being with limitless power. The Beyonder proper reassembled it like new. 

3. Thanos, already possessing godlike power, was able to shatter it with the Infinity Gauntlet, which is again unlimited power. Nebula fixed it when she used the Gauntlet to undo everything Thanos did.

4. Thor has broken it twice, but required Odinforce the first time and Rune Magic the second time. The first time he fixed it, the second time that particular timeline was undone, so it's like it never happened.

5. Serpent, the Asgardian god of fear and Odin's brother broke it with his bare hands, but he's basically god. It was repaired magically and even stronger now.

So basically, you need omnipotent power and/or magic to destroy it. Due to the enhancements since the last time it was broken, magic is probably useless. Unless you have all the power of god, you can't break it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is, as soon as the animated white-out eyes start moving/expressing motion, they will appear animated, fake, cartoony, and silly. For Deadpool, that will work wonders and fit the character perfectly. For Batman, a more grounded and realistic character in more grounded and realistic movies, it work against the look, feel, and tone of both the character and the movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'd either have white-out eyes that don't move and don't express emotion, which no filmmaker or actor would want, or you'd have animated white out eyes which would be goofy and cartoony. Either way, not appropriate for any remotely serious Batman movie.

<TEXT> It's not an issue of money. Of course Nolan and others have had the budget to white out the eyes; they don't want to for reasons posted throughout this thread, but mostly because the filmmakers want you to see the actor's real eyes. 

Also, because Batman is a more grounded, realistic comic book character compared to Deadpool, they took a more grounded, realistic approach to the look. The white, animated, expressive eyes in the Deadpool movie will look cartoony, and for Deadpool, that's perfect. For Batman, it would be laughable. 

Now I can't stop thinking of Batman: The Animated Series and the [infamous squint.](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif)  </TEXT>

Do I really have to spell this out? I'm talking about one aspect specifically. Superman's presence on a team is like having God with a team of lesser gods who each get maybe one or two of God's powers. It's redundant. That's the only point I was making. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's kind of my problem with Superman and the Justice League. The X-Men work because they're a team with a variety of powers. Yes, some are more powerful than others, but there aren't really much in the way of redundancies. 

Super strength? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct assistance), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, and the Flash (infinite mass punch anyone?). 

Flight? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter. 

Neigh-invulnerable? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct shielding), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter (more likely density shifts through it, but he's still physically tough), etc.

Super Speed? Superman and The Flash, although Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman are able to get to wherever they need to go quickly, including across vast expanses of space.

Justice League *with* Superman just seems kind of redundant. Superman is a one-man superhero team. </TEXT>

US did the same thing back in the 1930s to stop the dust bowls: "After the howling winds passed and the dust settled, federal foresters planted 100 million trees across the Great Plains, forming a giant windbreak  known as a shelterbelt  that stretched from Texas to Canada."

Actually this project was started first in Algeria in the 70's. It's called the green dam.You can see it in this picture http://imgur.com/E140PYS

They used to take the kids from school from all over the country to plant trees there once a year. Drafted soldiers participated too. The forests exist to this day, I remember finding mushrooms under the trees. You can even spot animals like rabbits there.

EDIT: and it does work and the best economical way to do it is to have the community participate in planting the trees.

This gets posted on TIL all of the time.

But nobody talks about the fact that it hasn't happened or probably never will happen.

They just like to reap that sweet repost karma instead of posting things they actually learned.

Love him or hate him, John cena makes kids wishes come true.

He legitimately cares about those kids.

I was at raw about a year ago, there was a kid there in a wheelchair in the crowd you could tell that he didn't jut break his leg. He was sitting pretty close and John cena threw his shirt, his hat, and I think his wristband things to this kid, everyone could tell it was for him and when someone near him caught it, cena would look at them and motion to pass it to the kid. Everyone did. It was really awesome.

Now I want Radiohead to cover Prince's Batdance in retaliation.

The Foo Fighters wanted to release a cover of Prince's "Darling Nikki" on a b-side, Prince told them that they couldn't due to copyright, so instead they just played it at shows for a while in the early 2000s. In retaliation, Prince played a cover of "Best of You" at the 2006 Super Bowl. However, his revenge didn't work out as planned, as Dave Grohl was stoked to get covered by one of his musical idols.

TL;DR Prince is a pretty reliable copyright dick

A fellow commenter claimed this movie was postmodern. I disagreed politely and explained my reasoning. If that's something considered a "dick move" by the Reddit masses, so be it. Negative Reddit karma isn't going to keep me up at night.

<TEXT> So glad you asked! I think Memento is postmodern in its depiction of life and memories. It supports the postmodern claim that truth is what we believe it to be, and memories are not reliable because we sometimes lie to ourselves, sometimes even unknowingly. The underlying idea is that 'real' truth does not exist. If postmodernism is, at its core, questioning the certainty of things, surely our own minds and the way we lie to ourselves is valid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Postmodernism *is* a vague category; it would be wholly ironic to try and define it with passionate certainty since that is exactly what postmodernism seeks to critique. That being said, I don't see it as a synonym for meta humor or any self-referential or self-aware comedy. That was the crux of my comment. I consider--as I suspect many do--that postmodernism carries deeper meaning than that. 

Obviously I haven't seen "A Deadly Adoption," but I would expect it to be like an hour-plus SNL sketch lampooning the Lifetime movie clich. If that's all it is, would you really categorize it as "postmodern?"

And let's say you would. Fuck me for having a contrary opinion? I have been under the impression that the point of these comments sections was for discussion. If everyone is going to just upvote everyone they agree with and comment the same thing worded differently, what's the point? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Explain to me how any of that was the least bit pretentious, rude, or how it could sound "awful." 

*I tend to reserve*

As in me, my opinion. Not saying the other chap is wrong, but here's what works for me. 

I list a number of fantastic films that I consider prime examples of how I interpret postmodernism. What a dick. I mean really, who does that? /r/movies is for discussing movies, not... discussing... movies?

Finally, I simply state the definition of postmodernism from which I am working so that /u/I_AM_LOOKING_AT_YOU and others can understand where I'm coming from, and then I offer another potentially more accurate term for the aforementioned Lifetime movie.

There's nothing "pretentious" about my post. I politely disagreed with someone and explained exactly why. If that's pretentious, you'd have an awfully hard time having any conversation that isn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but celery has "negative calories." 

As a plant, celery stores its calories throughout its body, just as every other plant does. There are plenty of food calories in celery; the difference is that humans cannot adequately process those calories.

The majority of energy that celery has locked within it passes through our digestive system without being processed. The cellulose calories celery has is irrelevant; all that counts is the six or so food calories we can get from each eight-inch stalk. Since it takes more than six food calories of energy to digest the celery, the net result is that digesting celery does, in fact, exhaust calories. In a very real sense, celery is a "negative calorie" food. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I believe that exposure to hyper-realistic violence in a controlled enviroment is a practical approach to parenting

Can you read that again and tell me you're actually being serious?

A four-year-old has no ability whatsoever to comprehend what he or she is seeing. Why would you show them at that young and impressionable age where they're still trying to make sense of the world people intentionally and purposefully doing wanton violence to one another? That's the impression you'd want a young child to have of the world? Just dash their innocence against the rocks right off the bat?

As for citing a source, I don't know how to narrow it down from [these 386,000](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=exposure+to+media+violence+children hl=en as_sdt=0 as_vis=1 oi=scholart sa=X ei=wlFsVYzBGMaagwTQtoP4CA ved=0CBwQgQMwAA), but feel free to pick the first three you like and peruse.

Here's a quote from the [first one](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-23323-000): Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley describe the reaction of the games industry to scientific findings that exposure to violent video games and other forms of media violence constitutes a significant risk factor for later aggressive and violent behavior.

Here's a more [recent one from 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285914003325): Child-reported media violence exposure was associated with physical aggression after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographics, family and community violence, and child mental health symptoms (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.17; video games, 0.15; music, 0.14). This association was significant and independent for television, video games, and music violence exposure in a model including all 3 media types (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.11; video games, 0.09; music, 0.09). There was a significant positive interaction between media time and media violence for video games and music but not for television. Effect sizes for the association of media violence exposure and physical aggression were greater in magnitude than for most of the other examined variables.

Here's another [recent study](http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/09/scan.nsv025.abstract): Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people to the emotional experience of others.

This really shouldn't surprise anybody. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The notion that hyper-realistic violence should not be exposed to children is utterly arbitrary

Not according to the many, MANY studies done on the subject, and your anecdote is meaningless; anecdotes are not evidence.

There are hundreds of thousands of studies I could link to supporting what I'm saying: a young child, a four-year-old, should *not* be exposed to the kind of violence depicted in Mortal Kombat.

Like I said, I'll take the downvotes, because fuck me for caring more about the welfare of children than... what? I don't even know why this warrants downvoting. I've been a fan of Mortal Kombat since the original hit arcades in 1992. I was eleven at the time. I've owned the home console version of all of them including X, but I don't play them in front of my now 5-year-old daughter because it would be grossly irresponsible bad parenting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I said in my original post, it's all about convenience. There are currently about 20-30 bottles of delicious water in my refrigerator at about 34 degrees F that I can grab and drink at my leisure. The containers are also convenient, because even if I'm on the go, I can crush them down to almost nothing and screw on the cap. They fit right in my pocket until I can find a proper receptacle. 

So, back to my original point, I use bottled water for the same reason I use floss picks rather than spool floss. Convenience is king. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't even consider it "soft" atheism. Atheism is just a-theism, i.e., without theism. I'm irreligious and I don't believe in god. That's what an atheist actually is, regardless of how many people try to define it on their own terms or make ridiculous line graphs. 

In other words, I'm not making any extraordinary claims. In spite of tons of reading, research, and opening myself up to many ideas, I see no evidence supporting the existence of god, nor do I see the need for one. I stop short of saying there is no god because that's impossible for me or anyone else to say meaningfully. There's no proof either way. 

God either exists and it's wrong to say god doesn't exist, or god doesn't exist and it's impossible to prove a negative. I can't prove pink unicorns that eat rainbows and shit butterflies *don't* exist, but it's perfectly reasonable for me to not believe in them.

Therefore, rationally, "I don't believe in god" is the only sensible statement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't fail to grasp anything. Either is wrong. You're making a statement of fact about something that cannot be proven. It makes no more sense to say God or gods exist than it does to say God or gods don't exist. 

The sensible thing to say is either "I don't believe in god" or "I don't believe in gods."

<TEXT> Neither is correct. 

Atheists don't believe in god, but in the same way that there is no evidence for god, one cannot disprove a negative. While I certainly don't believe in gods or anything else without proof, I nor anyone else can claim with 100% certainty that an improvable thing doesn't exist. That is logically impossible.

That being said, one should rationally say "I do not believe in god" rather than making any factual statement that they do not exist or cannot exist.

Taking that to OP's point, there is a semantic difference between "I don't believe in god" and "I don't believe in God." The capitalized "God" is a specific one, and, in the United States, most often assumed to mean the Abrahamic God, an even more specifically, the Christian trinity god based on demographics. An lower-case "god" could refer generically to any god, goddess, or similar deity and is therefore a perfectly reasonable substitute. You don't need to pluralize "gods" any more than you'd need to say, "I don't believe in God, god, gods, goddesses, or deities of any kind."  </TEXT>

Really? Because here's what you *actually* wrote:

Exactly, making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing. Some people don't seem to get that it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy".

making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing

How is making Sue black *less* confusing? The only way her not being black could be construed as confusing is if you didn't grasp the incredibly simple concept of adoption or step siblings. This isn't hard.

fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy"

The only "fucking with the characters" (no apostrophe needed there) the filmmaker has done was to make Johnny Storm black, so that's you thinking black = "edgy."

I'm not the one in need of reading comprehension courses. If anyone needs an education here, it's you. </TEXT>

EDIT 1: Which movie version of Horton Hears a Who! did the Grinch appear in? There are two.

EDIT 2: Actually, I have to insist this theory sticks to the books only as there have been two Horton movies and two Grinch movies. The movies contradict themselves and it cannot be sensibly said that one is canon while the other is not. This is strictly a book theory. </TEXT>

The ones who religiously watch Marvel movies do. Nolan's trilogy was hugely popular and did ridiculous box office numbers, and although opinions vary, Man of Steel did very well for itself too.

It's okay if Marvel and DC have different approaches; they both have their audience.

I would also expect that some of their movies, like The Flash, will be a little lighter in tone. </TEXT>

I was actually thinking of going there because there's not even a slight reference to Jesus or anything Christian in the Grinch book or the movies, but the timing wouldn't make sense.

Horton Hears a Who! takes place from May 15th-16th and Christmas in Whoville is definitely in the winter. Assuming their holiday would be on the anniversary of their contact with the outside world, it should be May 16th, late spring. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, the eponymous character is motivated to end Christmas because he cannot bear the noise made by the Whos in Whoville. Their traditions involve making an incredible amount of noise.

In Horton Hear a Who, we learn that the Whos are tiny people-like creatures living on a dust speck which Horton takes upon himself to protect. When he almost fails and the Whos are threatened with having their whole world boiled in Beezlenut oil, Horton encourages them all to make noise so that they sour kangaroo can hear them and confirm their existence.

Whos associate collective loud noise making with their triumph and survival in their darkest hour.

**EDIT**: This theory is based on the two books referenced and not the four movies (two each) based on the books. </TEXT>

****ALMOST*** verbatim, as in ***NOT*** verbatim, but similar. It's called "hyperbole." You'll find it's fairly common on the internet. You're not being attacked, so lower the defenses. You're not a bad guy, a stupid guy, or whatever else you managed to infer offense from.

<TEXT> Probably, but stages of development are so incredibly varied that they can be terribly difficult to pin down; "milestones" are horribly misleading. It's entirely possible for a child to be remarkably behind his or her peers in kindergarten and then go on to be top of his or her class just a few years later. There are so many factors and variables, I don't put much stalk in milestones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not understanding your logic.

If climate change is real, largely man-made, and reversible, the opposition funding climate change denial is profit motivated because whatever they're selling--fossil fuels, etc.--is the leading cause of the problem.

The other side--solar panel producers, the makers of windmills, etc.--have a profit motive, which is to sell things that reduce carbon emissions and thereby reduce pollution.

I get *their* motivations, but what sensible person prefers we continue to burn fossil fuels, produce carbon emissions, and continue to pollute at reckless levels? What's the downside to reducing pollution? </TEXT>

Orwell got it right in that surveillance, control of media, information, history, and ideas through propaganda works.

<TITLE> I recently posted an explanation of Jay Garrick. Due to requests, here's one for Wally West   Bart Allen. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-20 14:54:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was recently asked to do a Wally West   Bart Allen one, so here that is for anyone curious:

Sure, and The Flash extended family goes even beyond that, but Wally   Bart should be easy enough.

Wally West goes way back to 1959. There was a very powerful trend in DC Comics to give their marque superheroes a child sidekick, and The Flash was no exception, so [Wally West was introduced as "Kid Flash."](http://i.imgur.com/OowRBRA.jpg) 

Barry was dating Iris West at the time and Wally was her nephew. As if the costume isn't unoriginal enough, he got his powers because the exact same accident that gave Barry his powers happened to Wally.

Barry sacrificed himself in the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1986. Wally gave up the Kid Flash moniker and replaced The Flash, but this was also a way for the editorial staff to nerf the character a bit, as he had become OP as fuck over the years. He could no longer go faster-than-light, but rather the speed of sound and sometimes a bit beyond, much like our CW Barry. 

Wally eventually came across Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne) and had to up his game, so OPAF Flash returned because he had to match Eobard's speed. Sometime during the 90s, the concept of "Speed Force" was introduced by Mark Waid, which became the go-to explanation of expanded powers and general fuckery that couldn't otherwise be made sense of. With the variety set of new powers, Speed Force as a way of explaining anything, and the ability to go faster-than-light, it has been argued by some, quite logically, that The Flash is actually more powerful and more OP than Superman.

As of the Flashpoint/New 52 event, Barry Allen is the only Flash to have ever existed in mainstream continuity, but they have shown Wally West in the future. He's now biracial and [sports a new costume.](http://i.imgur.com/WlY1dv4.jpg)

Bart Allen, in pre-Flashpoint 52 continuity, would be the fourth to become The Flash after Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West. [He debuted as Impulse in 1994](http://i.imgur.com/DRUfBsS.jpg) and later became Kid Flash. He's a descendant of Barry Allen and Iris West, but is also a Thawne. Just like Wally West was a sidekick "Kid Flash" to Barry Allen, Bart Allen was a sidekick to Wally West.

Bart Allen even got to be the fourth Flash in his own series ever-so-briefly but was [killed off](http://i.imgur.com/M2OT1Io.png) in 2006 only to be brought back as [Kid Flash in 2009](http://i.imgur.com/mtYf3pJ.jpg) thanks to an event called Final Crisis. 

After the continuity reshuffle of Flashpoint and the New 52, he was a time-displaced [Kid Flash](http://i.imgur.com/VwWk678.jpg) with the Teen Titans with some serious amnesia problems.

<TEXT> [Jay Garrick was the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/M2VD5ug.jpg) He was [cancelled in 1951](http://i.imgur.com/jyzFIvH.jpg) as superhero comics were waning. 

[Barry Allen was a reboot in 1956](http://i.imgur.com/xOzQpVu.jpg), an attempt to revive a classic character. [Jay Garrick existed to Barry Allen as a comic book character.](http://i.imgur.com/9er8eTm.jpg) Eventually, DC thought it would be cool to have the two meet, so to explain this, they were both [The Flash of two different worlds.](http://i.imgur.com/E3JsTF0.jpg) 

Flash forward to 1976, Jay Garrick and other old-timey comic book characters were brought back in the parallel world's answer to the Justice League: [The Justice Society.](http://i.imgur.com/LIYkZWa.jpg)

In 1985, DC Comics had one of the biggest events in comic book history called ***CRISIS*** on Infinite Earths. You'll recall The Flash [disappearing in a ***CRISIS***](http://i.imgur.com/Nii95UB.jpg) in Eobard's newspaper from the future. This event merged all the parallel worlds of DC Comics into one, so Jay Garrick was retconned as having [always existed in the same world as Barry Allen and was in fact his predecessor, the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/uQ8Bkbz.jpg)

After an event called Flashpoint where [The Flash goes back in time to save his mother from getting murdered by The Reverse Flash](http://i.imgur.com/kBFQbl8.jpg)  (sound familiar?), DC Comics had itself another reboot establishing the New 52, which, among other things, [merged some of their imprints like Vertigo, WildStorm, Milestone, etc., into mainstream continuity](http://i.imgur.com/2x35VNA.jpg) and just generally messed around with continuity with mixed results. 

Many of DC's "legacy characters" are now featured in "Earth 2," again establishing multiple worlds. [Jay Garrick is The Flash of Earth 2](http://i.imgur.com/4rmSaSu.jpg), just like he was way back in the 60s.

If anyone has anything to add/clarify/correct, please weigh-in. I know I left a lot out, but my goal was an abridged breakdown of the essentials for the uninformed, not a comprehensive guide. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [SPOILER] Time Travel Paradoxes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-20 04:16:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The strange thing with all this time travel is the paradoxes it necessarily creates. Eddie killed himself, so Eobard was never born, but he only disappears from existence at the time when Eddie killed himself. If he was never born, he never would have existed at all, meaning he never could have gone back in time to kill Barry's mom, blow up the particle accelerator, etc., and no one would have any memory of him because he'd have never existed.

But what's really fucky for me is that Eobard was from a different timeline than Eddie, so Eddie's sacrifice should have only affected *his* future. As soon as Eobard went back in time and killed Barry's mother, he created a new timeline--one that he was stuck in. I would assume the Eddie of *his* timeline, the one he traveled back in time from, is alive and well.

Remember, they have 100% established that going back in time creates a new timeline. Eobard confirmed that when he commented on Cisco's ability to remember what happened to him in another timeline. 

So... what if Eddie didn't kill Eobard; he just wanted them to believe he had. We know the wormhole came back, but we don't know what triggered it. Perhaps Eobard never needed the time machine; after all, he didn't have one when he traveled back to kill Barry. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why wouldn't Batman master magic? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-18 20:16:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I sometimes read comments or entire threads dedicated to the fact that Batman not only has Tony Stark style money and resources but has literally been shown to have cybernetic armor suits on par or superior to any Iron Man suit, so why in the hell does he go without? That's usually met with a variety of answers trying to explain something that really doesn't make much sense, but what about magic?

It is an established fact that the DC Universe--possibly all of them--has magic. Unlike the armor, you can't say "it's not his style" because his style has consistently been to master the crap out of everything, know everything, be the best there is at everything. 

Not only would magic be hugely useful in a number of practical ways, but it would also help him with threats like Superman who are vulnerable to magic (we're talking about a guy who keeps Kyptonite in his utility belt). If the JLA encountered a magical threat, they'd have an ace up their sleeve because Bruce studied the dark arts. 

Anybody got an answer for this? </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I'm having trouble with the concept of cutie marks   pony names. Maybe /r/mylittlepony can help... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-06 01:46:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There seems to be a sort of conflation of ideas in that they either reflect your personality/skills and come about accordingly, as evidenced by The Cutie Mark Crusaders trying to "earn" theirs. 

They also seem to suggest that they tell you your destiny, as evidenced by that song/episode "What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me" where the Mane Six had theirs swapped.

What I don't get is names. Rainbow Dash, for example, had the words Rainbow and Dash in her name presumably since birth and she grows up to be the one who can pull off a sonic rainboom or whatever? The name "Dash" connotes speed. You could easily write off the rainbow part if the parents didn't name her until she was born and they noticed the color scheme, but unless they were prescient, they couldn't have known her destiny. 

The same is true of Fluttershy. Her name rhymes with her cutie mark--a butterfly--and she's shy. These are details her parents couldn't have possibly known about her when she was born.

I considered that maybe parents don't name their kids until these facts are established, but not only do the Cutie Mark Crusaders have names, but the infant children of the baker parents have names. 

So what's the deal? Are the parents blessed with some sort of precognition when it comes to naming their offspring? How do foals coincidentally end up with names that represent them every bit as well as their eventual cutie marks do? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-23 18:21:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My main question concerns Germany and Japan. Did Japan actually treat their POWs the worst? 

[From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Crimes)

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.[40] The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher becauseunder a directive ratified on August 5, 1937 by Emperor Hirohitothe constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.[41] Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the surrender of Japan.[42] After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.[43] Around 1,536 U.S. civilians were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment in Japanese internment camps in the Far East; by comparison, 883 U.S. civilians died in German internment camps in Europe.[44] </TEXT>

<TEXT> My thesis is that building a successful military depends primarily on three factors: motivations of patriotism/nationalism/jingoism, political motivation/will, and of course, the professional expertise to execute plans.

This is as far as democratic/free societies go; of course a dictatorship will simply build military might as they see fit.

**EDIT**: So the consensus seems to be that 

1. I'm an idiot.

2. I'm screwed.

3. Get a second opinion on the estimate.

I guess I'll get the second opinion, and I guess I can't sue this guy, but now I gotta figure out what to do with this car if I don't want to pay the three grand to fix it (I don't).

<TITLE> Wait... how old is Batman? The New 52 many Robins problem. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-13 20:54:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The easy method is Batman's birthday, 1985 deduced from Batman #010, Year Zero Directors Cut. Bruce Wayne is Born. (Date inferred Willowood and Wayne Death correlations. Willowood fell into disrepute after Martha died when Bruce was 10, but it was likely not that long after, and the sickhole happened 18 years ago. This also correlates to Bruce taking off as soon as possible, 18, which is consistent with everything else.) 

Thomas   Martha are murdered when Bruce is 10 in 1995. Damian is born in 1999 (Batman   Robin #0) somehow even though Bruce Wayne would only be 14 and doesn't leave Gotham until 2000 (Batman #0). Bruce returns to Gotham in 2004 (Detective Comics #0). He's now 19. Damian would be 5 going by this insanity.

In 2005, Bruce is a vigilante trying to save Gotham City from The Red Hood and his gang (Batman #0).

2006: Tim Drake attends Graystone Academy (in Middle School) as their top academic student and is taking gymnastics. He hacked the school's network and caught the principal embezzling funds and turned him in. At the exact same time, Jason Todd robbed a convenience store with a friend(?) who shot a scared woman. Jason in moral outrage beat his friend(?) down and allowed himself to be arrested. The Bat-Signal is lit by Commissioner Gordon for the first time. Dick Grayson's parents fall to their death due to Tony Zucco tampering with the trapeze equipment. Dick is then sent to an orphanage, The Wayne Care Center. (Batman #0)

That ***same year*** Dick Grayson becomes Robin. (Nightwing #1).

That ***same year*** Barbara Gordon becomes Batgirl.

So Bruce Wayne has been active one year as a vigilante and already has a kid sidekick and inspired a female crime fighter.

2007: Barbara gives up being Batgirl after only one year to focus on college. (Batgirl #0)

2008: Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke* happens, officially NewFiftyTwoniverse Cannon. As a reminder, Batman is apparently 23 in this book. Damian is 9 and still unknown to his father.

2009: Jason Todd resurrected. When exactly he died or became Robin is hard to figure out, but it couldn't have been for very long. Damian Wayne defeats his mother in a birthday challenge and learns Bruce Wayne is his father. Batman is 24, Damian is 10, so yes, somehow Bruce fathered Damian when he was 14 with a woman he'd never met a good six or seven years before he became Batman. WTF?

2010: The events of Batman, Inc #0 take place.

2011: The "present" of the New52 launch in most titles which has advanced generally in real time since.

So Batman/Bruce Wayne is roughly 29 and has managed to have four Robins in a vigilante/costumed adventurer/superhero career of about nine years. By DC compressing decades of continuity to keep all these characters they've built and established, Batman has Dick Greyson as a costumed sidekick almost immediately, loses him when Dick starts the first Titans--vaguely referenced in Red Hood   The Outlaws--Batman almost instantly replaces Dick with Jason who must then die almost the next day, then he gets replaced by Tim who goes off and forms the current Teen Titans, and then Damian comes along, who Bruce apparently fathered at age 14 because that makes sense.

DC Comics has created a clusterfuck of plotholes in their new timeline.

***EDIT***

To offer what would make more sense if I was running this shit:

Martha   Thomas murdered when Bruce is 10.

Bruce returns to Gotham at age 18 after training all over the world. He does the masked vigilante bullshit for about a year, has little luck, is about to give it up when ***BAM!!!*** the bat thing happens and he's inspired. Becomes Batman, a complete badass but inexperienced. Suit is too armored because he's not too good at dodging bullets yet, and he relies too heavily on Alfred and technology to get by. 19-year-old Batman is nothing like the Batman we know and love, but DC sells his stories in the monthly back-in-the-day series called "Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight." These stories are interesting because we see a flawed Batman who doesn't always win his fights, fucks up, fails, and hasn't mentally killed off Bruce Wayne yet. He's still trying to balance Bruce and the bat because he hasn't realized he needs to sacrifice his life to become the hero Gotham needs.

Five years later, Batman is getting insanely good. He's dropped a lot of the tech and armor in favor of lightweight, stealth, ninja shit. He looks more like a ninja than a stealth, militaristic man-tank. Alfred is there when he needs him, but Bruce is much more capable on his own and far less reliant on tech and gear. He's also established now. Criminals fear him and Gordon is with him rather than against him, plus, Gordon has been promoted through the ranks and is now commissioner. The Bat Signal scares the shit out of people and is a hallmark of Gotham. Batman is only 24, but 5 years in, Batman is already the stuff of legend. However, Batman has steadily taken the place of Bruce Wayne. Alfred reminds Bruce of an obligation. He attends Haly's Circus and witnesses the death of 10-year-old Dick Grayson's parents. Relates hard. Epic feels. Takes in kid as ward. Feels bad man.

Over the next year, Dick puts the pieces together. Witnesses Alfred doing his medical shit for Bruce after a bad night. Last shreds of doubt are gone: shitty fake rich dad man is Batman. Dick sees Batman as the means to get revenge on Tony Zucco. Bruce takes him under his wing, trains him, and Robin: The Boy Wonder is born. Batman is 25, Robin is only 11. They are the Dynamic Duo, forming one of the greatest relationships in comics. DC sells the stores of this time period as Robin: The Boy Wonder. Great comic. Such sales. When Dick is 16, they have a falling out. Five years of Batman   Robin comes to an end at Dick goes off to found the original Teen Titans. Batman grows dark as shit without Robin to balance him out. Batman is now 30. 

Also noteworthy: the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, begins and ends in this time period. When Batgirl first appears, Batman is 26, Robin is 12, and Barbara is 17. Batman disapproves, Robin crushes hard. The three end up making a sensational team. When Batman figures out Batgirl is Barbara Gordon, he's crippled by guilt. Batgirl operates for four years, quitting at 21 only to be shot through the spine by The Joker in a home invasion because The Killing Joke is cannon forever. 30-year-old Batman is mentally broken by this incident, and it drives Dick away. He's losing his shit.

At age 22, Barbara Gordon becomes The Oracle, an essential part of Batman's operation and lending support to Dick's Teen Titans. Batman is now 31. Bruce and Dick speak to each other only through Barbara and are otherwise estranged. Dick is now Nightwing. At age 23, Oracle founds The Birds of Prey, passing on the Batgirl identity to either Cassandra Cain. She also works closely with her best friend and ally The Black Canary, Stephanie Brown AKA: The Spoiler, and Helena Bertinelli AKA: The Huntress. Batman is now 32 and a 15-year-old kid named Tim Drake has figured out his identity.

Tim Drake is obsessed with Batman   Robin. Batgirl, too. He's a boy genius, a black belt, the top student in his school, and has hacking skills second only to Barbara. He wants to be the new Robin, and nothing Bruce says or does as Bruce or Batman will change his mind. Barbara tricks Bruce and Dick into meeting. Bruce eventually reveals the Tim Drake problem, and Dick says he already knows. How? Barbara. Dick surprises Bruce by encouraging him to take the boy under his wing like he did for him because Batman needs a Robin, but it can't be Dick anymore. 

Batman has a Robin again. Batman is 33. Tim is 16, the same age Dick was when he left Bruce's side. DC explores these stories in the ongoing Batman   Robin comic as well as Gotham Knights, a book featuring the dream team of Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Oracle, and other Gotham vigilantes inspired by Batman like Huntress, The Spoiler, Catwoman, Batwoman, etc.

You'll notice Jason Todd didn't exist. No one other than Dick   Tim have ever been Robin, and if Damian Wayne is going to be introduced, it hasn't happened yet but could down the line, preferably around the same time Bruce is either about to die or retire so Dick can become Batman and Damian his Robin.

Realistically, Batman either dies in the line of duty before he ever makes it to 40 or retires to be replaced by Dick Grayson either way.

I'm sorry, but you don't just go through sidekicks like dirty laundry. It's ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have an idea. My wife doing what she does for a living (outreach therapist) gets exposed to all these kids who get flat out rejected by their own families for being gay. Some get kicked out, others are simply made to feel like they're less-than-human, others want to kill themselves upon finding themselves unloved by their own families, etc.

That's all a whole lot of bullshit.

So I want to start an orphanage of sorts. Anyone from anywhere in the US finds themselves in one of these shitty situations, they can move into the Jackson Pride: A Sanctuary for LGBT Youth. Until they're 18, they'd have a safe place to stay where they are loved and supported by a staff made up of LGBT and LGBT-friendly people such as myself.

I'd need a shitload of money. It'd have to be grants and charitable donations because I can't see any way to make such a thing profitable. Does anyone have the first clue where to start on a thing like this? This might be my calling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before anyone corrects me, I'm not claiming this is The Great Gatsby: A Phantom Menace. But...

Aside from names, it's basically what logically happens before The Great Gatsby. 

Jay Gatsby is Dexter. 

Comes from middle class family. Father owns the second-best grocery store in town.

Aspires to be part of the old money, upper crust elite.

Meets Judy/Daisy.

Loves her. Loses her because she's old money elite; he's not. 

Couple of affairs.

Loser in love. Goes to war as we know Gatsby did. Never forgets her.

He returns. Gets filthy rich. Success. Still loves Judy/Daisy. Finds out from a friend that she's married now and the guy is a dick. Name is Joe Simms but he sounds an awful lot like Tom Buchanan. He cheats on her just like Tom. She doesn't cheat. She stays home with the kids.

He's still alive at the end and very much contemplating the Judy/Daisy situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Batman and all his allies defending Gotham City featuring Batman (Bruce Wayne), Robin (Damian Wayne), Red Robin (Timothy Drake), Nightwing (Dick Grayson), Spoiler (Stephanie Brown), Batgirl (Cassandra Caine), Oracle (Barbara Gordon), Huntress (Helena Bertinelli), The Red Hood (Jason Todd), Catwoman (Selina Kyle), Black Canary (Dinah Lance), Katana (Tatsu Yamashiro), Cheshire (Jade Nguyen), Batwoman (Katie Kane), Ragman (Rory Regan), and maybe even some variation of Azrael and/or Batwing.

Additional cast featuring Alfred, Lucius Fox, Commissioner Gordon, Rene Montoya, Detective Alvarez, Harvey Bullock, Harvey Dent, Maggie Sawyer, Leslie Thompkins, and Vicki Vale.

You don't have to get all detailed about each character's origins or how they ended up where they are, and it'd be largely based on Morrison's "Batman, Inc." run, which means it involves Talia's all-out assault on Gotham, a call to arms of all Batman's allies, Bruce Wayne is out as Batman's financial backer, Damian dies, and there's a fuckload of cameos. Three-hour epic.

I'm geeking out so hard right now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gatsby is black </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-07 01:50:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As insane as this sounds, I've done the research. It's plausible. The idea isn't original; it was first proposed by Carlyle Thompson, a professor of African American and American literature at Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. There's actually quite a bit of evidence to support it, just as there is to support the queer reading of Nick.

Gatsby is described by Nick, "his tanned skin" and "short hair look as though it were trimmed every day" (Fitzgerald 50). The short hair and the appearance of daily trimmings could definitely refer to the grooming habits of African American men.

Gatsby's West Egg mansion is on "more than 40 acres of lawn and garden" (Fitzgerald 5), which is specifically interesting, because freed slaves were to be given 40 acres and a mule by decree of Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15. "More than" is stated, but instead of giving us that exact number--it could be 41 acres or 400--but we're given 40. It should be noted that 40 acres and a mule was oft promised, but a promise not always kept and inconsistently applied (Oubre 79). There's an obvious metaphor for a man who feels deserving of something he doesn't get, i.e., Daisy.

Gatsby would be unlikely to achieve the level of success he did in the roaring 20s if he were black, and some of the upper-crust white folk would be likely to notice or take issue with his race, so it's only a plausible theory if he were able to pass himself off as white. There is evidence for this, too. For one, the manner in which he makes his fortune is bootlegging during prohibition, and bootlegging is a sort of counterfeit product. That could be a metaphor as Gatsby is a counterfeit person. He pretends to be someone he's not, he seeks an imagined perfection of a flawed woman, he lies about his past, he's secretive about what he does and his intentions, and being a man of color could be just one more lie he's living. He's even changed his name from Gatz to Gatsby, something more Nordic-sounding.

Gatsby is quite proud of his heroism in Montenegro. Of all the places he could have earned a medal, it's one where the word "negro" is right in the name--negro/black, mont/mountain--and it's mentioned by name seven times immediately like Fitzgerald wanted it to stand out. Also, his valor at Montenegro was immediately proved true by the medal Gatsby carried around. In other words, Gatsby lies, but the "negro" part is the truth.

How do we know he lies? He just told us on the previous page, "I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West--all dead now" (Fitzgerald 65). We know for a fact later on that his father remains alive and is far-from-wealthy. Was his family dead, or was he dead to his family on account of his color? "I was brought up in American but educated at Oxford, becaue all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It's a family tradition" (Fitzgerald 65). He's awfully concerned with establishing a European heritage.

But here's the passage that really blew my mind with this reading:

        ...a limousine passed us, driven by a white
        chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
        laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
        haughty rivalry.

        "Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought;
        "anything at all. . . ."

        Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. (Fitzgerald 69)

First, let's note that this happens as they are crossing Blackwell's island. Again, a geographical location is used that denotes "black."

According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, "Modish" means "Conforming to or following what is currently popular and fashionable." In other words, these are African American men who turned the social paradigm on its head and are being driven by a white chauffeur. In spite of a possible slave heritage, they are able to afford the luxuries of the time, looking at Gatsby, his ride, and his present company with a sense of rivalry. If these black men are able to realize the American dream, surely a man of African descent who can pass for white can achieve this success. Yes, anything is possible, even Gatsby. Even a black Gatsby.

There are smaller clues, too. After Myrtle is struck by a car, the incoherent speech of a man is "M-a-v-r-o----," which is interesting, because "mavro" is Greek for "black."

One the same page, a "pale well-dressed negro" described the car, Gatsby's car, as "big" and "yellow." Now back to the Montenegro thing, which literally means "black mountain," which may describe Gatsby, big and yellow may also describe him as "high yellow" was a term to describe light-skinned blacks, the product of mixed race backgrounds due to the golden skin tone (Dalzell, 2009). He may be a "black mountain" of a man, but he's also "high" like a mountain, but, although technically black, also "yellow."

Is this a meaningless distinction? No. It's not trivial at all. Tom Buchanan is an awful human being, and we're treated to Tom's racist rant:

        Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard? . . . Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved. . . Well, these books are all scientific . . . This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things . . . This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and . . . and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that. (Fitzgerald 12-13)

How are we supposed to feel about this? Well, Daisy openly mocks him and Nick says he's pathetic. Tom believes that the Nordics are the master race and that it's imperative for him and people like him to keep the colored folk down. Wouldn't there then be great irony on his wife's competing love with a non-Nordic person? A black Gatsby?

It's at least a suspicion on Tom's part when he puts the pieces together and outs his fears:

        I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. (Fitzgerald 130)

        "We're all white here," murmured Jordan. (Fitzgerald 130)

Not only does Tom suggest that Gatsby is black, Jordan picks up on it and defends his whiteness! Why else would intermarriage between black and white even be brought up? He may have even suspected this for a long time before, pausing before he includes Daisy as a Nordic in the Goddard rant with a wink and a smile when he lays out the Goddard nonsense. Perhaps he sees her as sullied having had her history with Gatsby.

The trouble is, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Fitzgerald was both a racist and antisemitic (Blogger.com 2010). That really changes the perspective. That underscores what Fitzgerald's true intentions were in the Goddard passage from the book, actually The Rising Tide of Color: Against White World-Supremacy, by eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, published in 1920 (Turlish 1973). Fitzgerald was obviously familiar with it. It's even more interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Stoddard had the same publisher, Scribner. As for the name change, Henry H. Goddard was a famous eugenicist (Thompson 2004). The plot thickens.

It forces one to consider that Gatsby is a cautionary figure, that negro men could be among us, passing themselves off as white, throwing lavish parties, living the lifestyle, wooing our women, acting as elaborate con artists, bootlegging, and involved in all manner of illicit affairs. Maybe that's the real reason he doesn't win in the end. Maybe that's why he's killed, as white men conspire against him. Maybe that's the real reason no one shows up to his funeral.

* Don't like the gym? Don't limit yourself to it. Run, bike, skateboard, Rollerblade, jog, dance, swim, climb, join a sports team/league, etc.
    

* Find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. Someone asks you to lunch at 12:30pm on Friday? Nope. That's your scheduled gym time. Take a rain-check.
    

* Sign up for classes. Exercise doesn't have to mean treadmills, ellipticals, or weights. Try new things, meet new people, and have fun. Try yoga. Try zumba. Try boot camp. Try core training. Try belly dancing and/or pole dancing if you must. Be adventurous.
    

* Have a run first thing in the morning when you wake up. It'll jolt you to life, give you more energy, almost guarantee you'll make time for a healthy breakfast, and once you're showered, you'll be good to go, probably in a better mood to boot. Go get life.
   

* Meet a friend at your scheduled gym at scheduled times or activities so you'd feel bad leaving them hanging. Tell that friend to give you a hard time if you skip a day or slack.
    
* Don't feel like going? Go. Tell yourself you'll phone it in today. Tell yourself you'll take it easy. Showing up is half the battle. Once you're there, you'll probably feel like you might as well get a good workout in if you're there anyway.
    
* Set realistic goals for yourself. Put them down on paper.


* Skip escalators and stairs, walk or ride your bike if it's not too far, park further away from the grocery store, and find other little ways to work in extra exercise into your daily life.


* Reward yourself for meeting goals/expectations, but not with cake and pies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you prefer one above all others? Do some ethnicities do things or have characteristics that you find sexy or a turn-off? Were you consciously trying to have sex with a variety of races? How would you rate your experiences overall?

Curious because I'm a married white male who has only had sex with white women, not by choice, but because New Hampshire is a very white place. I assume I'll die never having known the difference, assuming there are any. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Booster Gold   Blue Beetle! Hollywood is missing out on a great opportunity to make a superhero/comic book movie that is completely unlike the rest, and actually use it to satire superhero/comic book movies. It could have plenty of action, but also a lot of comedy, and more bromance than JD   Turk in a season of Scrubs. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A friend posted in our local (San Antonio) Facebook forum asking advice for overcoming writer's block. People seemed to like my response, so I thought I'd share:

You're over-thinking it. Stop. A*** A**** has great advice, but if you're not in the reading mood, don't do that either. Don't do anything, writing especially. If you're a comedian, funny things will come to you. You have a gift for being able to see the comedy in situations people experience every day of their lives, but they either don't see it or make the normal choice not to make a big deal of it. That's YOUR job.

If nothing is coming to you, don't panic. This is a great time to pull out your old jokes. If they're in a notebook, transcribe them to a Word document or otherwise create a document you can organize. Re-read your jokes. Try to approach those jokes from different angles. Figure out a way to connect jokes where some continuity may exist for good transitions. If you need better transitions, write those.

Think of that time some dumb drunk bitch said some dumb drunk bitch thing during your set. Now think of what you wish you had said to her. Maybe it's about her being a dumb drunk bitch. Now you have heckler ammo in your pocket.

Write and re-write your old shit and before you know it, you'll be writing new shit because you just inspired yourself to write and be creative.

If you car won't start, you give it a jump. That's all you need. The car is fucking fine.

She's an artist, very into dance, music, or any kind of art, really. It doesn't have to be anything like that, either, just a fun night out on the town.

I haven't lived here long enough to know where to go/what to do. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why churches should pay taxes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-26 06:23:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ***Tax exemptions for churches violate the separation of church and state*** enshrined in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. By providing a financial benefit to religious institutions, government is supporting religion. Associate Justice of the US Supreme court, William O. Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, decided May 4, 1970, stated: "If believers are entitled to public financial support, so are nonbelievers. A believer and nonbeliever under the present law are treated differently because of the articles of their faith I conclude that this tax exemption is unconstitutional."

***A tax exemption is a privilege, not a right.*** Governments have traditionally granted this privilege to churches because of the positive contribution they are presumed to make to the community, but there is no such provision in the US Constitution.

***Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive***, and such favoritism is unconstitutional. While secular charities are compelled to report their income and financial structure to the IRS using Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax), churches are granted automatic exemption from federal income tax without having to file a tax return.

***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines. As Mark Twain argued: "no church property is taxed and so the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income thus caused."

***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, and the Constitution bars government from subsidizing religion.*** William H. Rehnquist, then-Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): "Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income."

***The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup "faiths,"*** which benefit at taxpayers' expense. In spring 2010, Oklahoma awarded tax exempt status to Satanist group The Church of the IV Majesties. In Mar. 2004, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that "exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend "seminars." The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a "thriving cult of greed and power" and "a hugely profitable global racket," was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this "saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes." 

***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, so their tax exemptions are not justified. Tax exemptions to secular nonprofits like hospitals and homeless shelters are justified because such organizations do work that would otherwise fall to government. Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.

***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, which it cannot afford, especially in tough economic times. According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a "megachurch" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.

***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, many churches are clearly political and therefore should not be receiving tax exemptions***. Every fall, the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group, organizes "Pulpit Freedom Sunday," encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the "liberal media" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: "I'm going to explain to you what happened Nothing happened."

***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors***, whose lavish "megachurches" accumulate millions of tax-free dollars every year. US Senator Chuck Grassley, MA (R-IA) launched an investigation into these groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000, marble-topped chest of drawers installed in the 150,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton, Missouri.

***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates***. As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, pastor of Maryland's Broadview Church, "when Christians speak, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place." 

***The "parsonage exemption" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense.*** The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000. In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth, TX, live in a church-owned, tax-free $6.2 million lakefront parsonage.

If he went back out, same nasty-ass socks with all that same sweat and bacteria now going back in the same nasty-ass shoes. 

Then I realized A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THIS!!!

Fresh socks every time, people, and when you're not wearing shoes, remove socks. Bleach the white ones. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best and worst of every DC Bat-comic </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-11 17:14:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **THE BEST**

Batgirl started off weak in my opinion but grew on my quickly.

Batman started strong and stayed strong. It's one of the best books DC publishes.

Batman and _________ (formerly "Batman   Robin") instantly had me hooked, but it's gotten weird since Damian died. Batman has been increasingly more and more out-of-character, but I'm holding out hope it leads somewhere.

Batman Incorporated... you love Grant Morrison or you hate him. I'm glad I toughed it out. It's a slow burn, but it's so worth it.

Earth 2 is one title I wanted to hate from the day they announced it. Turns out I love it and highyl anticipate each issue.

Legends of the Dark Knight is one title I was so happy they brought back in its original non-canonical fuck-all form. Yeah, as a collection of stories, it's inconsistent in art and writing, but when it's on, it's on.

**THE MIDDLE**

Batman Beyond Unlimited has actually been mostly good, but I've stopping collecting simply out of disinterest.

Batwing is one I've wanted to quit repeatedly, and I hated the look of the character from the beginning, but there was always something keeping me. Just as I was about to drop the title, they brought in the new Batwing, who looks fucking amazing, and now I'm curious again. Nicely played, DC.

Batwoman isn't going to be for everyone, and I kept getting confused and frustrated, but it rewards patience, and I still believe it's got the best art/panel layouts in the business.

Talon was actually pretty good, and I gave it a few issues, but I couldn't bring myself to give a shit about the character. He seemed like just another Batman knock-off, and there's plenty. Besides, I was amazed by how shitty he looked. They had so many cool variations of the Talons and that's the design they went with?

**THE WORST**

Ame-Comi Girls intrigued me, but I'm jumping off after the Jade issue. It's pretty stupid.

Batman: Li'l Gotham isn't terrible, and it's really cute, but it's not really my thing.

Batman: The Dark Knight started off awful and continues to be awful as of issue 19. I'm been wanting to jump off since the first shitty issue, but I keep hoping it'll get better. It doesn't.

Birds of Prey started shitty and then seemed to challenge itself to get progressively shittier with every issue. They succeeded. None of their teased plot twists were enough to keep me on board.

Catwoman I almost quit repeatedly, but I got re-invested with the JLA storyline. Kitty is on a short leash.

Detective Comics: I have to stop buying this shitty comic just because of its title. It should be the flagship title of DC (Detective Comics), but it's garbage. It's been confusing, muddled, shitty shit since the first issue.

Justice League, like Detective Comics, should be one of DC's star attractions. Instead, it's a monthly clusterfuck. They couldn't even commit to the core roster, like everyone expected, which includes Cyborg, a character so fucking interesting he doesn't even have his own monthly. Thanks for overcharging for the several pages of Justice League and then Shazam's never-ending origin story stapled to the back. Is he ever actually joining the team and/or getting his own title, or is this basically Justice League/Shazam forever?

Justice League of America, the C-list of the Justice League (assuming International was the B-list) has managed to do jack shit in 3 issues, even requiring other titles for back-story and exposition. Another issue or two and I'll decide if it's worth continuing.

Nightwing is a character I love and I still had to drop this title. It started off shitty, got shittier, improved, and then went right back to shitty. I guess I'll never know what happens in Chicago.

Red Hood   The Outlaws is a title I fully expected to love. I... can't... get... into it. I seem to enjoy Jason more when he appears in other books. He'd probably be better solo.

Suicide Squad is a title I started off enjoying and the cliffhangers kept me buying, but a comic can only insult my intelligence so many times before I give it the boot. Sorry slutty Harley Quinn. I liked you better in the jester costume.

Teen Titans is a title I wanted to love since I grew up a fan of the older Titans teams and enjoyed the anime-style cartoon, but what a shit-pile. I kept hoping it'd get better as it got worse and worse. I quit.

One of my favorite lines from Catcher in the Rye was "Ask her if she still keeps her kings in the back row." 

Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita: "I talk in a daze, I walk in a maze, I cannot get out, said the starling."

Oscar Wilde, "Every saint has a past; every sinner has a future."

Finally, more than a line, but damn:

You know the reason The Beatles made it so big? I Wanna Hold Your Hand. First single. Fucking brilliant. Perhaps the most fucking brilliant song ever written. Because they nailed it. Thats what everyone wants. Not 24/7 hot wet sex. Not a marriage that lasts a hundred years. Not a Porsche, or a million-dollar crib. No. They wanna hold your hand. They have such a feeling that they cant hide. Every single successful song of the past fifty years can be traced back to I Wanna Hold Your Hand. And every single successful love story has those unbearable and unbearably exciting moments of hand-holding. ~ Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist by David Levithan. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Greatest Social Experiment Ever? Divide the USA along political lines. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-18 02:28:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think the greatest social experiment ever would be to divide the US into two allied-but-separate nations. 

One would be The United Conservative Republican States of America (USRSA). 

The other would be The United Liberal Democrat States of America (ULDSA). 

We'd still be cool and everything, totally best buds, but governed separately.

Let's see who's doing better in 50 years.

**UCRSA:**

* Abortion is outlawed with a possible exception for rape and incest in some of their 25 states (states' rights). 

* All or most gun laws are lifted, varying by state. 

* School prayer takes place immediately before the required pledge of allegiance, although children may opt-out. 

* The 10 Commandments can be listed in court houses, public schools, and other Christian references are allowed in generally public squares. 

* Hostility toward non-Christian faiths, and especially secularism may cause a mass exodus of non-Christians. 

* Same-sex marriage is outlawed with marriage defined in the constitution as one-man/one-woman. Some states may opt to allow for civil unions.

* Strict laws are passed to prevent illegal immigration with employers of undocumented workers fined or jailed. 

* Illegal immigrants are exported. 

* Even with 25 states, the UCRSA still outspends every other country on defense, continues war on terror. Efforts on homeland security are maintained or expanded.

* Tax breaks persist for the wealthiest Americans while social programs to benefit the poor are drastically defunded or cut altogether. Welfare is dramatically overhauled. 

* The death penalty is subject to state law, with most states requiring capital punishment for at least some offenses. 

* Drugs laws vary by state in terms of penal severity, but marijuana remains federally outlawed. 

* Free market economy is minimally-regulated with corporate tax incentives. American corporations may therefore choose to be headquartered in the UCRSA over the ULDSA.

* The energy economy emphases oil, natural gas, and coal with expanded off-shore drilling, pipelines, and fracking. Environmental regulations are relaxed.

* OSHA compliance becomes optional. OSHA-certified companies may advertise their jobs as such.

* Minimum wage varies by state and is not mandated.

 ______________________________________


**ULDSA:** 

* Abortion varies by states, but is legal to some extent everywhere. 

* Guns are heavily regulated, but some form of a firearm is legal in all 25 states, albeit with conditions. Licenses are granted for either hunting, protection, or both. In either case, gun-owners are registered with their firearms, all sales are tracked including ammunition and accessories, and licenses require criminal and mental health background checks. All gun sales and purchases must be carried out by licensed gun-retailers: no gun shows, no private sales. Guns, ammunition, magazines, and accessories are limited and regulated.

* Separation of church   state is explicit in the constitution with the ULDSA officially declared legally secular. Religions may operate freely, but fall under all normal laws and are subject to equal taxation. 

* Taxes are based proportionately on wealth with those most able to pay subject to higher taxes; those least able to pay are subject to less or no taxes. 

* Marriages between any consenting adults are recognized with all relevant benefits. 

* Equal rights are afforded to any and all Americans, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc. "Affirmative action" varies according to state laws.

* Native Americans are offered an entire state with a sincere apology and an offer to declare independence as a sovereignty or remain a territory of the ULDSA with all relevant protections and rights under assumption of recognition of applicable federate laws and mandates.

* The ULDSA largely stays out of foreign affairs and redirects previous defense funds toward education, infrastructure, social programs, a replacement program for NASA, scientific research, and single-payer "socialized" health care.

* Health care falls under government regulation with taxes and subsidies encouraging healthier lifestyle choices. 

* Death penalty abolished with the highest form of punishment being "life without possibility of parole." Greater emphasis on rehabilitation. 

* Drug offenders with no violent criminal history are released. Criminal records of drug offenses are kept for reference only.

<TEXT> Got word he shipped and a tracking number in less than 24 hours. No FE asked for. Four days later, the product is in my hand and vacuum sealed. I'll come back to review the actual product, but when it's advertised as "regular commercial" and at this price, you can't be too disappointed. DrWhite is ultra A+. Will do business again. HIGHLY recommended. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-02-03 17:15:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My pick? It may surprise you. Not Superman. Not Batman. Wonder Woman. Marvel already has a rich mythology with Thor, Hercules, etc., and related characters, and the Wonder Woman mythology would blend nicely. Besides, how many comics does Marvel have starring a solo woman?

Who would I trade to get her? Well, Wonder Woman is one of DC's "Big Three," or "Trinity," so it's going to take a sizable trade. I'd offer Daredevil, Elektra, Bullseye, Moon Knight, Power Man, Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, and The Fantastic Four. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My pick? Spider-Man. He'd be a shoe-in for The Justice League, and he brings a unique style and power-set to the DC universe. 

Who would I be willing to trade to get him? I'd like to see what Marvel could do with some 2nd stringers like Booster Gold   Blue Beetle (Kord), but they'd probably need more in exchange for a heavy-hitter like Spider-Man. Throw in Lady Godiva, Fire, Ice, Power Girl, Captain Atom, Firestorm, Red Tornado and Hawkman if that's what it takes. If that's still not enough, throw in Captain Marvel. How could they resist? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-01-16 18:40:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My picks:

Justice League: International - It was just getting good when they canceled it.

Shadow Cabinet: An old Milestone series featuring Icon, Rocket, Donner, Blitzen, Iron Butterfly, Mechanic, Payback, Starlight, Twilight, etc.

Cyborg: I think it's pretty messed up he was promoted to be a core and founding member of the Justice League and doesn't have his own book.

Black Lightning: Very cool superhero who doesn't get the exposure he deserves.

Ragman: He looks cool and there just aren't a lot of Jewish superheroes. He could even join Batman Inc. and be the sanctioned hero of Israel or something.

The Creeper: An entertaining character who, in the hands of the right writer, can be a great read.

Lobo: Yeah, this character reeks of the 90s, but he's kind of like DC's answer to Wolverine.

Hitman: One of the best comics DC has ever published.

The Atom: The on-again, off-again Leaguer has some interesting adventures.

New Gods: It's kind of a classic, and Orion and Darkseid have already made appearances.

<TEXT> It could be artists or writers, but who's someone who gets a lot of fanfare you just can't stand, and why?

Personally, for writers, I have to say Frank Miller. While I loved everything he did up until 300, everything since has been awful.

For artists, ~~Scott Lobdell~~ Kenneth Rocafort, mainly for that [stupid pentagon](http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-8.54.15-PM-500x319.png) he obsessively draws on every nose.

**EDIT**: I want to add J. Michael Straczynski to writers. In terms of Spider-Man's worst enemies, Doc Ock and Green Goblin have nothing on JMS. </TEXT>

<TITLE> If I directed Batman </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-19 02:05:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If I were fortunate enough to be given the reigns to direct my own Batman franchise, the first entire trilogy would be focused on The Joker.

 

Batman: Year One - Gotham is established as crime-ridden city. We get Bruce Wayne's origin story and the rise of two warring crime syndicates: The Zucco Family and The Falcone Family. When Bruce returns, he begins his crusade as Batman and aids Lieutenant Gordon and DA Harvey Dent in bringing down the mobs, the most prominent of which is The Falcone Crime Family, which has their dirty work done by the mysterious Red Hood.

 

Meanwhile, Bruce and Alfred attend a circus only to see two performers, The Flying Greysons, fall to their deaths with their acrobat teenage son left behind. Knowing what it's like to be orphaned, Bruce offers to take their 16-year-old son, Dick Greyson, as his ward. Batman vows to seek out the guilty party. It seems there's more to Haley's Circus than meets the eye, with ties to the Zucco mob and possibly more. Batman temporarily switches his focus to the Zucco Family, much to this dismay of Gordon, who wants the pressure to stay on The Falcones. Tony Zucco, the man responsible for the death of Greyson's parents, nearly gets the drop on Batman but is stopped by Dick, who shows up unexpectedly, having figured out Batman's identity after finding the secret entrance to the Bat Cave. Dick wants to kill Tony, but Batman stops him.

 

After some drama over getting involved, Batman leaves Dick with Alfred to discuss it later, now ready to go after the Falcones full-throttle. In the end, after a battle with Batman in a factory, Hood takes the plunge into the chemical vat. Batman thanks Gordon and the DA, leaving a gift on roof of the GCPD: The Bat Signal.

 

Batman: Year 2 - Lieutenant Gordon is now a Police Captain and facing an uphill battle surrounded by crooked cops and a Commissioner and mayor who are anti-Batman. Unfortunately, a new menace has risen in the form of the psychopathic Joker, who has gone to war with organized crime, with the remainder of The Zucco Crime Family having risen to go to war with the struggling Falcone Crime Family. The Joker has created pure chaos, creating problems for criminals, the justice system, and citizens alike. All of this is to get Batman's attention, with whom he seems to have some sort of vendetta.

 

Dick, meanwhile, is being put through intensive training as he continues to insist on involving himself in Batman's affairs. Batman is trying to physically and mentally break him to prove he's not cut out for it, but Dick is surpassing every expectation. In some respects, he's even a better student than Bruce was. Still, Batman warns about him getting involved.

 

Batman's hand is forced, however, when The Joker stages an assault on Wayne Manor as part of his war on the wealthy and powerful. Alfred is safe in the Bat Cave, but Dick is kidnapped, as The Joker is curious what Bruce Wayne would do for the boy's life. Alarms and camera footage alert Alfred, who communicates the kidnapping to Batman. Now it's personal.

 

Batman confronts The Joker, barely rescuing Dick before an explosion. When Batman orders Dick to stay put while he pursues Joker, but he doesn't listen. During an encounter, The Joker explains that Batman created him, causing Batman to feel guilt for all of The Joker's crimes. The whole ruse was a trap for Batman, getting Batman between the cross-hairs of the warring Zucco and Falcone families. While Batman deals with them, The Joker would be getting away, but he's stopped by Dick, who is crudely disguised with some scraps of green and red clothing he found in the alley. While Dick is able to handle Joker in the fight, Joker catches him off-guard with a crowbar and is violently beating him with it when Batman shows up and ends it. Batman carries Dick's beaten and bloodied body away and hands The Joker over to the authorities.

 

Joker is tried for his crimes with Dent handling prosecution, but The Joker manages to pull off an acid attack in court, splashing half of Dent's face. Joker is able to plead insanity as a plea-bargain to avoid a possible mistrial as Batman's citizen's arrest may be thrown out in court. The Joker is institutionalized at Arkham Asylum. In the end of the film, The Joker is introduced to his therapist: Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

 

Batman: Year 3 - Captain Gordon is now Commissioner Gordon and taken control of the police, and it's just in time as Two-Face has re-organized crime in Gotham and all but taken over. To make matters worse, an unknown and mysterious figure or organization mounted an attack on Blackgate Prison and Arkham Asylum, flooding Gotham's streets with criminals and maniacs, including The Joker. Dr. Harleen Quinzel believes she's the person best suited to bringing in The Joker and has a run-in with Batman that confirms what she already believed about him: he's the cause of the problems in Gotham and responsible for The Joker. When she finally finds The Joker, having returned to the now-condemned chemical factory, he lures her in and gives her a taste of what he experienced. She emerges Harley Quinn.

 

With so much chaos in the city with organized and disorganized crime, Batman finally relents and allows Dick to join him, but only as a sidekick, to hang back, to cover him, to help him out, etc. He is not to confront anyone directly. It turns out, they make an amazing team.

 

Two-Face is now struggling to control the criminal element as there's so much on the street, but he's amassing an army in the hopes of taking over Gotham completely. It's all-out war between Two-Face's empire and the Gotham police, and of course Batman, but Two-Face has a vendetta against The Joker, The Joker wants to kill Two-Face, Gordon, the police, Gotham in general, and Batman, and Batman now feels responsible for the whole lot of them.

 

The Joker retaliates against Two-Face for his repeated attempts to kill him, undermining Two-Face's plans, but in the final confrontation, neither Batman, Robin, nor Harley Quinn are able to stop Two-Face from apparently killing The Joker. Harley tries to kill Two-Face, Batman, and Robin, but is stopped in a combined effort. Batman tries to appeal to Dent, who finally turns himself in.

 

While being taken away, Dent reveals to Batman that he's been two sides of the same coin all along. He's always been the District Attorney, and it was really Dent who undermined Two-Face, not The Joker. He explains that his efforts to organize all the criminals and maniacs was so they could all collectively be put away in a set-up he devised. When he's asked to explain the Blackgate and Arkham breaks, he says that wasn't him, it was "Bane."

 

"Bane?" "He never gave me a name. He only said 'bane.' The bane of Batman, the bane of Gotham, the bane of everything. He told me this city wasn't mine, yours, or Gordon's. Gotham belongs to him." "Bane..." The last shot is Bane watching Batman through binoculars as Batman closes the doors on the ambulance Dent is in. Quietly he says, "Yes, Batman. Bane."

 

The fun part is, when you watch the movie again and look really hard, Bane can often be seen somewhere in the background, just watching.

 

Batman: Year 4 - In part 4, Batman   Robin are forced to constantly put out fires, sometimes literally. A cat-burglar is confronted and put on notice, Firefly is spreading dangerous arsons, Zsasz is a serial killer on the loose, the chemist Scarecrow has released a fear-toxic causing people to go mad, an eco-terrorist calling herself Poison Ivy is causing havoc, a man called "The Penguin" has taken over organized crime in the absence of Two-Face, a mad scientist calling himself "Freeze" has frozen half the city, and some idiot calling himself "The Riddler" is committing crimes and leaving clues. Batman   Robin are able to bring Firefly, Zsasz, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and Riddler to justice, but not without consequences. Batman has been badly burned, stabbed, psychologically scarred by fear toxin, worn down by Poison Ivy's toxins, and mentally exhausted by The Riddler. When he finally agrees to Alfred's demands that he come home and rest before dealing with Freeze or Penguin, he checks in with Robin, who is still doing recon on The Penguin and Freeze, and then he arrives home to the Batcave. Once he accesses the secret entrance to the mansion, he finds Alfred unconscious and is then attacked by Bane.

 

Bane takes a physically, mentally, and psychologically exhausted Batman and kicked the ever-living shit out of him right into the Bat Cave for an epic battle. He reveals that he (obviously) knows his secret identity and that he's been lying in wait since the beginning to take Gotham from Batman. In the final scene, he breaks Batman's back, drops him to the ground and says, "Broken and done. Gotham now belongs to Bane."

 

Batman: Year 5 - One year after the breaking of the bat, a now-20-year-old Dick Greyson has assumed the identity of Batman with one instruction from Bruce: do not confront Bane directly. The first part of the movie is the new Batman taking down the tragic villain Freeze.

 

Not only is Dick doing an amazingly good job of keeping the Batman myth alive, but a new presence has emerged in the form of what the media has dubbed "Batgirl." It appears Catwoman is at least sometimes on the side of righteousness as well, so Dick isn't entirely alone out there.

 

Bane doesn't control Gotham yet. The Penguin still controls half of Gotham, and they're warring constantly. Bane doesn't go after this new Batman right away because he seems to be focused on Penguin almost exclusively, so he believes he and Batgirl to be unconnected to the original Batman.

 

With a budding romance between Dick and Batgirl, who is Gordon's daughter, Catwoman lurks in the background, possibly jealous, and Bane hopes to use this. She's been caught stealing from him a number of times, and when he finally gets his hands on her, he lures her to his side. He wants her to work directly with the new Batman and Batgirl to take down The Penguin, which they absolutely do.

 

Catwoman turns on them, which sets them up for Bane. He says he'll take pleasure in breaking two more bats, which he may very well accomplish, but Catwoman double-crosses Bane, setting him up for his own downfall at the hands of Batman and Batgirl. Bane still manages to get the upper-hand thanks to his Venom, but that's when a Batwing flies overhead, a smoke bomb his the ground, and when the smoke clears, the real, original Batman is standing tall in a modified, armored, cybernetic- enhanced suit. Catwoman, meanwhile, gets away with much of Bane's fortune, so she played him for a fool.

 

Bane and Bruce battle it out as Dick and Barbara clear the area. Bane is enhanced by Venom, and Bruce is enhanced by his suit, so it's a pretty fair fight. In the end, Batman takes down Bane and reclaims his city. With Freeze, Penguin, and Bane out of the picture, Gotham is safe again.

 

Finally safe in her own home, Barbara enjoys some quality time with her dad. There's a knock at the door, she answers, BLAM! She's shot through the spine by The Joker.

 

Batman: Year 6 - The Joker is back. Two-Face didn't kill him after all. Yes, he was tossed into heavy machinery that apparently ground him up, but the remains turned out not to be his. The Joker takes Barbara Gordon and kidnaps Jim as well. Now it's up to Batman and Nightwing to save them both and finally stop Joker once and for all. This movie would basically be an adaptation of Alan Moore's "Killing Joke."

 

Nightwing spin-off movie follows Year 6.

<TEXT> Ah, that delightful meme is going around Facebook again: Dear god, why do you allow violence in our schools? "I'm not allowed in schools." ~ God.

1. An omnipotent being is not "allowed?" Doesn't sound too fucking powerful to me.

2. Just to clear something up, god is "allowed" in schools; god isn't allowed to be forced upon students. There's a difference between having a right to worship and having someone else's religion shoved down your throat.

3. So the argument here is that god is either too weak to be where he isn't wanted (by some), is too butthurt by the slight, or it isn't important enough for him to "break the rules" and intervene? So this meme basically shows that your god is impotent, petty, uncaring, sucks and is unworthy of worship.

Nicely done, Christians. Point well made. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Finally had a "bad" trip. Got any stories? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-18 03:10:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not terrible, but definitely not a fun night. I took entirely too much 2CE (a dab'll do ya) and the whole world just fell apart on me. The shit came on like a freight train. Before I could even react to an emergence of fractal patterns, suddenly, everything around me transformed into wild animations, and not simple shapes, either. For example, a tree in a neighboring apartment complex turned into a cluster of Chinese dragons desperately trying to untangle themselves. I actually said out loud, "How is that even possible? Where's the context?" My wife was too overwhelmed to answer.

I tried to relax and watch Fantasia, but that wasn't working out. I went out to smoke a cigarette, but the smoke trails were interacting with everything confusingly, and I mentally projected that everywhere. I ended up just going to bed, but it was dizzying because the closed-eye hallucination were a thousand time worse. I couldn't control my thoughts, and even rationalizing that I willfully took a drug and that's why this was happening became a difficult thought to hold onto. For the first time in my life, I mentally wished for a trip to end. I wanted off the ride.

I'm not at all mad, though. I'm 31 and started getting into psychedelics with LSD when I was 18. I've had plenty of fun with LSD and shrooms, and this was my third time with 2CE. I thought I was immune to the fabled "bad trip" and had far too positive an opinion of tripping to be subject to such a thing, but I learned a valuable lesson: I'm not invincible, there is such a thing as "too much," and moderation can be a beautiful thing.

Now I'm curious. What's the worst trip you've ever had, what drug was it, and was it because you took too much, or the conditions were all wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full disclosure: I'm putting the finishing touches on my final, which is a paper on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*. I've read it, I've watched two film adaptations, I've got additional sources, but are there any Shakespeare scholars or experts here (or just fans) who have special insights they'd like to share? 

I'm not looking for someone to write my paper for me. I'm looking for new ways of looking at things, different interpretations, historical contexts I may have overlooked, hidden meanings, etc. I'm sure my professor has read hundreds of papers on Shakespeare, and I'd like to give him something he's never read before. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is America so anti-socialism? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-13 02:44:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> FDR and Johnson were two of the more socialist presidents our nation has ever had, both bringing about sweeping reform and program implementation, some of which is still in place today, from FDR's social security to Johnson's Medicare   Medicaid. Yet, knowing from history the fantastic improvements that were made via implementation of such programs and economic booms experienced under such leadership, why do you suppose socialism has long been a dirty word in this country? It seems many of the same people who would slam big government and demand reductions would never want to part with social security, Medicare and Medicaid.

Is it, perhaps, cultural? Is it historical? Are we a product of the uprising that brought about our Independence, as such that we are the freed rebels in constant fear or oppression and tyranny? Is it just the Spirit of '76 that lives on in us? Is it remnants of the Red Scare, The Cold War and McCarthyism? </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the beginning of the play, Richard breaks the fourth wall and invites the audience to live vicariously through him, but after the first few scenes, he just... stops.

It seems odd to start that way and not follow-through. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reddit, what's your perfect sandwich? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-05 22:40:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I used to just slap ham and American cheese on bread with some mustard and call that a sandwich. I was wrong. 

My sandwich:

1. Warm a pan with butter in it so the butter melts while you're building the sandwich. 

2. Once the butter melts, add two strips of bacon.

3. Take two slices of stone-ground 100% whole wheat bread.

4. On one slice, add Southwest spicy mustard. 

5. On the other slice, add mayonnaise.

6. Add a slice of jalapeo jack cheese to each slice of bread. If you want a spicier experience, Cabbot makes a habanero jack cheese.

7. Choose a slice and add one slice of fresh tomato, off the vine, never having been refrigerated. 

8. Alternately layer deli sliced ham and turkey at a deli slice thickness of 1 until you have a stack proportionate to your appetite. 

9. Add deli pickles. Two or three should be fine.

10. Top it all off with one crunchy and crisp slice of iceberg lettuce.

11. Close the sandwich and press down on it hard to keep everything squished together tight. 

12. Remove the bacon when it's finished cooking. And set it aside on a paper towel. In the time it takes to build the sandwich, the bacon should be done.

13. Throw that bad boy sandwich into the pan with the bacon grease and butter and fry it up. After about a minute, skillfully use both hands and two spatulas to flip it over to cook the other side. While trying, try adding a bit of Goya Adobo. It doesn't take much.

14. Remove the sandwich and add the bacon.

15. Eat sandwich.

16. Orgasm. 

PS: I want to try your sandwiches. If you try mine, let me know what you think. I will gladly let you know if yours is better than mine ;-) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Racially-charged question: do Mexican-American children bully white students, especially blonds? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-25 21:56:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, let's get the disclaimer out of the way: I am **NOT** a racist. At all. I recently moved to San Antonio from New Hampshire to be closer to my family, which, by the way, includes quite a few Mexican-Americans. 

I have a 3-year-old daughter who is white with gray eyes and blond hair. Recently, my wife told me coworkers of hers, including Mexican-American women, warned her after meeting our daughter that blond-haired/blue-eyed white girls get picked on by the girls of Mexican descent. 

Is this true? If so, why is it true? My wife didn't want to push the issue with her coworkers at the risk of offending them, but I'm worried for my daughter, who will be entering into pre-K next year. I doubt it's a problem with 4-year-olds, but I don't want her to grow up being bullied, either.

I have no problem with Mexican-Americans or Mexicans in general. In fact, one of the things I love about San Antonio is the Mexican culture, art, and food. 

Another thing that I've noticed is my daughter, being very outgoing and friendly, tends to walk onto playgrounds waving, smiling, and shouting things like, "Hi, friends! My name is _______! Want to play?" and the looks she gets from some of the kids are like... I don't know... mean. Like, "Who is the kid? Why is she saying hi to me? Why is she calling me a friend?" This got her instant playmates in NH. Here, it gets her dirty looks. Cultural thing? Again, this is the Latino/Latina children. The white, black, and Asian kids have been pretty warm to her.

Sorry if this is a TL;DR, but I don't know how to shorten it and I'm very curious.

**EDIT**: I'd be especially interested in hearing from Mexicans, especially those who grew up in San Antonio.

For those downvoting, I don't get you. This is an honest question out of concern for my daughter. It's not an attack on anybody. </TEXT>

<TITLE> We're always told Hamlet's famous "To be or not to be" was a soliloquy. It wasn't. </TITLE>

<TEXT> A Monologue is a speech that is spoken to someone else, or at least another character on the stage hears it.

A Soliloquy, is a speech spoken to nobody, and only the audience hears it, not any other character in the play. 

So which is this? 

When Shakespeare writes dialog, they say what they mean. If hes talking about Love, hes in love. If hes talking about killing someone, hes angry and really wants to kill them. It is, for the most part, difficult to lie in Shakespearean speech, without a stage direction saying, He or She is lying. There are exceptions, but they just have to be supported by the text. The things other people say, or what that character says before or after the incident in question. In other words, they do say what they mean, unless there is evidence to support otherwise.

What is it even saying anyway?

To be, or not to be... 

Be as in existing. To exist or not to exist, to live or not to live. Okay, hes openly questioning if he should live or die. So, this speech is about whether or not Hamlet should kill himself, which isnt totally out of the blue; at the beginning of the play, the first time Hamlet is onstage alone, he contemplates it there as well.

Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

And, by opposing, end them.

Which is better? Just take my wealth and position, keeping my mouth shut, but be racked with guilt over it, or to actually stand up for what I believe in, even though it would destroy and kill me and my family?

To die, to sleep-

No more, and by a sleep to say we end

The heartache and the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to  tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wished.

But if Im dead, no more pain, no more suffering, no more guilt, and all the problems I have now just go away. Hey, that sounds pretty good...

To die, to sleep.

To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, theres the rub,

For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

When we have shuffled off this mortal coil

Must give us pause. Theres the respect

That makes calamnity of so long life...

And if its all just a long sleep, whats on that other side? Its supposed to be so wonderful; thats why we endure all the crap in this world.

It goes on, but we can see its basically a suicide note of sorts, or at least a contemplation on the part of Hamlet.

Just before Hamlet comes on stage to give this speech, Claudius and Polonius, the murderous King and his Crony are talking with Ophelia, Polonius daughter, and Queen Gertrude. The Queen leaves... okay, now 3 on the stage. Polonius
then says:

Ophelia, walk you here.  Gracious, so please you,

We will bestow ourselves.

Hes telling Ophelia, Hamlets Girlfriend, to hang out here. But we will bestow ourselves.? 

The archaic meaning of bestow is to stow, deposit, store. So... lets store ourselves? Lets stow ourselves? Yes! Theyre saying, Lets go hide, which they then do. They exit, and Hamlet enters, talking all morbid.

But Ophelia is still on-stage. There is no Ophelia exits, nor is there Ophelia re-enters, so shes there the whole time while Hamlet talks about killing himself.

So, is the speech an aside that no one else hears? No, because at least one other person hears it, if not three. Hamlet finishes, then sees Ophelia, they have a big argument, and he gets crazy with the nunnery bit.

Exit Hamlet; enter back in Claudius and Polonius, talking about how mad Hamlet seemed because they absolutely heard him and Hamlet knew this. Then Polonius says:

How now, Ophelia?

You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;

We heard it all.

So, they did hear it! 

In most all the previous scenes, and the ones after, Hamlet is very active; hes planning, plotting, getting things ready; hes already made some written contributions for the Theatre troupe thats preparing to perform for the Royal Court. Hes been pushing his plans forward to trap the King and give the final proof he needs to show that the King did in fact kill his father. Since seeing the ghost of his dead dad, hes been consumed by this desire for justice and revenge. Suddenly, for this 1 scene, he does a complete 180 degrees and finds it a good idea to kill himself? Yes, he contemplated it in the beginning, but keep in mind, that was BEFORE he found out his father was murdered. He didn't have any motivations as he does now. At that time, it was thought to be natural causes and the will of God, and hence, theres no one to get mad at, because no one did anything wrong. When the issue of murder comes up, that changes everything and revenge becomes his motive.

Suicide is a non-solution. Its a passive thing to do compared to the rest of the events going on. Its the easy way out, and Hamlet has been setting up these plots and plays with Machiavellian precision, which is definitely not the easy way to do anything. One could claim this speech shows another side to the character of Hamlet, but would that do anything to move the story forward? On its own, it doesnt. The full text of this play can run upwards of 4 hours long. How many people will sit for a 4 hour movie when it has parts that go nowhere? Is this speech Shakespeares way of saying, Heres a bathroom break?

NO! It is NOT a soliloquy! Ophelia was on-stage. Claudius and Polonius are hiding, and listening in, and Hamlet knows it! That means his whole suicide speech is by design. Hes already spent a few scenes convincing people that hes gone mad, and there IS method in it. The King and crony are trying to figure out if its true. Now, hes actively deceiving them, so that would make this speech something that moves the plot forward. Its just another part of Hamlets master
plan, and so far, theyre falling right into it.

More evidence: The last time we saw Hamlet on stage, he meets The Players, and asks the head player to give a short, impromptu performance, who readily obliges him. Then, everyone else ends up leaving the stage, leaving Hamlet, alone, for real this time. Here he has a real soliloquy (he even mentions hes all alone) whereupon he marvels at the performance that head player just gave. In fact, he realizes, and is very much ashamed at the fact, that the actor has just
shown more intensity and commitment in his task of that brief performance than Hamlet has in HIS task of avenging his fathers murder. Hamlet has just mentally smacked himself, reminding him to start raising the stakes, or hes going to fail at his task, and also realized the importance of acting as a role in his deceptions.

So I'm supposed to believe that suddenly, the very next words he speaks on stage are implying the direct opposite? That he wants to kill himself? A soliloquy of his innermost thoughts that says he needs to step it up followed by another saying the complete opposite? 

Even MORE evidence: Shakespeares original source for Hamlet. This is NOT an original play by Shakespeare. It had been done previously by other playwrights and writers. The original source is called Historia Danica by Saxo Grammaticus. It chronicles the story of Prince Amlothi, also referred to as Amlethus. Pull off the u-s at the end, move the "H" to the front, and you have "Hamlet." The plot matches the play exactly. The father of Amlethus is murdered by his brother who then marries Amlethus mother, the Prince seeks revenge. A large part of his plan has to do with feigning madness. Two attempts are made to prove hes actually sane, one of which is to tempt him into lechery, the thinking being that any man who lusts for women cannot truly be insane. His uncle arranges for a woman to casually run into Amlethus in the forest to seduce him while they watch, which is the prototype scene for this Hamlet/Ophelia scene. But Amlethus is warned of the trap ahead of time, so he makes his own arrangements to whisk her off to a hidden place away from the eyes of the Kings agents, who gets her to tell him everything. He also has sex with her, because why wouldn't he? But in the view of the Kings agents, he continues his act of being batshit insane.

"To Be or Not To Be" is not a soliloquy; it is a monologue! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just did a clean install of Maya (Mint 13 w/Cinnamon). My PS3 Eye, which I had been using as a webcam/microphone for Skype purposes, was plugged in when I booted up the first time, and the camera was detected and works perfectly. The problem is, the microphone doesn't pick up. Can't Skype without a microphone. Any ideas?

**UPDATE**: I found [this forum](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1785840) which had the following advice which worked for someone:

<TEXT> I don't need a monitor, drives, keyboard, mouse, or a big hard drive. All I want to do with it is hook it up to my HDTV (so it'll need HD video output) and surround sound system (so it'll need optical audio output), and it'll be online. I'll only be using it to download and watch movies.

I have a cheap Dell refurbish with a single 3GHz processor and 4GB of RAM and it's just not delivering seamless HD. I end up with skipping, stuttering, audio synching, and other issues. I use VLC, DIVX, and, when all else fails, WMP. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-01-23 21:51:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's a pro-Christian story for you. I drained our bank account today to do laundry and go grocery shopping. I was thirty-something dollars short at the register and the nice, old, Christian couple behind me said that Jesus implores them to help me and my daughter. I thanked them about a hundred times and all they said was "bless you" in return. Some of my faith in humanity has been restored :-)

I'm an atheist and I have been most of my life, and believe me, I know all about the evils of religion and the harm it's caused throughout history and today, but we have to be willing to give credit where credit is due. 

Yes, I know it would've been better if they'd done it out of their own personal goodness instead of what Jesus would have them do, but regardless, it was a nice thing to do, and I am grateful.

TL;DR - Christian couple pays the balance for my groceries and I, as an atheist, am delighted. </TEXT>

Dear Christopher,

 

Knowing your concern regarding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on my position regarding this legislation.  I have appreciated having the benefit of your thoughts on this important issue.

 

H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act was introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) on October 26, 2011.  It has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee. The primary purpose of SOPA is to stop the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites. 

 

Although well intentioned, many have raised legitimate concerns regarding the legislation and believe the manner in which SOPA attempts to achieve its goals of stopping the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites is unworkable and includes many unintended and dangerous consequences. I am writing today to inform you that I have severe reservations with the legislation in its current form.

One of the main issues regarding SOPA, is it would force Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block access to websites that have been accused of facilitating copyright infringement.  Blocking access will likely slow down internet connectivity, while eroding the necessary trust the system needs. It would also set a dangerous precedent of allowing our government  and others  to filter domains. Fortunately, all sides have signaled this provision should be dropped.

Furthermore, the legislation would place a tremendous legal burden on websites accused of third-party copyright infringement and would cause them to be removed from search engines.  Even if they made an honest mistake, they would be faced with litigation from the U.S. Attorney General. Fighting the accusations would cost an enormous amount of time and money, and smaller sites would likely go out of business. Private lawsuits could also be brought against the websites. This would open up the potential for massive lawsuit abuse  even though the vast majority of online piracy occurs through a small number of websites.

While the federal government does have a role in protecting intellectual property rights, it should do so in a way that does not weaken internet security, disrupt growth, or restrict free speech and your First Amendment rights. 

As the debate on this legislation continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure the needs of copyright protection are balanced with the First Amendment Rights of all Americans. Currently H.R. 3261 remains in the House Judiciary Committee. While I do not serve on this committee, rest assured I will keep your concerns in mind should this legislation, or a similar bill ever come to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote.  

 

It is an honor to represent you in Congress.  Your suggestions are always welcome.  Please feel free to contact either my Washington office at (202) 225-5456 or the district office, (603) 641-9536.

<TEXT> My email to Representative Peter G. Palumbo: 

You called a teenage girl an "evil little thing" because she's an atheist and got religion out of a public school where it doesn't belong? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Actually, you ought to be dragged out of office. You know what I consider evil? A full grown adult male in a position of power publicly shaming a child who bravely challenged the system and won. You are a coward.
