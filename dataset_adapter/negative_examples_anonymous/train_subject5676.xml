<TEXT> Safety First


They call me the rubber and sawdust man.  
Traveling place to place doing whatever it is I can:  
fencing off bodies of water,  
packing street holes with sand,  
spend weeks of summer concreting uneven land.   




I have fought them all,   
every last one:  
houses with asbestos walls,   
schools that let kids burn in the sun,  
dogs waiting to maul,   
a cell phone in each pocket to report hit and runs  
Safety is my call.  
From peanuts to guns.  


That day and all days after,  
I have vowed to protect the children of the earth.  
All children, all races, always,  
from neighbourhood watch to restricted flag surf.  
I have tried to make this world safe,  
devoted life, to protect life's worth.  
On the day of my first date with a beautiful nurse,   
who worked in proofing birth,  




I blunted the edges of my shoes,   
avoided the kiss because of bacteria.  
I now had an ally, though we were set to lose,   
never to remove fat from cafeterias.  
Together we battled those adventure cruises,   
fought the thumbtack hysteria,  
voted for the ban of stiletto shoes,   
at the airport handed out pamphlets regarding malaria.  




Together we fought the danger,  
and love did grow.  
When we intervened with drug takers,   
she confessed her heart a seed to sow.  
At an adult swim class, I told her I loved her.  
 She replied "I know."  
We went to a secular, indoor wedding planner.  
Picked spring to avoid heat and snow.  




In a beautiful, bubble wrapped dress,  
she walked down the aisle.  
I opted for a life jacket with a double breast,   
over suit and tie.  
The flower girl, flowerless, deciding to avoid that mess,   
just held the tail, as we were blessed.  
And walked down that one third,  
 a half, a quarter mile.  



Three days after our wedding communion,  
she died in her sleep.  
There was no preparation.   
Just an aneurysm.  
Just a canyon of spontaneous grief.

Or I guess you could just preface the preface the piece with an explanation. I think the piece could be more humorous and effective in other, less form heavy writing styles. Overall I think you did well! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think 14 is a good age to read that book. Its around those years which you begin to consider the depths of morality. I found the book enthralling and I still enjoy it. Though I read The Great Gatsby  at 18, and all though I found it to be well written, the themes and messages were things I had already considered through other media. Of course this shows the impact of the novel on society, I'm just saying that some of those novels written in a different time or place are more significant at younger ages.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love reading! It has always played a massive part in my life. I've been writing a lot since around the age of 15. I am now 18 and I'm editing my first novel.  A good friend of mine is editing helping me and she is overwhelmingly positive. though when I read my work, I find it hard to not compare it to the books that I love, which are always significantly better. I"m wondering if others feel this way about there writing? And if so, how do you approach these feelings?

<TEXT> I would say don't give up on the idea of survivors if that is what you want, it may seem that there is no way but perhaps there is  a way which will think up while you're in the shower one day. Its always ok to rewrite the ending. Also I think a less depressing kill everyone off would be something whereby everyone devoted their resources to the survival of a specific individual or everyone collectively just sits down in one another's arms and accepts their fate.  </TEXT>
