And if they had been occupied, I sincerely doubt that it would have meant global domination for the Nazis. The U.S. was not even in the picture at that point, FDR and the Russians likely would have routed the Nazis even without the help of England. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the soldiers I serve with is originay from Sri Lanka and will not stop bragging about the country. This has really made me want to see the place for myself, but I do not hear about a lot of Sri Lanka tourism. 


**Length** Around a week. 


I love exploring Buddhist sacred places, and love seeing places that are out of the typical tourist paths. I have heard quite a bit about Sri Lanka's tea and spice production, this would be interesting to learn about first hand. I love food and am a lretty adventurous traveller.



Can anyone speak from experience about travelling to Sri Lanka? Any recommendations or warnings? What about websites, books, or articles about Sri Lanka that would be useful for my travel research.?

<TEXT> I do not think English as a major was a mistake. College was a mistake. I have tons of debt, no job, and I am only now getting trained in a trade that can actually profit me. Many college grads are unemployed, while certified and unionized allied trade workers have phenomenal jobs. College is not for everyone, and do not let anyone tell you that you need to go to college to be successful. You need to have skills to be successful. There are other ways to procure those skills than college. Trade school, apprenticeship, the military etc can all make you *way* more successful than college and are way cheaper..

<TITLE> CMV: I do not believe in a progressive tax system. Change my view. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-21 20:17:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I believe in a flat tax system, where everyone pays the same percentage of their earnings in income tax. I do not believe in a progressive tax system where richer people pay a higher percentage than poor people. I am a working class democrat, but I do not see a progressive system stimulating economic growth. It seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class.. On the other hand, I believe a flat tax based would be fairer. Rich people would pay more (because 15% of a million is higher than 15% of 35'000) but would still be encouraged to leave their capital in the US economy instead of finding ways around the tax code... Can someone make a solid case for a progressive tax system directed at a working class guy like me?

<TEXT> Even in my dreams you blind me.

Not the kind of blind that takes away sight;

But the kind of blind that, taken breathless by a sight 

Attracts attention to that great sight in such a way 

That nothing else can be seen

For your colors are the only true colors.

Your contrast stands out against the blackness 

Like a veritable sunshine of bright eyes

And waves of hair that compete with the ocean in grace. 

I stumble around unsatisfied

For in having seen a sight so blinding

My vision remains imprinted with you.

Now, neither in this world or the one made of dreams

Could I ever have an unclouded view.

For you pump through my veins 

And leak from my pores

And my vision is blinded by you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You obviously have no clue what Capitalism is. None of those nations have free and unregulated economies. They are mixed economies. 


Workers own the means of production in those nations through cooperatives, and are backed up by very strict economic regulation from the state. None of those nations have government planned economies because as I have been saying all along *not all forms of socialism advocate state run economies*. Communism advocates state control, many socialists do not advocate for state control of the markets. Hell, Anarcho-Syndicalists and Libertarian Socialists are against the existence of **any state at all**.




For the record, I am neither a Socialist, or a Communist, I am a Laissez Faire Capitalists Libertarian. I just don't wrongly represent people I disagree with. </TEXT>

Sanders advocates Democratic Socialism, as found in Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and other European nations. Contrast the living examples of these Socialist nations to China (and more extremely North Korea) and you can see in living color the difference between Democratic Socialism and Communism.

It is more than a label, it is a perspective he actively embraces and one I reject. If he really is the socialist he says he is, I worry about his end state goals because I do not support the economic end state goals of socialism or social democratism in the slightest.

<TEXT> I used to be a moderate republican with some libertarian leanings. I have just gotten to the point where they have totally ran away from me. I have voted Democrat in the past, and am thinking about becoming a registered Democrat. I thought I would ask for advice finding a place in this party.



I support civil liberties totally. I support drug decriminalization, marajuana legalization, and marriage equality. I support drastic immigration  reform. I consider myself a Square Deal Democrat. I advocate for total transparency  in government, demilitarization of police forces, prison reform, and an end to mandatory minimum sentencing. 



On the other hand, there are a few issues I worry would put me at odds with the Democratic party. I do not support gun control. I generally prefer the state to stay out of the markets (though I am a not a rabid welfare hater or anything). 


What do you say? Am I at odds with the party? Are there any factions/caucuses or anything that I might be able to connect with? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am 22, Afghanistan vet, and active VFW member. I love the VFW. They are one of the oldest VSOs around, and do tons for vets. Many young guys have an image of the VFW/Legion as a smoky, shitty bar full of drunk old farts. While some VFWs are like this, blanketing the whole organization as such is totally off base. Let me make some points.


1. Joining a VSO is about what you can give to the organization not what you get out of it. Many vets our age (and millenials in general) act pretty entitled. There has been an influx of new veterans organizations all about giving shit to vets, meanwhile these old vets and old VSOs are operating on a totally different premise. If you aren't looking for free shit or a pat on the back, but are looking to give back and continue your life of service, the VFW is a great place to be. The VFW offers many ways to get involved, showing up en masse to lonely vets funerals who die in nursing homes, getting involved with local organizations like habitat for humanity, getting involved with local politics to fight for vets, scholarship funds for vets kids, and even a home for orphans of war. 


2. Many guys discount these old VSOs because of the large number of Korea/Vietnam/old crusty vets. Doing so overlooks a huge resource. These guys have been there, done that, and seen most of the issues we are now facing. They make phenomenal (and willing) mentors. Sometimes the reason VFW bars are full of crusty old vets is because they have nowhere else to go where folks understand them. 

3. I have been very enriched by my experience with the VFW. The old guys in my post have given me solid (and sometimes blunt) advice, I have been able to continue civic service by volunteering with habitat for humanity and attending old vets funerals when they have nobody else. If your local post isn't perfect, none of us are so give them a break, join and make a difference.

There is a middle ground. Women do not want a controlling jerk, but they don't want a pushover pussy either. Make decisions. If you are going to take her out somewhere, think ahead and choose something, make a tentative plan. Don't just make decisions to make decisions, but use what you know she likes, and other info to make an informed decision. At the same time, you need to listen to her opinions, take them to heart, and add those to your internal database for future decisions. She does not want to be shut out of the decision making process, she just wants you to take initiative and action. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jefferson thought that the American Revolution was a spark that would ignite liberty around the world. He advocated a worldwide awakening to "the spirit of `76". This belief coupled with his natural francophilia explain his ardent (sometimes radical) support for the French Revolution even after it turned chaotic. Other founders were not so enthusiastic. France went a different direction than the US, excluding moderate voices like Lafayette in favor of truly radical revolutionaries. 

All in all, I think the colonies proved that liberty could win, and that big empires could be defeated and in so doing acted as a touchstone for the French (who consequently used much of Jefferson's advice in their early Assembly of Notables) but ultimately each event had their own causes and sparking moments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am from a trailer park in South Alabama. I love the close knit community of my trailer park. I love how nobody puts on airs, everyone is truly free to be themselves. Attractive folks (trailer park girls are **sexy**) to unattractive folks, everyone gets along just fine. We have mechanics, retirees, a hooker, and a charter fishermen (among other trades). We are diverse ethnically, we listen to different types of music, we have different religions but we all get along. In my trailer park everyone is poor, but not ashamed of our poverty. So we don't make much, we get by through brow sweat and elbow grease. 



I think my trailer park is the paradise many folks are looking for, but they are too busy looking down their nose at us to see it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think AR 670-1 defines the IPFU's unserviceability.

 
DA Pam 710-2-2, Supply Support Activity Supply System: Manual Procedures, 30 Sep 98, Glossary, pp. 268-276 defines unservicability as **More inclusive term than damage or destruction. It indicates, in military usage, that the article to which the term is applied is no longer useful for the intended purpose. Damage or destruction may not be involved. The term also indicates property that has deteriorated through use; however, it may include property no longer usable for its original purpose, despite the reason for its condition.**



Technically your pt's aren't unservicable, since they serve their original purpose but they are unpresentable (presentability can be determined by your CO). Unless your NCO argues that the reflective Army logo was a safety thing, in which case rubbing it off would make the shorts unservicable since they don't perform the original purpose.




Bottom line, your NCO/SNCO is gonna fucking win this war. Buy new PT's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drunk guy is at a bar pounding drinks and he notices a well dressed young man at the other end of the bar. Every time a female walks by the young man he whispers something in their ear, sometimes they look at him shocked until he says something to soothe them, but the drunk notices that several times the women accompany the young man to a private room in the back of the tavern. The drunk has observed the young man score several times today. Thd drunk thinks to himself, "what line is this man using to get all these girls? It has a pretty high success rate." and stumbles across the room and asks the young man "Shayy, what line are you ushing to get all theshe pretty women". The young man politely explains "whenever a pretty woman walks near me I whisper in her ear, 'Tickle your ass with a feather?' If she agrees, we go to the back and get kinky, on the other hand if she is offended I repeat myself 'typical nasty weather' and she thinks she just misheard me."


The drunk agrees that this is a fine line, and decides to try it before he forgets it. He stumbles out of the bar, summons a cab to drive him home, stumbles into his house where his wife is resting on the couch and propositions her "Shayy honey, can I shtick a feather in your ass?" She looks at him and replies "What did you say you drunk sonofabitch?" To which he replies "Fucking rain".

<TEXT> People spend a lot of time arguing about just and unjust wars. The way I see it, if you are murdering women, children, and noncombatants or committing war crimes you are fighting an unjust war. 


If you are fighting bad guys (The Taliban, Al-Qaida, ISIS, fill-in-the-blank) it may not always be a *wise* war, but that does not mean there is no justice in it. 



Its up to the politicians to decide whether we go to war, it is up to the soldiers to fight those wars honorably. We voice our opinions about the wisdom of proposed wars through the ballot box as private citizens, we actively influence the way in which our nation wages war by behaving honorably in our AO's whenever we are sent to war.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of what we think is funny hinges on the element surprise. Jokes are all about tricking your brain by ending the story different than you expect (aka delivering the punchline).


What we percieve as cleverness is someone else stimulating our brains by inserting a common reference/relatable shared knowledge in a surprising way (for example when they make a pop culture reference at a time we did not expect a pop culture reference).


It all boils down to brain stimulation through surprise. Of course it is more complex than this,  but that is the eli5 answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do support the existence of unions. I said that in my first post. I am all for folks *voluntarily* joining together to bargain for healthcare or anything else. I just do not support using the state to achieve those goals. I also stated I would not join a union because as of yet there are none who want to further my goals.


I oppose abortion because I believe it to be a violation of the nonaggression principle, and therefore the lawful domain of state intervention. I believe the state should punish/prevent acts of aggression, since I believe a fetus to be a human entitled to full human rights, extinguishing their life is an act of aggression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My goals are

1. Deregulation of the markets. Unions advocate for *more* market regulation. I do not support welfare, federal organizations like OSHA, or any other federal market legislation.

2. Total freedom of association. If a business owner does not want to serve or hire someone based on race, religion, or bias, he has that right. Although it is apalling, I believe each individual owns the products of their labor, and can refuse to give those products to anyone for any reason.

3. Many unions support abortion coverage in an employment contract. I do not believe abortions are moral and therefore oppose this.

4. I oppose the state forcing employers to provide healthcare for their employees. While it is moral, and good business practice, the details of an employment contract are for the employee and employer to decide through bargaining the state has no place in the matter.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unions are fine, but should remain voluntary. Individuals must be free to join and leave a union at will. Forced unionization is an infrigement on the right of voluntary association. There should be no penalty for refusal to join a union. 


I would not join a union because there are none whose goals match my own, but if others want to join one it does not bother me.


One important distinction. Progressives and Liberals (in the modern sense) tendto view the world collectively. We view the world through an individualists perspective. My class, race, and cuture do not represent me and I do not represent them. I am my own person, distinct from my class, race, and cultural heritage.  </TEXT>

My end goal would be total legalization. Your body is your own and you alone get to choose what substances your body uses. Realistically I would like to see significant reduction in drug penalties, lower sentences, turn drug crimes into misdemeanors. I would like to cut all funding to national agencies' operations against drugs, especially the DEA.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. MEPs is basically just a very long set of examinations, physical, mental, bloodwork, xrays, etc. Once deemed fit it is also where you sign your contract. Basic is tough but simple. It is stressful, drill sergeants will scream at you and get in your face, but as long as you follow basic i structions you will be fine.

2. The cutoff age is 42 for enlistment.

3. Being in the Reserves or National Guard means you go to drill one weekend a month, and two weeks out of the year. Sometimes they deploy and you get active duty pay. Active duty soldiers are on cal 24/7, usually work Mon thru Fri depending on your job.

4. goarmy.com has a list of all possible jobs. Not all of these will be available though. Depending on your ASVAB score and the dates school seats are open.

5. n/a

6. They don't *have* to move with you. If you want to live away from them. You typically stay at one duty station between 3-5 years at a time. As long as you are in the Army you have to move where they tell you to when they tell you to. They will pay for your family to come along and provide accomodations, but if you choose to leave your family behind it is your choice.

7. Yes. When a leader tells you to respond, you respond. No matter how minute or pointless the thing they tell you to do is, you will do it because they own your ass. If you have a temper and a tendency to snap off/talk back to authorith, the drill sergeants in basic willl resolve that issue quickly.



The Army is not for everyone. If you are just looking for benefits, you will be disappointed. There is piles and piles of BS that falls on you the minute you join. At the same time it is rewardinf, enabling, and something you will never forget. </TEXT>

They are kids. Kids act like kids. Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Hypernationalism usually comes from folks who don't have a clue what real sacrifice is all about.

<TEXT> No, I have not deified anything. The Word is not a divine entity, but is the true Word of the only God. It should be worshipped as the one true revelation of God.



The Holy Spirit has many roles. He reveals the scriptures to those whom he will, he works upon the hearts of men to prepare them to recieve the Word, he impressed the Word upon the hearts/minds of the writers of the Holy Scriptures, etc.


Are you asking if the Holy Spirit can reveal God outside of Scriptures? If so, yes he *can*, it is physically possible, but he does not. God has ordained that his word would be the final and closed revelation of himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We had/have no endgame. They just want to drag this war out until it no longer makes politicians money. That is my opinion. Just like Vietnam and Korea. No endgame, no good planning, just something that made the politicians look good at the time.


We should have gone in there with the sole purpose of retaliation for their attacks. Shock and awe, obliterate them and their hold, then leave. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at Forward Operating Base Shank in Eastern Afghanistan.


I think originally the war in Afghanistan was justified, but politicians put their stupid heads into it. It does not take 13 years to win a war. We should have been done a long time ago, it is not our job to build a nation. Iraq was never justified. Saddam was a bad guy, but ISIS is a helluva lot worse. I don't trust politicians, and I don't think they have our best interests in mind. They don't give a shit how many young kids die overseas as long as they can make it look like they died for something. Since Korea we have been doing the same shit, and young American kids have been paying for the politicians records.



That being said, i fought and lived for my brothers. We were not fighting good or decent people, they deserved every bit of firepower we used against them. I don't regret it, I would do it again. I just wish people cared still. I wish folks cared about the guys who died. I wish people would learn that war is costly and should always be a last resort. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tattoos are a strong part of the military tradition. I agree with that. Most military folks (including myself) have several tattoos. That being said, there have to be standards. The Army has no problem if you have tattoos, they just have to follow certain guidelines. The Army will change as the culture changes though. 



No, our recruit pool will not grow slim. We are kicking good soldiers out as it is to meet force realignment. For every kid who doesn't meet the minimum enlistment requirements, there are a dozen other who do meet the standards.

I am a soldier. Been all over the world, saw a lot of shit, grew up a lot really quick, I am responsible for millions of dollars and the lives of my friends every day. I can retire at 39 and get a pension and healthcare, with plenty of time (and a phenomenal resume) to embark on another career. Oh, and sometimes I get to blow shit up and drive big trucks. And I can say the work fuck in every sentence without getting in trouble with my boss. I fuckin' love my job.


Advice for folks who wanna come into my career field;

1. Don't smoke weed.

2. Don't get in trouble with the law.

3. Don't be a lazy fuck.

That pretty much covers all the bases. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need some advice guys. I was driving my 2014 Corolla last night, and it was very dark as I prepared to pull onto the interstate ramp. There was a very deep pothole which I hit at about 35-40 mph and blew my right front tire out. When I removed the tire to replace it with my spare i noticed that the control arm appeared to be bent. On the drive home there were no real issues other than the car pulling noticably to the right. The rim appears to be undented on the old tire.


Can someone give me some advice before I get tge mechanics to look at it on monday? I am taking it to a dealership mechanic because I do not want to fuck up my warranty. What kinda wallet damage am I looking at? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on which branch, and whether you are an Officer, Enlisted, or Warrant officer.

I can only speak to the Army's way of doing things because I am in the Army.

**Enlisted** 

E-1 to E-4 is automatic, based on time in service. If you don't fuck up (get a dui, drugs, punctual etc) you will get promoted.

E-5 to E-6 is points based. Each MOS (job) in the Army has a certain amount of points one needs to make E-5 or E-6. A soldier has to go to a promotion board, meet certain standards (attend NCO school, certain self development classes), and have the correct number of points (points are awarded for various things, awards, PT, how well you fire a weapon, civilian education etc.)

E-7 and above is board selected. Each MOS has a specific amount of allotted slots for each of these ranks. A board meets every year and looks over all the E-6's and aboves qualifications and determines whether to promote them to one of those slots.

**Officer**

O-1 to O-2 is a pretty much automatic promotion, based on time in service.

O-3 and above is based on board selection, similar to E-7 and above on the enlisted side.

**Warrant**

WO-1 to WO-2 is pretty much automatic based on time in grade/service. The rest are determined by board selection.

**Two closing thoughts**

1. You still have many chances in peacetime to win awards. Catching attention for hard work during a field exercice, winning Soldier/NCO of the month boards, all kinds of things.

2. We (the U.S.) are not at peace and probably never will be in our lifetime. There is always somewhere to deploy to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just keep it up man. Running is all about practice. I am in the Army and we run all the damn time, so I have had lots of practice. But don't overdo it. Here is my personal running schedule for speed improvement.


**Mon**- 2-4 miles at a pace that hurts. (the 7 min mile for me right now)


**Wed**- Sprintd, 61-20's, suicides, and other sprint excercises for 45 mins. Followed by lengthy streching.


**Fri**- Run for 45 mins at a pace you can carry on a conversation in. This is all about building lung capacity, learning to pace yourself well, and correct your form. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He never said he was suffering from depression. He said he fell into a pit of depression early on in his academic career.


For many folks the military would not be good if they suffered from real depression. If you are easily emotionally affected by the world around you, the military sure as hell is not for you.

Others suffer depression stemming from low self esteem and feelings of low worth. The military instills you with a high level of self confidence and puts you in places of high responsibility. Accomplishing your job well only increases your worth and self confidence. This could be just the challenge they need.


The military is not for everyone. It is a rough, stressful, mucky life that not everyone can handle.  </TEXT>

Just because you can graduate college does not mean you are smart. I am responsible for millions of dollars of equipment and the lives of my soldiers every single day. I am held to a higher standard than all of my civilian peers. I have real world skills and marketability, leadership skills, knowledge in my field (logistics), and more experience than all your degrees.

I know Combat Engineers don't really build anything, when I was deployed they mostly blew shit up. What is the day to day life of engineers like?

3. Fishing -Nothing more relaxing than a day on the river/lake with a cold sixpack and a few sandwiches.

4. Hunting - Again, I love being self sufficient. I love the thrill of taking down game, I love preparing fresh game. 

5. Camping - I like being out in nature, retreating from the modern world. I am not a big technology buff, and like the simplicity of being alone in the woods.

I don't really watch tv or play videogames. I do enjoy interacting with people via the internet, but otherwise I am a pretty unplugged guy. I like nature, working with my hands, and doing things for myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. The onus is not on me to cite something not happening. The onus is on you to give an example of a monopoly occuring naturally in the free market.

2. Businesses coukd not use coercive force because that would be illegal. This is the one thing I believe government is responsible for, protecting against/prosecuting acts of aggression. If a corporation vandalized, threatened, attacked, stole from etc another business they would be arrested for those acts of aggrssion. TmIt has nothing to do with market regulation It has to do with government defending against acts of aggression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Monopolization is extremely rare in the free market without big businesses using force. Since we (Right Libertarians) oppose all acts of aggression that would be nullified. Monopolies are usually created by the government through corporation friendly legislation. There is no evidence for a natural monopoly occuring in the free market. If you are so adamantly against monopolies, why do you support the government's monopoly of force?


The government did "technically" invent the internet. But in keeping with my previous statement, it did so shittily. It created Aparnet, a network which only communicated between 37 computers. Only when the internet was privatized in 1995 did it flourish and become usable for the average person. Even while the government was "inventing the internet" it was done through private sector research. Why didm't the free market create the internet on their own? Because the government heavily regulated the research though the FCC and blocked out private sector attempts.

<TEXT> Hey y'all,

I am originally from Baldwin County, but I have been in the Army for the past few years. I am nearing my transition date and preparing to move to Birmingham to attend UAB. I had some questions about the city.

1. What is the city vibe like? I enjoy artsy stuff, indie bookstores, theatre, live music, etc. 

2. What is the job market like? I will be looking for a blue collar job while I attend school. I have experience in logistics, plan on looking for work with either the railroad, UPS, FEDEX, manufacturing, or anything else I can do to support my family. I am really open to anything with decent pay. 

3. Anything else you wanna tell me about Bham? get me excited to move there? </TEXT>

A crypto safe always has a list of specific people who are allowed access to it, so that would be the standard the guard will follow.


To answer youe larger question, an order can be disobeyed if it violates human rights, or basic military values. Basically if an officer tells me to do something morally wrong like rape or shoot a baby, I can and will refuse it. On murkier issues if you refuse an order, you will have to present a case before court marshall and they will judge whether it was moral or not. </TEXT>

Why does this remind me of an analysis of an argument between toddlers?

<TEXT> Basically I am curious to know what form of transition you support from our current statism to a voluntary society?


I tend to support a more gradual transition. I have never been a revolutionary. I think the gradual deregulation of the markets, and drawdown of government. It seems to me that a revolutionary transition would wage havok on the markets for a while, and we would need a longee buffer time for recovery.



How can we transition from our current state to one of liberty?

<TEXT> It seems like a *huge* paradox to me that progressives tend to support an individualist social perspective (subjective morality, freedom from religious oppression, marriage equality, equality of all choices etc) but insist on a collectivist/classist economic outlook (activism against class warfare, white privilege, affirmitive action, etc).


What are y'alls opinions about this paradox? Have you ever heard any of them try to address it?

<TEXT> Christian belief system summarized; humans are all broken sinners who are mutineers against the Law of God. The punishment for such mutiny is death. Christ (who is God) died on the cross to pay the legal debt of that mutiny. He then rose again defeating the power of death and sin. By confessing our sins and believing in his sacrifice as sufficient alone for our salvation, and surrendering ourselves to Him as Lord and Sovereign, we can have our sins forgiven.


My beliefs are summarized briefly in [The Nicene Creed](http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html) and more in depth in [The Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)

The differences between denominations are very nuanced and hard to explain in summary. It really depends on which denominations you are asking about. Basically there are three broad divisions

1. Roman Catholic - believe in the authority of the Pope, and the various vatican counsels as authoritative.

2. Orthodox Christian - recognizes a different patriarch than the Pope. They have their own cultural heritage and body of teaching seperate from the RC church.

3. Protestant - products of the protestant reformation. There is extreme diversity within this broad heading. </TEXT>

I think the important thing is to establish your opinions on what role you each will take before your relationship gets serious and there will be no problem. I don't expect every couple to have the same dynamic my wife and I do, but if you are the kind of guy who cannot marry a career woman, don't.

I get my hair cut every weekend. I think every man should have a great barber. I love my barber shop, its a man's retreat. I actually look forward to my weekly cut. My barber gives my high and tight, shaves the sides of my head with a straight razor, and gives me a hot towel massage. All for 11 bucks.

Day to day I use brylcreem to keep my hair parted and combed.

With regards to the ladies, I am married so I don't gove a second thought to what the ladies think. My wife loves my hair. She loves right after I get a cut and the sides of my head are smooth. She also digs the smell of brylcreem.

1. I disagree with Thomas Paine on a good many things, he was not a classical liberal but way more progressive with his statist ideas.

2. My issue with food stamps was not how they were carried out, it lies with the fact that I find them fundamentally immoral.

3. I despise the idea of a fiat currency. I am not a keynsian. I suppory austrian economics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the scenario. 

If there was a reasonable threat I would step in physically. I am fully able to handle any physical situation that presents itself.

If she was just uncomfortable, I would ask her if she wanted help. I would not want to make her more uncomfortable though. 

Basically, if she was getting verbally harassed it would bleep my radar to keep an eye on her (I have a wife and sisters after all). If things escalated I would physically step in, take charge, and diffuse the scenario with whatever force was needed. 

If she is drunk, she cannot consent. Women are equal in value, but usually not in physical strength, build, and demeanor as men. As a soldier, and a southerner I would feel obligated by my code of honor to watch out for any female (or male) in a possibly dangerous situation. This is the life of a sheepdog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family recieved food stamps and is still on them.

I rejected any government assistance on moral grounds. I will not take government assistance, because I believe using the coercion of the state to take one person's money and give it to the needy is not compassion but robbery. 

I am all for charity. I have in the past accepted charity from my church, and would have no moral issue. That money was given to the church freely. I would *never* accept govt. assistance though.

Here is a [link](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) that explains laissez faire capitalism.

We believe there are free market solutions to your problems. Monopolies are nearly impossible to achieve without government help. Many monopolies pop up because the state excessively regulates the industry so that new guys can't get in (think about the Uber controversy).  Labor and consumer protections would come from the private sector. You would have consumer watchdog organizations offering analysis of products. You will also have stupid consumers who buy without doibg theor research, and they woukd have to live with the consequences of buying without research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure,

Peter explains how Christ took our sin upon himself in 1 Pet. 2:24, and 3:18. This is the idea Him taking our unrighteousness and sin-wages, and giving us His right standing in return.

John echoes this idea in 1 John 1:5 (where he explains that there can be no darkness in God the light, thus explaining our separation from God) through 2:3. He explains exactly what Paul said, that Christ is the propitiation for our sins, and that those sins are forgiven through confession.

<TEXT> The reason we apply the RPW (which you will fins explicitly in the last statement of WCF XXI vs 1, that we are forbidden from worshipping any way not prescribed by holy scripture") to worship is because we believe Sunday is the Lord's day, the Sabbath, and we are obligated to keep it in accordance with the explicit way He instituted, lest we dishonor the Sabbath. 

We don't apply the same principles to the business aspects of the church, because there is nothing holy, no obligations commanded in regards to budgets, interior designs, etc. 

Our church government is not centralized, but very decentralized. It is not independent though. The scriptural precedent for oversight above the local church is found in Acts 15, qhere the Jerusalem Council exercised oversight on the matter of Greekness vs Jewishness. 

We believe there is nothing holy or significant about a name. Our name is simply another necessary business aspect of church organization.  </TEXT>

The path to life is the confession of our sin, and surrender of ourselves to Christ's sovereignty, aknowledging belief in his death on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice that bore the weight of our second death and his resurrection as a victory over both deaths.  </TEXT>

If I murder the CEO of a large company, would that have some effect on the market? Sure. Does that make murder a free market issue? No. Just because the market is free, does not mean our other rights are nonexistent. Each individual owns himself. You should be allowed to work and sell and buy without state intervention, but you are never allowed to commit acts of aggression. That is the fundamental premise of right libertarianism. The market is free, and you are free, you are simply not allowed to hurt people, own people, or take their stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Slave labor is a violation of the nonaggression principle. It has nothing to do with being a labor issue, it is a basic liberty issue. A libertarian society would operate under the assumption that everything being legal except acts of aggression.

If a child comprehends a contract, and is willing to trade his services in exchange for wages, I am fine with that. We would have to have lawyers that ensure the child understands the contract fully. If he is in any way being coerced into working, it is an act of aggression and therefore illegal. Again, nothing to do with regulating the market. The child must be able to comprehend what the contract means, and left free to quit that association whenever he/she wants. Otherwise, I see no problem with letting them decide if they want to work.

BTW, you will note in my original comment I never said I was a full ancap. I lean ancap. I believe the existence of night watch state is necessary. I believe the state should only intervene to prevent/punish acts of aggression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I meant to say state action in the marketplace. My mistake.

Because I believe I should be allowed to work for however much or little I want. If I choose to accept conditions below minimum wage, that is my business. I have in the past worked for low wages, and would again. I don't like the state telling me what I must work for. I also don't like the state pretending to be my nanny. I believe as an individual I have the right to agree to any contract I want. It is not the state's business what I choose to work for. 

If a union wants to argue with an employer about wages, that is their business. I don't care what they do. Everyone in that union has the right to free association, and if they can strike or whatever to get the employer to agfee to their contract that is all fine. I don't believe it is ever the state's job to intervene though. The state should enforce contracts, not make contract demands. It is the individual's (or group of individuals') responsibility and right to make any contract they are willing to agree to.

Since I believe life begins af conception, I believe abortion is an act of aggression against a human life, which I would never support under any circumstance. Violence should only be used in defense and never aggression.

I am a libertarian laissez faire capitalist. I believe the markets should be free from state control. I did not come here to egg on a political discussion though, that was not the intent of my OP. </TEXT>

If a church or elder in our presbytery wants to stop being Calvinists, or refute paedobaptism, or teach something different than the standards, we have grounds for discipline. It is easy and simple.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. We are strictly bound by the Book of Church Order with regards to those things. The BCO operates with the Regulative Principle as it's foundation. We do not operate congregationally, we have a plurality of elders because we believe that is the example of scripture, there is no other option. There is only one way we do things. We have a presbytery with authority to exercise oversight over local churches because we see that in scripture.

<TEXT> By we, I mean all EP Reformed Presbyterians. I can speak for all Exlusive Psalmody Presbyterians because we have very strict confessions which we subscribe to. We do not allow deviation from the Westminster Standards. 

All of us believe exactly the same on everything in the confession. We do not believe in individual interpretation. 

Some confessional presbyterians deviate very slightly from exclusive psalmody and allow hymns as well. Nonetheless, even they would be *very* strict about what is allowed in worship.

We do not use instruments in worship. There is some debate about the use of instruments within the RP camp, but my particular group does not.

Your religion is free to define marriage however they like, but they cannot force those beliefs on others.

<TEXT> Libertaran here.

I would not say Pres. Obama is a socialist, he is a progressive democrat. 

We disagree on the role of the state. We believe the markets should be free, and nobody should be forced to pay for other's welfare. We believe welfare should be accomplished through voluntary association (i.e. charity, relgious organizations, and non-profits.) We believe the state should not force contracts on people. It is up to each individual to negotiate and decide what contract he is willing to work for (or join a union voluntarily to band together to bargain collectively). 

There are some things I do agree with progressives on. For example, open borders, drug legalization, marriage equality etc.

Libertarians and Republicans are *nowhere* near alike.  </TEXT>

What kind of world would it be if the government told me what I was allowed to work for? Am I not an individual? Why should they force me to accept their conditions? I want nothing to do with them, yet they are going to force me to work for 7 paid sick days, thus removing yet one more thing that might distiguish me from other job applicants.

I say leave me the hell alone. What benefits I choose to work for is none of their damn business. If someone else wants 7 paid sick days, 15 dollars an hour, etc, they can go find that job. If I am willing to work for less, with no sick days, why shouldn't I be allowed to? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are celibate, then yes.

If you are engaging in sexual relations with the same sex... Maybe. Let me explain. 

Christians can sin. If you are a Christian, and are attracted to the same sex, and slip and have sexual relations, you do not lose your salvaion or anything. 

If you are living a life of outright noncelibate same sex relations, that is not an indicator of discipleship. True disciples do not live in blatant sin for extended periods of time.

I take the traditional and orthodox stance that same sex relations are a sexual sin, just like adultery, lust, sex outside of marriage etc. A Christian can slip and be involved in any of those sins. A Christian cannot live a life of blatant disobedience in any of those areas for an extended period of time. </TEXT>

We acknowledge the paganistic core of these holidays, and therefore do not acknowledge them as Christian. If you go to our churches on Easter Sunday or the Sunday after Christmas, it will be no different than any other Sunday.

Usually we celebrate them as fun cultural holidays, but we place *zero* religious significance in them.

<TEXT> In the denominatin I grew up in, SS was always the packaged lifeway spiel. I got nothing out of it. I was always way more advanced, and comparing biblical principles to pop culture always annoyed the crap out of me.

Since I have made my journey to Reformed Presbyterianism I have loved SS. We always have very beneficial discussions at my church, our teachers write their own material, I love it. Now I teach our young adult SS class, and it has been wonderful.

I think it depends what circles you run in. Super grounded/confessional churches tend to take their theology way serious, this carries over into small group. This is what I look for in SS.. My experience with more broad evangelical circles has been very different. I am not a fan of the super chill social club SS ideal. </TEXT>

1. What do you think about the censorship going on at the Gitmo library? Librarians and library supporters tend to be very anti-censorship, but I am curious if circumstances determine our vehemence? Should we strictly regulate what a society of extremist affiliates are allowed to read?

2. How important is it to have a library in a place like Gitmo?

<TEXT> First, I would make a distinction between "will" and "pleasure". I believe it is the will of God to ordain all things (including the judgement of the wicked) for his glory. This does not mean he takes pleasure in their demise.

In regards to Ezekiel 33:11, I believe this is God using human language to describe divine thought. The point ot this text is the individual responsibility of every man for his sin. The point of this text is not an explanation of the redemptive plan of God, but rather a plea for repentance aimed at an ungodly nation.

<TEXT> Your disconnect is that you see baptism explicitly tied to profession of faith, and we do not. I do not believe any of those references explicitly refer to baptism being predicated by belief. Baptism is tied to the death, burial, and ressurection of Christ in the sense that it identifies the baptized one as a member of the covenant which Christ's sacrifice paid for.

The issue is, fundamentally, we do not interpret a single scirpture about baptism as referring to it being predicated by faith. 1 Cor 11:28-29 are quite obviously referring to believers. </TEXT>

The main reason is the aforementioned, 1 Cor. 11:28-29 make it clear that the recipient of the Supper must be able to **examine themselves** and **discern the broken body of the Lord**. 

Those who support PC often claim this verse is referring to being able to discern the supper belonging to the body (i.e. the Church) as opposed to being able to discern/understand that the supper *is* the body of Christ.

Second, Christ often veils his words in the gospels. He reveals himself to those he chooses, but veils himself to others. He fully intends for the pharisees and jewish leaders to think he is lying, so he can be crucified. He *wants* to be convicted and sent to die. 

I believe it works the same way today. God reveals his gospel to those he chooses, and hardens the reprobate's heart. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because infants are not capable of examining themselves so as not to partake of the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner (1 Cor. 11). That is the simple answer.


Baptism is a continuation of circumcision. Obviously infants in the OT were circumcised. 

The Eucharist is a continuation of the Passover supper. Do you think infants partook of the paschal lamb? They were present, of course, just as our infant children are present at the Eucharist, but I doubt they partook.

We believe baptism is a sacrament which does not require anything of the recipient. The Eucharist requires the ability to cognitively examine oneself, as per 1 Cor 11. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Will give sources when I get home

The worship of Baal and Moloch included child sacrifices. Many scholars believe the worship of Ishtar included (forcible?) temple prostution. Herodotus includes accounts of temple prostitution in his work. 

As a confessional Presbyterian, I do not believe God has changed his message. I do not see a break between the Old and New Testaments. I see the scriptures as one Covenant of Redemption, with various stages of completion. We are simply in a later stage of the plan. The Law still stands but has different implications for us after Christ than before. It has not lost its validation though.


I can go into more detail in a while, once I have gotteb home, and provide better sources if you would like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> God called for the death of these pagans as judgment upon them. He was establishing a Kingdom of Righteousness amongst a people of violence and wickedness. He was violently overthrowing their exploitative wicked religions, in order to plant His people in the land. 

The application to today is that God takes idolatry seriously. Although the actions might not carry the same physical ramifications today, God's atttitude about those actions have not changed. 


We are no longer in a time where our world is run by overtly bloodthirsty pagan taskmasters who offer human sacrifices and sexual slavery to their gods. Imagine living under barbarism like that, would you not support the violent overthrow of such a system?

Second, no, I do not believe a fetus is committing an act of aggression against the mother. *The fetus is not the initiate*, the act of sex was the initiate. If you want to use your homeless man scenario, pregnancy/abortion would be like me going out and finding a homeless man, bringing him into my home (initiating the act) and then murdering him because he is in my home... The fetus does not choose or initiate the act of pregnancy. Therefore, the fetus could never be the aggresor. If violence is taken against the fetus, the mother is the aggressor because she initiated the entrance of the fetus into her womb, and then killed the fetus for being there.

If someone is trying to kill me, then any violence on my part is not *aggression*, but *self-defense*. 

If someone breaks into my home, they have commited the act of aggression, both by aggressing against my private property, and presenting reasonable threat to my family's wellbeing.

I am not a pacifist by any means. I am a Non-Aggressionist. There is a colossal difference between the two.  </TEXT>

That is the fundamental principle. Aggression. If a fetus is a human, then abortion is aggression. 


If there were, somehow, another way to create human life (cloning for example) I would just as adamantly oppose aggression against that created life.

<TEXT> Most profitable blue collar trades require some skill traini g first. Do not think you are just going to transition from an office job with no trade skills into a profitable and fullfilling blue collar job easily.

That being said, there are a ton of great opportunities out there for guys willing to learn. Welding, pipefitting, electrical work, plumbing.. all of these jobs can be very profitable. 

My suggestion would be as follows

1. Do not quit your job until you are ready to transition into your new career.

2. Look up labor statistics for your area. Get in contact with local labor unions. Figure out what blue collar jobs are in demand in your area. Sometimes the profitability of a blue collar career can change dramatically from city to city.

3. Once you figure out some options, figure out how to get certified in that trade. Most trade unions have trade school type programs. Votech schools also are a viable option. These things are not always very expensive.

There is a huge market for skilled blue collar labor out there, but do not let your desire for another kind of career drive you to jump ahead of yourself. </TEXT>

Libertarianism is not a solution, it is an alternative. An alternative which I believe to be the best alternative with the least amount of oppression. There is no possible way to eliminate all badness in the world. 

I think people have generally done a good job in the past looking to outside sources to make informed consumer decisions. Sure, there are dumb consumers who just buy things for their logo, but there are a lot more people to use information to become a knowledgeable consumer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think in the absence of such laws, we would see consumer watchdog agencies spring up which can effectually combat such a thing. The business owner who felt slandered could ask the watchdog group look into the matter, the watchdogs would then release info stating that the product was actually quite legal and the owner of the other business was lying. At which point the other business would lose profit because of their dishonesty and dirty marketing. And the slandered business would likeley gain more business.


I still do not see such a scenario as terribly realistic. Businesses are not able to steal tons of business from competitors by spewing ungrounded claims. Such claims are easily researched, and tend to be horrible for business once the truth comes out.

It is not as if we do not have businesses lying about other businesses today. And watchdog groups generally do a pretty good job exposing slanderous claims.


The reason I am against slander/libel laws is because speech is terribly subjective. There is not an objective standard. You could claim any number of things were scandalous. I could be telling the truth about your product, and you cover it up so well that I end up getting sued and lose all credibility while you continue with your harmful product. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My answer would be that it is not the state's responsibility to regulate these things. So no.

If you slander or commit libel, there will arise a counterbalance to your speech. An example of this is the internet. The internet is unregulated generally, and there are many false internet myths, and slanderous statements about people. Organizations like snopes have arisen to prove these myths false. That is how libertarians would like to see society function.

Just because speech is free from government intervention, does not mean it is free from blowback. For examlle, if I owned a theatre, I would likely make it a rule that false claims  of fire or disaster are punishable by a permanent ban from the premises. I do not think the "crying fire in a theatre" example is really valid, because it is so unlikely. Such a thing would never happen. And of someone did yell fire, I do not believe people would go screaming for the door with no proof. 



TL;DR;  we want no regulation of speech at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Especially in light of the Charlie Hebdo tragedy, a ton of Christians I know are showing solidarity with the Jews of France, while saying nothing (or saying derogatory things) about the Muslims of France... 

In my opinion, both religions are equally false. **But from a human standpoint, we should stand against all injustice and demographically oriented oppression.** I agree with neither Muslims or Jews on theological points. Neither religion carries more weight in my book...But many Christians seem to blindly accept all Jews as brothers, and label all Muslims as bloodthirsty heretics..

Anyone else wanna weigh in on this?

1. The book club, as far as I know, is 100 percent female. That is not a problem. I am just curious, would it be kind of awkward for one married man to join a book club full of married ladies?

2. For those of you in book clubs; how has actively participating in the book club enhanced your reading experience?

I do not know anyone who has been on Mars, but I believe it to be just as the photographs depict it.

Other denominations who were at the head of the prohibitionist movement switched to using grape juice. One of the fellows who started Welch's grape juice company was a vehement advocate for teetotaling, and tried to advocate for grape juice being used at the communion table. 

That divide still exists today. Many of the more fundamentalist Christian denominations who advocate teetotalism use grape juice instead of wine at the Table. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **OP**

1. I am in the Army. I work in a motorpool helping maintain trucks. 

2. I bring an old green stanley lunchbox with me to work everyday. It is usually filled with a bar of lava soap, moonpies or little debbie cakes, two sandwiches (usually bologna or salami on white bread), chips or a small green thermos of soup, and a can of coca-cola. I also bring a gallon jug of sweet tea that I consume throughout the work day and whatever book I am currently reading.  I get about an hour lunch break. I scrub my hands, sit down in my office, and eat at a back desk, taking my time.

3. I usually use my lunchbreak to either listen to a podcast (either *This American Life*, *How Stuff Works*, or *Planet Money*), or reading a bit of whatever book I am currently working on. After my break I am usually energized to finish the rest of the day (which tends to be long). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a pretty staunch libertarian, strong advocate for decentralization, and near ancap. I have a few reservations though. Perhaps y'all could help me.

1. What happens to nukes in Ancapistan? Obviously worldwide anarchism is not going to happen overnight, so even if the U.S. becomes a voluntary society, Russia, China etc will still have powerful weapons, and might seek to take advantage of what they see as a vulnerable situation. How do we as a society of individuals protect ourselves against these weapons? Also, what happens to the nukes the U.S government owns once it disbands?

2. Along those lines, how does a voluntary society protect itself from a sadistic individual obtaining a WMD? Say someone gets the money and ability to buy a powerful weapon. How do we stop him from killing thousands?

3. If the U.S. government disbanded, do you not see it as likely that another nation would try to use coercive force to take over? How could we possibly arm ourselves well enough to prevent that without a professional military.


These are just a few of my reservations. I definitely think liberty wins, and that ancap ideals can be implemented over a small scale, but I have a really hard time seeing it as a large scale option... </TEXT>

2. Are the hours as bad as I hear? Being in the military has gotten me used to long hours, being away from my family, but I have heard many horror stories about railroading.

<TEXT> As the title says I am an avowed laissez faire capitalist libertarian looking to engage some socialists respectfully. I have some honest questions, I am not trying to argue or pick a fight, just looking for a civil conversation.

1. What do you think the biggest misconceptions are about socialism?

2. What is your opinion as a full socialist about mixed economies (like the U.S) where the market is neither totally free or totally socialist?

3. Do you see any difference between laissez faire capitalism and crony capitalism?

4. What books or media would you recommend to me so I can honestly understand the socialist perspective?

5. What would change in the U.S if it became a fully socialist country?

6. What things do people think would change in the U.S. if it were a socialist country, but would actually remain the same. 


Sorry to lump my questions all together, I did not know of a better way. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

They then regulate environmental practice on this land "it is their private property" and regulate guns, the market, and such (I.e. if you don't obey they kick you off their "private property". They leave a will that states every four years the people must elect a fixed number of people who become "property owners" of this land mass.

"Upon this soul is stamped the seal of the divine attributes. In his intelligence man dimly reflects the divine wisdom; in his affections, the divine benevolence ; in his conscience, the divine rectitude; in his will, the divine power. Such a being can find his true sphere only in God. All these endowments point to that august source from which they are derived, as the only goal to which they can aspire; and the comprehensive act in which they all embark is the homage of an intelligent and eternal worship."

1. If Leithart is a TE at a CREC church, why is this an issue for the PCA presbytery in whose geographical bounds he is ministering in? Restated; since he isn't working in a PCA church, how does this affect Evangel Presbytery? 

2. Why does it seem the presbyteries are more keen to address his unconformity with the Book of Church Order, while still not addressing his unconformity with the WCF (FV)? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Indentured servitude? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-13 18:32:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Curious as to what y'all think about the concept of indentured servitude as punishment for nonviolent crimes. To clarify I don't mean *slavery*, at least not in the antebellum sense.

What I mean is, if someone violates your property rights (fraud, theft etc) then they have to work without pay for a period of time.

This could be done two ways

1. The criminal could work for whoevers property rights they violated.

2. The criminal works at a special labor camp.

Of course, it would have to be done humanely. No violations of NAP upon the "prisoners". Feed them, etc. But instead of sending them to a prison where they simply are turned into more violent criminals, we send them to work without wages for a period of time relative to their crime.

Is this a wacky idea? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the soul can do without everything except the word of God, without which none at all of its wants are provided for. But, having the word, it is rich and wants for nothing, since that is the word of life, of truth, of light, of peace, of justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of wisdom, of virtue, of grace, of glory, and of every good thing. It is on this account that the prophet in a whole Psalm (Psalm cxix.) and in many other places, sighs for and calls upon the word of God with so many groanings and words.

Again, there is no more cruel stroke of the wrath of God than when He sends a famine of hearing His words (Amos viii. 11), just as there is no greater favour from Him than the sending forth of His word, as it is said, "He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions" (Psalm cvii. 20). Christ was sent for no other office than that of the word; and the order of Apostles, that of bishops, and that of the whole body of the clergy, have been called and instituted for no object but the ministry of the word."

<TEXT> What beer related bucket-list items do you want to accomplish before you die?

Mine follows:

2. Drink *Calvinus* which is brewed only in Geneva.

3. Drink at the Wittenberg brewpub in Wittenberg Germany.

4. Visit all of the Belgian Trappist breweries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me, I like traditional beer styles. Stouts are my favorites, and I also love the traditional ale styles. I rarely ever try cutting edge, innovative, or nontraditional styles (odd combinations/ingredients, hard liquor in beer etc) beers. They just don't interest me. Plus, with all the stouts out there to try, I have enough on my to-drink list! About as nontraditional as I typically go is something like a peanut butter milk stout.

What about you? How often do you venture into the new styles of the beer world?

<TEXT> I'm gonna be honest. I do the unthinkable... sometimes, I drink Budweiser. Now I usually drink craft beer. But sometimes, is there anything wrong with just drinking a cold one the same way you'd drink a coke? 

Sometimes my more snobby craft beer friends hate on my for drinking Bud or Yuengling while watching the game or barbequing. The fact is, when I'm doing those things I intend on drinking more than six beers, and drinking them easily. I'm not drinking them for complexity etc.

anyways, how do you feel about the snobbier side of craft beer? Do you avoid macro's at all times?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just curious what the various approaches are. Do you have a regular time for family worship (devotions)? What do you do during that time?

Our family does every night. We open with a psalm or hymn, then we will read either a question from the Larger Catechism or the Heidelberg. Afterwards we will get into whatever we are studying. Sometimes we go through a book of the bible, sometimes we explore a particular topic, sometimes we use a book or other material (notably Paul Miller's material). We usually close with prayer time for various and sundry requests. Though we don't have kids yet, when we do we are considering using the New City Catechism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is very hard for me to choose, but if I had to narrow it down it would be a toss up between Thomas Watson, Thomas Brookes, and Samuel Rutherford.

1.  Watson's *Art of Divine Contentment* was phenomenal.
2. Brookes's *Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices* has probably had more of an impact on my walk than any other book.
3. Rutherford's *Letters* taught me a lot about compassion, and still provide a continual source of comfort and pastoral encouragement when I am away from home.

<DATE> 2014-05-10 21:46:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 21 years old, trying to start my long term investment vehicle. I'm seriously considering a Roth IRA because of the tax benefits. (I am sure my tax bracket is lower now than it will be when I retire). I've heard a lot lately about Indexed Life Insurance policies and Annuities. It seems they give you a floor so you won't lose money, and you can withdraw the cash benefit anytime. It seems like flashy smoke and mirrors to me. 
   My question is, what do y'all think? Which investment vehicle performs better, and is likely to leave me in a better position at retirement? </TEXT>
