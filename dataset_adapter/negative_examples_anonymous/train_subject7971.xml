<TEXT> It's not that they published them, it's how they got them that will be the issue. All ESPN has to do is defend the right to protect its sources if this turns ugly and it may. The hospital may have a responsibility to discover how or if the law was broken here. 

As an aside, it's weird that ESPN even felt compelled to publish them. I mean, a missing finger is not something anyone in sports can easily hide. Why would the team's organization deny it? They'd have to address it. It's not like the medical records are disclosing some mysterious illness. </TEXT>

Just to be clear: If someone at the beach were to smack this photo happy 'journalist,' take his camera and fling it in the direction of the resident shark, the gofundme to handle the legal cost for this citizen avenger will soar.

<TEXT> A separate point: Ask CCSU where most of its graduates end up. They will tell you that many stay in the state and locate in Central Connecticut. There are many people who will rent off campus housing and then stay in that housing once they graduate and start working. These are exactly the people you want in New Britain. Adopting housing regulations that deliberately attempt to force them out of town, is a non-starter for NB's future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm fundamentally optimistic about NB. 

I do think that NB has much potential, especially as a magnet for young people. The housing, parks, access to education and good transportation links weigh in its favor. 

Personally, I'd like to see the city capitalize on the new bus system and focus on building housing in its downtown, especially condos that are affordable and appealing to young people. I do think Central Connecticut is moving in the mass transit direction, gradually, and to a point where people may choose to live without a car and rely more on mass transit, and I think NB should capitalize on it.  

My point is that the tendency to point fingers at the most recent mayor(s) overlooks the historical trends that many good people who served in elected office have been unable to overcome.

<TEXT> New Britain has been in a deep hole for decades. It completely lost its manufacturing base in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the retail relocated outside its borders. It lost a huge portion of its downtown land to two massive intersecting highways.

There is no mayor who can fix these problems. Any candidate who says they can is delusional. There is no one mayor responsible. Where do you start? With the redevelopment decisions in the 1950s and 60s that destroyed many of the city's most architecturally unique buildings? Remember the Strand? Probably not. Or the decision on the highway? Or the shift in retail away from downtown to West Farms? What mayor do you blame for the massive lost of jobs and tax revenue? Almost every effort by the city to bring in new developers comes up short in some key aspect. Who is the major developer of downtown? Over the last three decades NB is. First, it renovated City Hall. Then it renovated the Gates building to create a new home for the school department, and it built a new police station. The state is responsible for the other new downtown development. CCSU and the court house complex and now the bus system. There's almost no private sector interest. New Britain's economic strategy has been on life support since the 1980s. 

Although you may want to blame this mayor or that mayor or whatever, New Britain's core problem is it has no tax base other than a residential taxbase. It can't tax what it doesn't have. It's increasingly dependent on the redistribution of wealth via the state. 

There's no demand for what New Britain offers: Empty industrial lots. 

I'm not writing this as an apologists or defender of any mayor. The fact of the matter is New Britain -- all tiny 13 sq miles of it -- has completely lost its economic tax base to its neighbors and China. There's almost no room to build anything in the city anymore, and other towns have reaped the benefits from the spending power of New Britain residents who buy almost everything, other than groceries, outside of the city. 

The longstanding efforts to revitalize downtown have lurched along because there's no population growth in NB or in Connecticut. There's no real job growth, and if the insurance industry keeps consolidating ...

<TEXT> Is it legal to define "students" as a separate group, and then set up a rule to discriminate against them? 

And restricting by parking? The drafters of this legislation know that the vast majority of multi-family houses do not have enough offstreet parking. This legislation appears to limit -- "three (3) bedrooms -- (3) three spaces" -- so does this mean you can have a three bedroom unit (common enough in a three-family house) and not be able to rent to students because you don't have corresponding three off-street parking spaces?

This is a totally BS piece of legislation. 

New Britain can't treat students as a separate class of people and apply special rules against them. It can't. It can't say these rules only apply to students, and not to people who are not students? You can't do that. 

(Here's something else: A lot of CCSU students are vets. They don't want to live in dorms. I was one. Putting in a requirement that a family contact be available is offensive to the extreme.) 

New Britain needs to grow up. If the corporation counsel gives this ordinance a green light, I would strongly suggest that opponents counter with a resolution for a second opinion from a lawfirm with real expertise in these matters. 

 I hope NB is sued over it.

 If you are writing up a layoff that involves tech workers, there's a very good chance they were replaced with lower cost foreign workers in the U.S. on a temporary H-1B visa. Their severance may have been contingent on training their visa holding replacement.

<TEXT> Fine idea. But would rather see a support infrastructure for local bloggers who are committed to local reporting: help with design, legal issues, and most importantly, a clearinghouse or network that can funnel ads to local blogs. 

There are many local bloggers trying to do some reporting. But they make zip from things like google ads, and don't have the experience, time or technical know-how to sell local ads. 

Instead of creating a jobs program, this $3 million would be better spent incubating and helping local bloggers establish a base. 

Another reason I'd have problems with a jobs program, I'm also mistrustful of any program that selects people for the job. Based on what criteria? I'd run, instead, with self-selected people who have already demonstrated some commitment to local reporting.   </TEXT>

In a time where news orgs are changing designs every two or three years, Drudge keeps his format simple, consistent, so 1990s. And it works. 

There's a case to made for consistency. People like it. It's like the Citgo sign at Fenway. It started as a sign; now its an iconic landmark. It's part of the landscape. People love it. It's part of what they identify with, and that's what Drudge is now -- an iconic site that people now read what they want into it: It's conservative, its influential, its .... whatever. You can look at the links and debate those things. But the one indisputable thing about Drudge is its consistency, and it works with readers. That's what news orgs should be thinking about.

<TEXT> If you are set on that area, live closer to 17th. There's more restaurants. It's a closer walk to Adams Morgan, U and P 14, etc., and feels far more like a neighborhood with all the basic shops you need, plus some decent hang-out places. There's a Soviet Safeway nearby and Whole Foods. 

There's a lot of really high-end housing west of Connecticut., and some decent restaurants, but not much else, other than what's on that part of P and Connecticut. If you move there, seriously, you'll spend most of your time crossing Connecticut to get to the East Side.  

Being closer to Georgtown is nice, but that part of town grows old fast. It's more of an out door, higher-end shopping mall surrounded by lovely townhouses. But it does have a good movie theater, an Apple outlet, some good bicycle shops and a decent running store. 

And as far as safety goes? All these areas are safe. But this is a city.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  No hubris among a lot of low to medium paid scribes doing their best, who had little, if anything good to say about their counterparts doing the same thing, often for less money, in radio and television?

Huh? Not in my universe. There was very little interaction with TV/radio people with 90% of the things we wrote about it. Sure, they were there for the big stories but that was it. I don't know why TV/radio felt put upon; perhaps there was something different about your market. There was almost a complete separation in social spheres because there was little cross-over in working environments. The state house guys, print and electronic, might share a beer, but us city scribes never really interacted all that much. 

for less money

You might want to check that. 

What killed the great American newsroom was the inability of it's business model to adapt to changing circumstances.

Agree, but I don't think they could have changed successfully.  There was no way our newspaper could have survived after our city  in lost roughly 90% of its manufacturing employment and most of the retail shifted to a mall outside the city limit. 

way print journalists were eager to brand themselves as the only "real" journalists doing any work. 

If you don't like print journalists, okay. 

belief that one medium possessed an inherent superiority over another had more to contribute to the decline of newspapers than anyone connected to them is going to be willing to admit.

Again, I don't get this. The best reporters never moved with a "inherent sense of superiority," they worked with a sense of humility, an understanding of how little they really knew, and a deep sense of responsibility, because they understood (in these pre-Internet days) that they had been given a great deal of responsibility to report the news accurately, fairly and fearlessly. I don't recall people sitting around nursing grudges, real or imagined, over things that hardly mattered.

<TEXT> Back in the day, our news operation had 80% penetration in some of communities. Perhaps news organizations didn't "stitch people together," but they clearly connected them to information. The daily newspaper I started my career at in 1981 didn't keep its readers because of hubris, but because of reporters and editors who produced quality content day after day. 

It wasn't hubris that ended this. There was nothing wrong with the business newspaper model because it was perfectly tuned for economic environment that began vanishing in the 1960s, and before. 

There was no hubris, just a lot low to medium paid scribes doing their best. 

What killed the great American newsrooms was the loss of an ad base as manufacturing declined and retail shifted away from the urban core; it was the advent of corporate journalism, that swept in and acquired vulnerable independent operations. They promised modernization and improvements, but most of what they did was lay off people. And finally it was shift in advertising to multiple models, the arrival of the Web browser in the 1990s that dispersed content and advertising. 

Hubris. Not for a minute, at least among the reporters and editors. Just sadness as careers and lives were swept away with the changing times. 

Yes, the journalism has been separated from the newsrooms of old, and has created many new opportunities. But the newsrooms of their day were great places, full of life, energy. I feel sorry for the folks today who will never experience the great thrill of a newsroom responding to a big story, and barroom banter that followed.

<TEXT> That's impressive, bold, and I love this line in it: "Governor, Indiana is in a state of crisis. It is worse than you seem to understand."

Indiana is at real risk of becoming an economic backwater. The corporate protest is amazing. I don't recall anything quite like it. They understand something about today's high-skilled, mobile workforce that the lawmakers who back this bill just don't get. The last thing the Indiana newspaper needs is another economic hit, the loss of major sports tournaments, convention business (7 major sponsors pulled out the Indy Big Data Conference schedule in May over the past couple of days), and an always-on-the-defensive state.  

But this front page, screaming editorial, also hints at the desperation in this business.

<TEXT> SOP, especially in regard to the White House. It happens on their phone briefings as well. 

Nonetheless, there were a few good question and they elicited non answers. 

One very pointed question was about security of the server. It was nicely framed, dead on target. 

This was one of the best questions. (Transcript: http://time.com/3739541/transcript-hillary-clinton-email-press-conference/)

*QUESTION: Madam Secretary, two quick follow ups. You mentioned the server. Thats one of the distinctions here.

This wasnt Gmail or Yahoo or something. This was a server that you owned. Is that appropriate? Is it  was there any precedent for it? Did you clear it with any State Department security officials? And do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary?

And then separately, will any of this have any bearing or effect on your timing or decision about whether or not you run for president? Thank you.

CLINTON: Well, the system we used was set up for President Clintons office. And it had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.

So, I think that the  the use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure. Now, with respect to any sort of future  future issues, look, I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters. And I feel that Ive taken unprecedented steps to provide these work-related emails. Theyre going to be in the public domain. And I think that Americans will find that you know, interesting, and I look forward to having a discussion about that.*


The first part of the reporter's question was dead-on and very professional. "This was a server that you owned. Is that appropriate? Is it  was there any precedent for it? Did you clear it with any State Department security officials? And do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary?"

All the short, rapid fire questions were a nice way to target one overarching query:  Did the State Dept. approve this system and monitor it for security? 

The reporter should have stopped right there. Instead, she bundled in a second question, a completely separate question, which gave Clinton a fast exit to a less thorny topic. 

I've learned as a reporter it's best just to ask one question at these dog and pony shows. The best question. If you bundle two separate topics in two separate questions -- or three questions which was also done at the Clinton presser -- your odds of getting anything answered fall dramatically. 

And if you just ask one question, and it gets a non-response, there's a chance another reporter may pick-up the thread and give it a try. If your one question isn't  answered, yell "follow-up," because the need for the follow-up will be obvious if the question isn't answered.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's the difference between curator and gatekeeper? 

The real issue is credit. MSM organizations seem to give credit, when they must, to the local blog that is first to report something significant. 

Giving credit is the best that can be done here. MSM should treat the citizen journalists in their communities the same way they treat any pub they are referencing. It helps with credibility and improves, one hopes, mutual respect.  

Curated lists arguably serve as gatekeepers because they source narrowly.   

In my city, DC, centralized journalism works something like this: A local blog, for instance, reports on planning for a new condo in the neighborhood; real estate blogs do likewise, but carry their reporting further by writing about city-wide trends and mapping it to data. The centralized pubs, The Post, Washington Times, City Paper, and neighborhood print weekly newspapers, broaden the story into an assessment of District's changing landscape, affordability issues, and demographic shifts, and, most importantly, can get top officials to pick up the phone and explain what's going on, something the neighborhood blogs, and citizen journalists, can't do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've used Sony IC recorders for years because of the transcription software: Sound Organizer and the earlier Digital Voice Editor. They have customize keyboard controls, so you can set up the Stop, Play, etc., to the key combination works best. I believe you can use this software for any mp3 file from any device, and probably other formats as well, But you are using a non-Sony recorder, you will probably have to make a number of clicks to bring up the file. Not that hard to do. 

I'm very interested in Sony's field recorders, but don't believe they have native support for Sound Organizer. They are more targeted, it appears, for people recording live music, not journalists transcribing notes. 

But very interested in hearing from anyone who prefers field recorders on the job over the more standard voice recorders.

<TEXT> This blog http://homicidewatch.org/  is a good example. The person who founded it won a Neiman http://nieman.harvard.edu/news/2014/09/laura-amico-nf-13-joins-boston-globe/

the point being is this blogger turned out something useful, targeted and focus, but most importantly, it seemed to me, it had a very clear mission. 

Newspapers don't cover local stuff very much anymore. This fellow http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/ covers local Neighborhood Advisory Commission meetings (ANC) in DC. Don't know him or his plans, but he turns out solid news reports on these meetings, and his work has been gaining readers. 

Arlington Now was nothing but one guy. The blog is not very old, but he has replicated it in four other towns and his blog is loaded with advertising. http://www.arlnow.com/ 

He created his own foothold. 

There's a real hunger out there for people who actually have local news. 

This was a tiny blog five years ago. Now it's a business: http://www.popville.com/

In my view: blogs that get readers do work. they go out and find out stuff that their readers don't know about. Basically, they function likes news orgs.

<TEXT> You will be hired in a heartbeat. At a newspaper I once worked at, we hired someone with a law degree who came to a similar conclusion about his career path. He had scant news experience but could write clearly and cleanly (editors love that) His great strength was his analytical ability, attention to detail and fact, which gave his work a lot of precision and intelligence. We loved having him on the staff, and he eventually went off to a job with a big league newspaper. 

That aside, legal training will be a wonderful background for statehouse/congressional reporting. 

Contact a local newspaper, ask to speak to an editor, tell him/her what it is you want to accomplish and ask for some freelance assignments -- just to get three or four clips. Also, don't rule out the plethora of websites that cover speciality news, they may be a way to begin to get traction. With so many layoffs, it's a tough world but there are still jobs and writers who have a solid edge (a law degree qualifies) can find work.

The root cause of it has certainly not been revealed, so jumping to a conclusion that the motive was a page view grab doesn't make sense, especially considering RS's history in turning out quality work.

I covered a long federal trial about 15 years ago that got international attention. During breaks, reporters would sometimes check their quotes against one another. I noticed that many of the EU/UK reporters knew shorthand, but the U.S. reporters did not.  

There are many instances outside the court where shorthand will help, especially for on the spot interviews. Recorders can also wig-out the people you are interviewing. 

I couldn't find a place that taught it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not fine. The Financial Times, an economic and business journal, carried the story on its front page, but with a global angle.  

The WSJ opinion pages are anti-climate change. The lack of coverage in the WSJ print edition may be a consequence of its strident editorial page policy. I think it's affecting and clouding news judgment. 

The protest could have been a jumping off point for a more introspective piece targeted to WSJ readers, such as: How much will climate matter in the mid-terms?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a few months away from 60 and here is my 401K asset allocation:

Small/mid/specialty: 34%
Large cap growth: 27%
Global International: 22%
Bonds: 15%
Balanced: 1%
Large Cap Value: 1%

I've had this asset allocation for about 10 years. Didn't touch it during the crash.  

But I was planning to get conservative, and was thinking about moving about 50% into bonds, 30% into index and large cap; 10% international and 10% small cap. 

However, with interest rate rise seemingly expected, I'm reading now that bonds may be a bad move, so not sure what do to. But with 5 years left to a theoretical retirement, I want to protect myself. Should I stick with my balance/asset allocation plan or try something else? Thanks for any insights.

What you should have tried, perhaps, was a little self-depreciation: "Sorry, I was just trying to impress you." And you smile warmly, don't give her a maximum dork look with your stupid camera, and ask instead  "How come I haven't passed you before" ...

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the 1970s, Enfield centralized all its retail development. The idea, one supposes, was to keep the residential areas residential, quiet, and free of stores. The end result is a community that was designed for cars and not for people. It is not friendly to cyclists and walkers. The problem is apparent in the mall area. There are major intersections with no walk lights or crosswalks. It is difficult to cross in some spots and hazardous. The concept of bike lanes hasn't even registered. This needs to change. I see more adults cycling, or at least trying to. Some may not have cars. Others just want the alternative, but Enfield is utterly blind to the needs of pedestrians and cyclists in the retail areas. I think this would be a good campaign issue, because discussion is needed.  Enfield's approach to planning hasn't changed since the 1970s. (EHS grad 1972), It's time for the town to change.  </TEXT>

That's bringing in 2,000 plus people in Hartford daily, and it may do more to encourage supporting economic development -- restaurants, cafes and the like -- than a stadium. It may also work as a catalyst for more housing. People want to live in downtown areas; close to amenities, mass transportation, and entertainment. Hartford is heading in that direction. 

There's also the real possibility that UConn students may use Hartford as an incubator site for new business start-ups, jobs that have real potential unlike hot dog vending. 

The stadium is weak by comparison. There's no guarantee it's going to hit attendance levels (attendance projections have yet to be made public from what I can tell), or generate significant economic development. But it will be a drag on Hartford's budget. 

The public turnout at this council meeting was an early indication that the stadium project is a very hard sell, something I don't think Hartford officials (or the Courant) realized initially. 

I'm glad the public hearing on this project isn't happening until July 21. That gives the news media (assuming they care) enough time to FOIA out all the documents that need to be delivered. 

By the way, I'm really impressed with Real Hartford's report on the public comments. It gives a full airing of what was said. Hartford needs alternatives to the Courant.

<TEXT> I wish I could remember what it cost to build the stadium in New Britain. Hopefully, it's been paid off. 

This will likely revive the debate in NB whether bringing the Rock Cats was a good idea in the first place. The stadium, near the Berlin border, offered no help to NB's downtown, the focus of its economic development.  I recall the idea of building a stadium downtown coming up, but not the reasons for its rejection. The right downtown parcel probably wasn't available. 

Hartford wants the stadium in walk-able distance to its downtown stores and shops, so they must be expecting some indirect economic benefit. Wonder if they're right.  

I just find this entire thing disgusting. It's one city against another, and the only true winner are the Rock Cats. 

So now New Britain is stuck with a useless stadium facility and Hartford residents may be taking on some debt they can't afford. 

I'm sure there will be talk about turning NB stadium over to NBHS or CCSU to use, but those teams won't drive attendance so it's going to be a big waste of space. 

I also don't get why NB officials -- apparently -- didn't see this coming. One explanation is that the Rock Cats were out to leave NB and weren't interested in any local drama. It may be that their business model is to bolt for a better deal when any lease is up. But still, the Rock Cats had an obligation to disclose their plan and see if there wasn't something NB could do to fix whatever it was they wanted addressed. Maybe they did earlier. Maybe there was some bad blood. I don't know, but the newly elected mayor seemed clueless. I'm not blaming her; this thing had to be simmering before she took office. I won't blame NB for feeling a little used by the Rock Cats, and Hartford officials would be wise to soak in some of that feeling.  

I do think the NB location was family-friendly, however. Easy to get to. Safe. Where will people park to see the Rock Cats in downtown Hartford? Will they have to walk to garages? Will it lead to an overall more expensive outing? 

Two pieces of advice to Hartford: Make sure the Rock Cats can't leave until the bonds are paid off. And remember the Whalers. Once their brand-new Hartford lease up, the Rock Cats will probably head out of state to the embracing arms of a new group of dumb bunny politicians.

<TEXT> Freelancing is ideal, but another path is to try blogging. Hopefully, you can carve out a few hours a week to do this. I don't know how successful people have been to use their self-published work as a means to a news (not opinion/blogging) job. But I believe it's possible, and it's certainly one way of getting on the radar of local news organizations, especially if you scoop them on something interesting. If you do, send a respectful note to a local editor with the link/clip and ask them if you could write this up for them. 

This is what I have in mind:

There's a fellow in DC who covers local meetings in his neighborhood and writes up reports: http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/

His coverage is straight news, and little different from a local news reporter's work. His effort is getting local recognition because fact-based stories free of rant and opinion are still appreciated. He could, I suspect, turn this blog into a source of part-time income via advertising. 

As far as age goes, you are a youngster. I'm in late 50s. I didn't get my first full-time job until about 25/26. I freelanced initially, but I would have been blogging as well ... had there been an Internet ....  

If you go the blog route, keep polishing and fixing your stories even if they are week old. You want your published work to be as sharp and clean as possible. Get an up-to-date an AP style guide, and practice writing with economy and precision. (I love this work: How to Write Short, Roy Peter Clark). Even Hunter Thompson started straight.

<TEXT> I have some serious problems with this opinion piece.  

It's author writes, "see how few women hold the programmer-journalist roles that have become so prized" and "When I do find women in these spots, theyre often doing front-end work, designing the interactives rather than doing the programming thats so highly prized."

Tech reporter here. First, only about 26% of the people in computer occupations are women, and women only constitute about 15% of a typical computer science graduating class.

Now, I'll guess that a large number of  "programmer-journalist" do not have CS degrees, but they probably have some technical training and their courses were mostly male. 

This point rang absolutely true: that women are "doing front-end work, designing the interactives" -- yes. You are more likely to find women doing Web design and user interface work because it combines art, in this case graphic arts, design and some code work.

The problem is more general and involves increasing the percentage of women who seek some technical training. At its root, this is a national problem and is not specific to journalism. That's an essential perspective and it's missing from the piece.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technically, you're right. It's in Agawam. But under a special act approved by the Connecticut Legislature the property was annexed by Connecticut. 

Connecticut residents loved that place, and so lawmakers felt they had to do something to take it away from our northern neighbors. It was justified as payback for the bad driving they inflict on our state.  

Alas, the special act was approved Aug. 17, 1969 at 2 a.m. There weren't any news reporters there to witness it, because, coincidentally, it was approved during Woodstock. To keep Massachusetts from finding out that we had just annexed part of their state, an employee from the Secretary of State's office took the freshly printed law and coded it and put the document in one place and the cipher for decoding it in another. Lawmakers pledged themselves to secrecy. It was a different era back then.   

In 1998, when Six Flags was considering acquiring Riverside, a secret council of lawmakers who knew about the then 30-year-old Riverside Park Annexation Law gathered in panic. They felt it was time to make the law public and asset the state's right over the property and thwart the sale to Six Flags. 

But, alas, there was only one clue to the location of the cipher. The secretary of state employee who hid the cipher, in keeping with the great tradition of the Charter Oak, sealed the cipher with bee's wax in a great oak tree in Farmington. This employee then retired and left for Florida and was never heard from again. Unfortunately, the tree was removed in 1973. It was located on the site of Westfarms Mall, which opened in 1974. 

This is a true story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> On a purely technical level, I would suggest this: Sony recorders, which I use, have something called a T mark. It is essentially a bookmark. Press the T Mark button when you hear something you may want to quote.  

You can manually jump ahead to T marks for playback. From the stop position, hit the fast forward on the voice recorder and it will jump from T Mark to T Mark. 

It's easier if you hook the recorder up to a PC.  The Sony voice editing software will show where the T mark is; just click on the spot. (There's no Mac version of the Sony editing software, and I really don't know if a Mac will recognize the Sony recorder as a separate drive.)

To keep track of T Mark numbers, the easiest way for me is to just keep track of how many times I pressed it. From experience, I've found it best to use the T Marks sparingly. If it's a quote I'm sure I will want to double check, I hit it. 

Using a T Mark is super fast way to zero in an quote without having to look away from a speaker in a face-to-face interview. (Or shift gaze from notepad to recorder, which I find is distracting to the person you are interviewing.) 

Almost all the Sony recorders, especially the ones with the USB port, have the T Mark function. Starting price is around $50 an up. 

Another thing I really like about Sony is the ability to customize the keyboard commands for voice editing. I can speed through a recording very quickly. 

In buying a voice recorder, you may want to look at where the T-Mark is located and consider the button layout. I don't want to accidentally press the wrong button. I have two Sony units currently: The ICD-UX533 has the T Mark button adjacent to the folder and menu buttons, and while it's a good recorder, I'm not super-pleased with this layout. I also own a ICD-SX712. The T Mark button is the lower right, separate from everything else, and easy to find by touch.

<TEXT> I worked at a time when many newspapers augment FT reporters with small armies of stringers. It was a foundation for good local coverage. The stringers were axed as time went on, and I agree that local bloggers, with exceptions, didn't replace them. 

On the issue of bad hiring I wonder if newsrooms aren't suffering from the same thing that afflicts a lot of industries. Many candidates do not make it pass computer screenings of resumes because they are missing certain certifications or skill sets. I'm not suggesting that editors use algorithms to screen out candidates, but I will argue that newsroom hiring may be too focused on credentials and has lost the ability to recognize raw talent. They may be on unwilling to take a risk on someone. I do not know.

<TEXT> Your analysis is correct and isn't yet. Yes, "too few people start blogs to cover local meetings and such." But relative to what? There are plenty of local bloggers who do the work, but in the vast blog-o-sphere, they will be always be the minority. You can't use the volume of poor bloggers to hang the rest. That's one of the problems local bloggers face; they are dismissed, under-appreciated and unnoticed, because of the sins of the many. 

I wasn't suggesting j-school was a "soviet re-education camp" -- I actually think j-school has some value today, especially since journalists will have have to know far more than than the basics. Technology and databases are too big a part of it. But I do believe that the j-school dominated newsroom management is self-reinforcing about hiring. They look for people with j-school and may be blind to great potential. Journalism doesn't require a j-school degree. In an event, the degree is low down on the list once you get past entry level. At that point, you either have the work to show or you don't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So excuse me if I don't think your average citizen journalist has the skills and judgement of someone with a master's degree in journalism. There is a reason that citizen journalism is, as you said, "an excuse for uninformed opinion pieces." It's because citizen journalists are untrained, unskilled hacks.

Where is all this anger coming from? Our business is laying off people, not hiring. Starting a blog, covering local meetings, is the new entry level "job" for a lot people. Their material may not be up your standards, and they operate with benefit of skilled editors who have seen every mistake imaginable, but bless them for trying.  

We should be encouraging citizen journalism, especially for people who want to break into the business. I really don't know any other way to do so today. Sure, you could blow a ton of money on a grad degree, but it's still about clips.

And is it smart to only hire people with a J-degree, a master's at that. How terribly sad. Editors use to value drive, curiosity, and evidence of intelligence in whatever form it took. I remember discussions in my first newsroom, 30 years ago, about whether the then increasing interest in j-school would radically change hiring practices and we wondered. 

My first newsroom, with about a dozen reporters, had two Ivy league grads with various liberal arts degrees, one with a law degree, and the balance from universities and state colleges that didn't appear on college rankings. No one had a j-degree.  One of the editors didn't even have a college degree. They were all hired because they had some good clips, could think on their feet, tell a joke, weren't easily intimidated, write a clear sentence and were relentless in pursuit of a story. I felt honored to be in their company and my hiring an anomaly. 

I get that there are fewer editors in newsrooms today, and can see the logic of hiring interns with their rookie errors squeezed out of them. But that still doesn't prepare them for what they may really need. 

Back in the day, we all knew the J-school people would take over in the end, because it's self-perpetuating. Specialization always wins out. Once someone with a masters in journalism becomes ME or EE, that sets the tone. I don't think that's a great outcome for a business that requires a lot of intellectual diversity. J-school can help turn out competent reporters, I suppose, but a great reporter is a force of nature.

<TEXT> It's a news judgment issue. The collapse of the  West Antarctic sheets means that sea levels will rise to catastrophic levels. It's now officially unavoidable. So, yes, as a longtime reporter, I'm very interested in discovering whether news organizations can really assess the implications of this finding, and, if so how do you treat it? 

Future generations will assess how this generation reported this issue; they'll see how much importance was assigned to the story, and they ask whether the journalists of this period really understood the findings.

As the saying goes, journalism is the first draft of history. Will we get it right? 

(Regarding the Bloomberg link, I used only because it seemed competent and isn't behind a paywall. There are a lot of good explanatory reports out there.)

<TEXT> Well, I will disagree. I am an older journo and stories that tend to read are fact based. Unemployment is higher for this generation; college debt is high, and that is worrisome and a lot of the reporting seems to reflect that. As far as work culture, some of the business reporting that I've seen about millennial work habits isn't negative; it's about how businesses can adapt and retain the younger generation that is likely to be very well educated, less loyal (and for good reason), and insisting on more flexibility in work/life arrangements. 

The BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) to work, something many IT department are adapting to, is being driven in large part by the younger generation that doesn't want to be constrained by out-of-date tech. 

And as far as destruction of humanity goes ... the polls seem to indicate that millennials may be the most concerned about climate change. Millennials aren't very well represented in Congress yet, so I won't fault them for causing the destruction of humanity. As far as who screwed up the economy: every earlier generation blames the older generation for this or that. It's a waste of energy, because as the saying goes, nobody is perfect. 

And regarding the journalism business: Most of the web news start-ups, I would suppose, that are roiling this business are the efforts of millennial generation, not the baby boomers. The younger generation is carving out a new paths for making journalism thrive. I hope they succeed. 

If you read something that blames the millennial generation for the national woe, just keep in mind that it was written by a dull, ignorant, full-of-crap, dense and misinformed person who probably has no idea where his/her local library is, and likely has the IQ of a hen.

Before there was Facebook, there were a lot of blogs, personal blogs, where people shared stories about their communities and reaction to things. They were open and accessible and uniquely valuable; they tended to humanize a community, and enliven. 

Over the years, many of these writers, understandably, migrated to Facebook because they're real interest was to use the blog for social networking. (And they weren't that much interested in maintaining a blog.)

But this shift to Facebook also closed the door to a lot of content. The local blogging universe gradually became mostly specialized: food, clothing, mom blogs, real estate, neighborhood, etc.  

Many of the story tellers, who had a talent for making a community alive, were posting on Facebook. They're content, for the most part, was no longer discoverable via a general search engine. 

If FB Newswire has a plan to take some of this content and allow it to find its way to the broad public domain, (something I think these writers, when asked would embrace), then it might be very useful. This content doesn't even have to be connected to any news event. 

If Facebook could find, discover and promote writing that tells us something about the world we live in and add that to your news feed, then it might be doing something important and powerful.

In data journalism, there's no easy way to know whether the data has been interpreted correctly, or manipulated to support a news hook. Other news organizations, bloggers etc., are more likely to amplify the findings instead of critically asking whether the data is accurate, complete, or represents reality.  

I've used data to support stories for decades, but in extremely targeted ways. The data was the icing, not the story. Now we have news orgs downloading every spreadsheet they can find. Danger ahead, IMHO.

<TEXT> It's not that. In Connecticut it's about the view. These things can be as high as 400 feet and have a wingspan that's massive. They are landscape altering, and having one here, one there, isn't going to make a one bit of a difference to global climate or to big oil. This will never be a windfarm state like Iowa or Texas. More likely than not, some business will put one up as an advertising gimmick to claim that that they are green. 

As it is, most towns try to shrink business signs, just to keep the landscape view pristine.  

Frankly, I think the state should do more to encourage solar. Or keep builders from constructing 2,500 square-feet plus houses, or putting in more mass transit in the Hartford region, in particular, as well as allowing higher density housing near potential mass transit centers. More bike paths on roads would be great as well.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bill, ostensibly, is design to ensure that people can take photos of police activity. But the exceptions appear to give police broad latitude to shut down photography.

This is the text of the bill.

http://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/FC/2014HB-05060-R000545-FC.htm

AN ACT CONCERNING THE RECORDING OF POLICE ACTIVITY BY THE PUBLIC.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly convened: Section 1. (NEW) (Effective October 1, 2014) (a) For the purposes of this section, "peace officer" has the meaning provided in section 53a-3 of the general statutes. (b) A peace officer shall not interfere with any person taking a photographic or digital still or video image of such peace officer or another peace officer acting in the performance of such peace officer's duties, except as necessary to (1) lawfully enforce a criminal law of this state or a municipal ordinance, (2) protect the public safety, (3) preserve the integrity of a crime scene or criminal investigation, (4) safeguard the privacy interests of any person, including a victim of a crime, or (5) lawfully enforce court rules and policies of the Judicial Branch with respect to taking a photograph, videotaping or otherwise recording an image in facilities of the Judicial Branch. (c) The Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection and the Police Officer Standards and Training Council established under section 7-294b of the general statutes shall jointly develop a model policy and training standard to implement the requirements of subsection (b) of this section in a manner consistent with public safety and rights guaranteed by the first, fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. Not later than January 15, 2015, the Police Officer Standards and Training Council shall submit such model policy and training standard to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to public safety, in accordance with section 11-4a of the general statutes, and to the chief law enforcement officer of each municipality having a police department, the law enforcement instructor of each such police department and the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection. On and after July 1, 2015, each law enforcement agency shall adopt and implement the model policy and training standard developed under this subsection. </TEXT>

April primary: Bad idea. It should be in Sept. 

Field was too busy. 

There were no issues. Everyone was running against Gray. 

I'm hoping November is better. It's basically a face off between David Catania and Muriel Bowser. With Mayor Gray out, that means these two will actually have to campaign on issues.

<TEXT> Your query prompted me to think about the writers of Wall Street Journal's All Things Digital worked under contract. They split from the WSJ and formed http://recode.net/ (Another who started with a personal brand, moved to large outfit and then returned to a personal brand, is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Romenesko) 

There's a whole emerging issue about whether journalists will actually become "brands," and operate as independent contractors with the freedom to move name and brand from pub to pub. I don't know enough about this issue as I would like. But if you have a blog with a following and good brand and you see it as a potential revenue source, then you want to protect yourself. Linking up with a newspaper may accelerate your brand and profile, and help theirs as well, since food bloggers can be very popular and great source of ad revenue. 

Personally, I'd want the ability to return my blog and brand if I parted company. I might think differently if they bought out my food blog and coupled that with a contract to write for it. But right now it sounds like you would be migrating without an offer, so you are the one in the stronger position in a sense. If they aren't offering you anything to bring your blog to their platform, it seems entirely reasonably that you should keep the brand. (Will you be giving up ad revenue that you now make on your personal blog?) 

The All Things Digital writers, and they left in one big group, weren't able to keep that brand. The WSJ retains it. I don't know how ReCode is doing; maybe it's a rousing success, I just don't know. But having to re-brand seems like a risk. 

Congratulations, I must say, for putting yourself in this position to begin with. It's an interesting issue, and the editors must think well of your work to offer.  </TEXT>

Layout wise, dunno. The "free and affordable fun," video teaser is wordy, takes up too much white space, and doesn't really compel you to click on link. It needs art. 

The side-by-side Knoxville Opera/Spring football heds seems a little too busy. 

Most neighborhood blogs use a blog-type format, and, honestly, I feel readers get confused by formats that stray away from that model. 

 I think these layouts are a little more action-packed:

<TEXT> They are promising to run the bus 3 to 7 minutes during peak, and 12-15 minutes off-peak. 

This project has gotten and will obviously continue to get a lot of skepticism. With the exception of Metro North, Connecticut has never been a mass transit state. It hasn't done as much as it should be doing for bicycles, either. 

So, I agree with the idea that you have to sell this. Not just the idea of using this system, but the entire idea of using mass transit. 

If it succeeds, it might help refocus economic development back to urban cores, particularly in New Britain and Hartford. It might spur housing and entertainment districts along key parts of the route. It wouldn't surprise me at all if it reshapes New Park Ave. in a positive way. 

The Hartford/New Britain region once had mass transit: A great trolley system. It replaced it with buses which suffered in the   two-car per household era. But Connecticut residents are smart, adaptive and responsible, and in this era of climate change, expensive fuel, more interest in bicycle commuting and mass transit, this project may work. 

I get the concern that ridership will fall short. But city after city is putting in some kind of mass transit option. Trolleys are making a comeback, dedicated bus and bicycle lanes are arriving as people fight the idea of using streets for "car storage" i.e. parking. There's always push back, but you need to ask: Why won't something like this work? 

This CTfastrak is a done deal at this point. The investment has been made. Here's hoping for a good outcome.  </TEXT>

But interest in it is so-so. Everyblock's approach, when all is said and done, doesn't offer much. People want original content, discussion, and something they can't find elsewhere. Pure aggregation tools, unattached from anything else, just haven't caught on all that well. They don't inspire a lot of loyalty or repeat traffic. 

Redditt, Slashdot aggregate but users pick the content, not software. There's a difference. 

But I think the fact that you have created this platform is a significant accomplishment and it has potential, but not necessarily as a stand-alone platform. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For starters, let's build a Manhattan Project around batteries, Renewable energy needs cheaper, cost effective, high capacity storage, and so do electric cars. 

Here's another: Great strides are being made to improve solar photoelectric cells. Would adding $26B in federal support speed up their development?

Removing C02. I have no faith that mankind will react in time to reduce CO2 levels. Can we develop technologies that can do this and make it as ubiquitous as trees? 

Federal research is increasing only incrementally. It may not be beating inflation at this point, and is declining in some areas, so I wouldn't hold out on a Manhattan Project anytime soon. Of course, Europe and China may see it differently and discover ways to improve energy storage. That will be good for mankind, but bad for U.S. industries.

<TEXT> I'm in my late 50s, and I'm wondering if I should park my 401K funds in a stability of principal fund. 

Market Watch recently had a piece warning that "Stock caution urged as margin debt levels hit new highs" http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-caution-urged-as-margin-debt-levels-hit-new-highs-2014-03-09

And the Financial Times has a piece today that Seth Klarman is warning of a "significant market correction." He is citing nosebleed valuations in tech shares, in particular. http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6dd806e2-a627-11e3-9818-00144feab7de.html#axzz2vYeDNzjM

The Bull Market is five years old, and while some argue that it will go on for a while, there is someone arguing that things will remain good for a while. People were saying the housing market would stay good right up until the time it crashed in 2008. This time, I'm inclined to agree with the bears. 

I'm not 401K rich by a long shot, so not much room to play. Should I park?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its been just a few months since I came to Los Angeles from the District of Columbia, and already it is Crystal City clear: L.A. is a downer.

Look no further then Skidrow at 7 a.m. for a pure view into the citys heart and soul. You will pass a dozens and dozens of slumped homeless veterans holding out a McDonalds cup for money. 

After committing to pay a senseless amount of money for gas for the day's trip just to dump ever increasing amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere; it's easy going from here, except for the climate-changed induced drought emergency just declared by the governor. 

Every morning its the same on the Freeway: people, sitting in their cars, with blank stares and the saddest-looking faces imaginable. Do they wonder about the environment? They are like cattle in a climate denial storm, too self-centered to take mass transit, gazing into space, waiting for their ride to the climate change slaughter house.

A rat creeps across a sidwalk. The dusty cars make a miserable sound as they screech to a stop.  I don't see E.T. anywhere. I am miserable, disappointed. Where are the starlets? Everywhere in Los Angeles you see people in T-Shirts and jeans. I miss D.C.'s civilizing dress code.

The irony runs deep. The capital of American media culture  is in fact, ugly and uninspiring. The imagine of L.A. as a colorful mecca of entertainment is a lie. The citizens who work in the movie and television industry appear to be enduring unspeakable oppression and Oscar snubs.

Please, California people, keep your mouths shut when you visit D.C. Don't write trite op-eds. Instead, keep your eyes fixed on whatever little video screen you can find. And when you return to California, preach the merits of mass transit and car-less living.

<TEXT> There is evidently an effort to ban ecigarettes on the Metro and other public places.

There was a hearing in November. Smoke Free DC testified. The testimony: http://www.smokefreedc.org/e-cigarette-testimony-dc-council/

Hearing notice and backgrounder on proposed law: http://dccouncil.us/events/health-hearing-on-bill-20-233-the-electronic-cigarette-parity-amendment-act

From what I can tell, this bill has not been adopted. Here is the legislative status page:  http://dcclims1.dccouncil.us/lims/legislation.aspx?LegNo=B20-0233

Here is the bill, the oddly named, Electronic Cigarette Parity Amendment Act of 2013

http://www.dccouncil.us/files/user_uploads/related_materials/Bill_-_E-Cigarette_Parity_Amendment_Act_of_2013.pdf

I am totally in support of a ban and any effort to deter smoking. Electronic cigarettes are nothing more than a nicotine delivery system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You probably already tried this, but the Russians have been developing an offshore IT services industry in the U.S. You can find a listing of companies here: http://www.software-russia.com/ Search global. 

I'm not going to vouch for this company because I've never used it, but I know a little about it: https://www.workmarket.com/ provides contract labor. Unlike services such as oDesk (which might also be worth checking out if you haven't), Work Market is mostly an on-site provider. It skews toward technology companies, or firms with technology needs.

<TEXT> The coop fee seems high. My experience with condo fees is if it's elevator building with 24 hour front desk and any type of common amenities, swimming pool/gym, $500 plus will be the rule. At $900+, even counting for taxes, I'd be wondering whether they added in the cost of an elevator upgrade, or some other really costly repair. And, if that's the case, I'd be wondering whether the building has adequate reserve. If the common areas appear a little rundown (rugs as past their prime, painting hasn't been done, wall paper looks old) think twice about a property. There may be bigger issues lurking, such as roof replacement, HVAC upgrades, etc. 

Another issue to note: See if the unit owners are putting off repairs as well. For instance, if the windows are long past their prime, that's a building issue even if the owners are assessed the cost.  It tells you that owners aren't willing to eat the cost of the upgrade. Buildings will usually upgrade windows all at once to keep everything uniform.

After serving on a condo board for a few years, my view is any building that lets common area repair and upgrades slip may be badly run and possibly working with an under-funded reserve. An inadequate reserve can also explain the high cost.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got rid of my car several years ago. Immediately saved $1,200 in car insurance. Use a bike a lot.

Offsetting cost is Amtrak, mostly. I spend about $200 a month on train travel. But the same trip by car took a tank of gas, and the tolls up up 95 to NYC are about $30? It's up there. 

Even though the car, for a NYC trip, is about half the cost of the train*, driving 95 is crazy, and have had multiple close calls. Now, I just sit back and get work done, read or watch of movie. 

I don't think I'll ever own a car again. 

*Cost of train to NYC: You can get Amtrak tickets as low as $50 to NYC if you order well in advance. I realize the bus is cheaper but can't stand it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The tapes have no news value. They don't advance story. All they do is offer color. They didn't need the tapes to know this. They were well aware that the tapes would say absolutely nothing new about the events of that day. 

I can understand why AP and others went to court to seek their release. Government, especially on the federal level, is taking an anti-press turn. But Connecticut has had good FOIA protections. I've brought some cases myself when I worked as a journalist in this state.  

But in seeking release of the tapes, the news orgs weren't defending any principle. They were just pulling a lever available to them and the judge knew it. He had no way to block the release of the tapes. 

This all goes back to the original decision by AP to seek release of the tapes. Was this a mechanical reaction on its part? i.e., 911 tapes are public information as a matter course and should be released? Or were they defending a principle?

I find it hard to believe that AP was defending a principle, since it's been well established that 911 tapes are public. 

If AP had not pursued the FOIA, there would have no been harm to FOIA and its underlying principles. There was nothing to protect. Seeking the release of the tapes was a news judgment decision. The news value of the tapes was marginal, and the ill-effects of publishing them are potentially considerable. News organizations make decisions all the time to withhold certain content from their readers because it's disturbing, privacy-invading, so I don't buy the arguments that there was an absolute need to either pursue or publish these tapes. 

Without any free press issues to defend, and there clearly was not one in this case, the release of the tapes is more about how the basic decencies in our country are falling away. 

All this said, I fully understand that even if AP and mainstream news organizations decided not to seek the tapes, others would have so their release was assured. But we all have to make decisions for ourselves about what we're willing to live with.  </TEXT>

I gather from this data that the methane emissions have increased in the last year. The colors have moved from yellow to red. That's disturbing, alarming, troubling, certainly interesting, but it is not horrific. 

Horrific is a sudden methane release that scrambles the climate and create new peril. (What will we say if there is a sudden methane release: Super-horrible-horrific?)

This must sound like nitpicking, and I'm guilty of being too focused on the language stuff, but I see this all the time in the headlines here and I think it undermines the scientific message. For anyone reading this board, the data alone is scary enough.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> China's innovation push is impressive. In computing alone, they have been building the world's fastest supercomputers. Those systems are using a mix of China-origin parts and U.S. tech, notably the chips. But China is making its own chips and is on path to build high performance systems that are made entirely from Chinese produced tech. This is very impressive, and China may be spending more right now to build the next generation of supercomputers than the US. 

I've been very impressed with China and the OP's story, and the comments in it, is very consistent with a policy China outlined years ago. China is going to deliver some impressive tech in due time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked as a daily news reporter for nearly 20 years, and contacting families after a particular death was the worst part of the job. It feels like a horrible invasion, but Washington Post reporter was being accurate when he wrote that people "might be surprised to learn that many people caught in this mayhem actually want to talk to reporters." That's a true statement. People often want to talk about the people they lost, they want others to understand the value that this person brought into the world and the love they shared. It's a affirmation of life. It's the reporter's job to tell the story about what's going on in our shitty world. If the family doesn't want to talk, you respect it and move on. That said, these were the last stories you want to do because it affects you deeply. I've seen fellow writers break down in tears after undertaking these types of stories. It's the last damn story you want to write. When you work as a reporter covering a communnity, you care about that community, the people in it, and you want to chronicle their stories, and let others know what their neighbors are facing. In my mind, this is a noble and difficult pursuit and sometimes misunderstood, but the Post reporter here, I think, handled it well.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stayed earlier this year at a Trump hotel in Vegas for work conference. The price was on par, and maybe even less, than some of the on-strip hotels. The Trump hotel is slightly off Strip, located on right side of the Fashion Mall. (You can cut through the Fashion Mall to get to the Venetian or Mirage.) The hotel was actually pretty good. The rooms had sinks, fridges, and coffee maker. There may have been a stove top/microwave there (but can't recall.) Very solid place, and the convenience store had things like cereal and milk and other breakfast foods. Prices were reasonable. Staff was very nice and professional. In total, the room amenities were heads above most of the Vegas hotel rooms I've been stuck in (for conferences) that don't even have coffee makers. The Trump hotel didn't have a casino and I actually enjoyed the sanity. The only issue was on check-in. They try to upsell you slightly more expensive room, pulling out a book to look at. I had no interest, but the fellow in line before me spent what seemed like 10 minutes considering an upgrade. I waited patiently.... </TEXT>

What's your stance on gambling, either online gambling or a casino? 

(Reason for question: Once Maryland builds a major casino at National Harbor, people may complain that D.C. is losing tax revenue. Similar arguments were raised in Massachusetts as a rationale for approving casino gambling in that state. Many Mass residents drove to Connecticut to gamble there. So before this becomes an issue in D.C.,  I think it is important to know how candidates feel about it today.)   </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Maryland is building a casino in National Harbor. Do you think D.C. should respond by allowing a casino within the District?

- How do you feel about bicycle lanes? Should the city expand them and how aggressively - would you pick up the pace? How important is bicycle safety and what would you do to maximize it?

- Considering the recent scandal in campaign financing, what changes do you think are needed to campaign finance laws in the District?

- How do you feel about FOIA and online access to city documents? 

- Do you support a bid to get the Olympics in the District? 

You know, if anything, maybe we can at least crowdsource questions.

<TEXT> Good point. I'm a little put off by the "terrifying" click-candy usage. There's nothing especially new here; the report refines some predictions, narrows time frames, but generally affirms consensus. Anyone who is familiar with the science and ponders feedbacks at all, considers the possibility of a methane releases in the arctic, and acidification on the food chain, is already, in a sense probably terrified or at least worried sick for future generations. Trying to scare people with yet another alarmist headline doesn't work. What we need is for elected officials to come around to the reality of the problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can live in dull-as-crap Berlin or an equally charming suburb. You can spend your weekends mowing your expansive lawn, and devote a major portion of your household budget to maintaining two cars. You can also sit around with your neighbors and work yourself up into a froth about Connecticut's "dangerous" cities. And, as we all know, nothing bad ever happens in Connecticut's suburban towns. They are islands of sanity. 

Or you can seriously take a look at New Britain, Hartford, New Haven, or some other city and imagine being part of a diverse community. You can consider how being close to the arts, shopping and entertainment might enrich your life. The concept of "walkability" might enter your life. You can downsize to one car. Ride your bike. Live a healthier lifestyle or rot away in a suburban town.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-08-13 04:51:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love Connecticut and lived there all my life until 1998 and now live in DC. I'm in my late 50s, but have many friends and family in the state and visit often. When I visit, I often hear people talk about leaving the state. The property taxes, for instance, on my sister's house are $4,600 a year and she can barely afford the bill. It won't be affordable in retirement, and that's the truth of it. It's a simple ranch in Northern Connecticut. I hear my friends complain as well. They think about leaving. Since moving, I've gotten much more familiar with the mid-Atlantic states and how they run themselves. They do some things better than Connecticut. I don't mean to be  negative. There's a lot to like about the state. It is beautiful. But there are bunch of things the state can do to reduce its tax burdens and run more efficiently. Here are my recommendations:   

1. Move to county/regional services. It's an incredible waste of money for towns and cities to pay for their own administrations, finance, information technology, police, fire, etc., for small geographic areas. This duplication contributes to high local property taxes. 

2. The taxing system and economic development effort should be regional. Take New Britain. When the factories closed, it lost its downtown to West Farms Mall. That's a simplification, but there's truth to it. Farmington gets New Britain shoppers and most of the property tax benefit. To compensate for this lack of a regional tax system, the state waste money on economic development projects in the urban areas that actually end up accomplishing little. Hartford has been an economic development sinkhole since Constitution Plaza.  

3. Get rid of property taxes on cars. It's absolutely the most horrible tax. 

4. Adopt a homestead tax provision. If you live in your home, DC reduces your assessed value by $38,000. It's a significant savings. The trade off may be higher income and sales taxes.  

5. Adopt alternative means of transportation. Connecticut's bus system is a total joke. Many communities lack sidewalks, and forget about bike lanes. The state is overly car dependent, and that makes it very expensive.

<TEXT> I was unimpressed with this piece. Explain please: What is accomplished by heaping everything on the Republicans? The Democrats have been quietly complicit. They have not pushed as hard as they might on this issue because the policy decisions are extraordinarily difficult. Frankly, I think a lot of Democrats are taking cover on Republican denial. It's too easy to blame the Republicans for everything.  I'm disappointed in the full spectrum of political leadership, including the White House's actions to date. Even if the Democrats owned both chambers, I question whether they would be much better than the Republicans in addressing climate change.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, eat, shoots, and leaves me: Whatever on the headline. 

The report itself is very clear that young voters are an election threat to the stupid, ignorant and bribe-soaked elected officials among us. 

Now, if only my we're-to-busy-watching-tv generation of baby boomers would rally to action ... 

 An overwhelming majority of voters under 35 understand the threat of climate 
change and already see the harmful effects of it, or expect to in their lifetime. 

 66% of young voters say climate change is a problem to address, while just 27% say 
climate change is a natural event that humans cant affect, and only 3% dont believe 
climate change is really happening.

 Similarly, 65% say climate change is already affecting us or will in their lifetimes. 

 This recognition of the threat, coupled with the age groups strong favorability towards the 
President, leads to intense support for action.

 80% support the President taking action to address climate change.

 Among those favorable to the President, nearly all support him taking action.

 But even among the minority who are unfavorable to him, 56% support action and just 
38% oppose.

 This widespread and intense support translates into a willingness to punish 
legislators who stand in the way of the Presidents plan... and to support those who 
back it.

 79% say they are more likely to vote for someone who supported these steps 

 73% say they are less likely to vote for someone who opposed these steps </TEXT>

<TITLE> Climate Change is playing out the same way AIDS did; adjusting for time scales, it will take 50 years for real action. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-06 02:25:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are striking similarities between Climate Change denial and what happened during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. One in particular. In the early years of AIDS it was becoming increasingly clear that it was being spread via blood (this was before the virus was discovered). Babies were getting ill as were drug users. But there was resistance from the blood bank industry, which attacked the science and epidemiological work  making these connections. That didn't last long because the accelerating rate of infections made it impossible to ignore the problem. 

However, here's another way to look at how the AIDS epidemic unfolded. Imagine that each year of the initial outbreak was actually 10 years. Something akin to dog's life math. And all of a sudden it begins to look like what's going on with climate change. If you use the decade of the 1990s as year one, (Hansen's testimony in 1988 as the starting point) then we are in year 2.5 of real climate change awareness and action. 

The first Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on what would eventually became known as AIDS appeared on June 5, 1981. It received little attention. The national news media only gave AIDS attention when it began to expand beyond the gay population, and even then attention was minimal. Policy makers, with few exceptions, ignored it. It wasn't until the problems cascaded and the number of cases grew that AIDS became a true national issue. 

This past June marked the 25th anniversary of Hansen's testimony, and I would say that the awareness and level of action about climate change is about on par with AIDS at its 2.5 year point. It took about five years for AIDS to get truly recognize for what it was. Although the deniers (and that includes people who considered it a gay disease alone) were still at work five years into the AIDS epidemic, they were being marginalized. But it took about five years for the U.S. to begin to turn real attention and money toward combating AIDS.

It will take another 25 years before the world is truly ready to deal with climate change. By then, the polar cap should be just about gone if not gone. The evidence from Greenland, Antarctica, and temperature records, will be inescapable. Similar to the number of AIDS cases at the five year point, the evidence will be beyond rational dispute.  Today, the people who deny climate change, the policy makers who refuse to deal it, and a public that refuses to understand it, still hold sway. Such as it was with AIDS when you adjust the time scales. We have a long way to go before real action is possible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a counterview: I really do think most people recognize that something is amiss. They know the growing seasons have changed, and patterns have shifted. That's my experience in talking with folks, especially older relatives. But they aren't asked the right questions in surveys that attempt to assess knowledge about climate change. 

Ask people about what they experience and see. Ask them whether they have noticed changes in growing season of plants in their backyards, different patterns in the arrival of some bugs. Ask them if they are noticing slightly earlier springs. Ask them about their memory of the weather. 

I think the answers will be a lot different than just asking them about "climate change."

It takes a sophisticated level to have the basics of climate change denial. People don't think like that. People who say they don't accept "climate change" may not even really know what "climate change" is, and aren't connecting the concept with what they observe in their world. I find, especially when talking with older people, that the best approach is to ask them what they observe.

But the force of the crash is enough to send her car either though or over whatever bridge railing is there to keep vehicles on the bridge. Her vehicle plunges 40 feet into the bay -- three to four stories of free fall. She experiences hitting the bay in an explosion of water. Injured and shocked, she is in a vehicle that's sinking and starting to drift. Her options for saving herself are narrowing quickly. Fighting current and probably disorientation, she escapes the vehicle and swims to a bridge pylon. Imagine. Just imagine.

A condo association may have the option of taking empty space and renting it out as storage. Instead, they make it available to bikers. I could see the argument on the condo board: Why should people who don't bike subsidize the loss of income the empty space might generate as storage space?  But then, there has to be enough bikers interested space to cover the cost. If there weren't, you probably wouldn't have the rental space option. Consider yourself lucky.

<TEXT> I bought in DC in early 2008 when the market was softening and the worst was still to come. I did not have a big down payment and it was risky from that point of view. Not the best decision, but what was done was done. After I bought it, the price of my unit fell about 5%-10 to perhaps as much as 20% from what I paid. It has since recovered. With a new assessment, I recently re-financed and lowered my mortgage cost by nearly a third. Previous rate was 6.5%. Now at about 3.5%. Lost PMI, too. 

My monthly mortgage, plus taxes, including condo fee (non-elevator building so its on the low side), is well below market rents. 

Rents are ridiculous now. But the mortgage costs remain low, even at 4%. 

So what should you be worried about the most? That mortgage rates will rise to 6-9% or that housing prices won't fall? 

My view: If you truly planning on staying in DC for a period of years and are set on that, then I would try to buy when the interest rates are low. If prices fall now, I suspect it will due to rising interest rates. One way or another, you'll be paying more. 

More directly to your question: I don't think we will see a repeat of 2008-09. That was a historic crash. I do believe the market can soften if interest rates rise, and I think with the rates now checking in at about 4% demand for housing may rise some as some people try to lock in better rates before they go much higher.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't blame them. This risk is readers, who may already be up to their necks in monthly subscription charges for other content, NYT, Netflix, etc.,  Hulu, Rhapsody, whatever, may resist. Subscription costs are really becoming a burden, but what choice does WaPo have?  

I dumped cable long ago to save money (use DSL) and watch TV via antenna (which is actually pretty good in DC proper) and Internet content. That has helped to offset some the subscription charges.

<TEXT> I have a 20-year old scratched-up, tear-in-the-seat, bike that's beat-up ugly. But it rides and I keep the components in good shape. When parking on the street, I use two U-locks to lock in both tires and thread a cable cord through the seat.  Not that anyone would steal it, I imagine. I've been thinking about buying a new bike. But wonder: Even with two U-locks, what are the odds that it will get stolen or damaged in D.C.? Is it even worth owning a good bike if you lock it from time to time on the street? (I'm not talking overnight, but about running errands, stopping to eat, etc.) I'm considering something like a Tern folding bike. (Something easy to take on travel and store) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have a car and absolutely do not miss owning one. DC is an easy city to bike and is getting better. The bus system is good once you figure it out and in many cases faster than dealing with Metro. 

But owning a bike isn't easy. Good bikes are at risk of getting stolen. For around town, and have plans to lock your bike on a street for some hours, recommend a beater, nothing too attractive, and lock both wheels. 

Personally, I think folding bikes are a great option for commuting if you can stash them inside.  </TEXT>

But people began to realize, even before the big defense build-up post 9/11, that DC was way undervalued compared to NY and Boston, and an attractive place to live. Yes, there's a lot of building going on now but much of it is catch-up. DC is becoming the city it should have always been considering the quality of life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The piece seems choppy, a haiku and a collection or notes for a more serious piece. I can't tell whether it's lazy, both for the writer and short-attention span readers, or thoughtfully crafted and that may be a strength. The format forces you to tell the story and tell it quickly, and that may be a plus. Is it affecting and moving? Yes, so it works as a piece. It's an experimental art form that is unsatisfying but yet manages to hang around because of its short, descriptive images. But it is not the future of story telling. The writer has real talent; he took a distant memory and gave it real-time urgency.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, that's a really great deal. I live in 356 SF condo studio, and this place is about 15 SF bigger. But it also has a backyard -- which is awesome. 

Considering the backyard, and the fact that you own your own place without condo fees, this strikes me as a very good price. 

A custom-designed murphy bed unit, will create the illusion of even more space and get rid of the kitchen-bed problem. 

Does it have a basement? Can you add to the rear of the house? Another 100 SF and you can almost claim one bedroom, and can you build another story?

This will sell quickly at $248.   </TEXT>

If DC entered into a contract that prohibits it from competing with Verizon, cable and others, then this service is permanently crippled and under utilized. It's great that when I use Mount Pleasant Library or MLK, the wifi is running at 20 MBS plus, but it would be wonderful if DC created area-wide hotspots, especially in under served areas. Good piece by Washington City Paper. This issue needs a lot more light.

There's a lot I don't like about Wal-Mart. It constantly shifts the hours of its employees (along with other retailers), and keeps them under the threshold for benefits. It doesn't want full-time workers. It wages and benefits are so awful some employees must turn to government assistance, so there's some cost-shifting going on here. 

But the savings on some its products are real. For fixed income people, being able to save a dollar on a loaf of bread is a tangible thing. They will shop there.

<TEXT> I live in Adams Morgan and parked off-street until I gave up the car. It wasn't easy and I could spend 20 minutes, routinely, driving around waiting for a space to open up. 

RPP fees would make no difference. Zero. Higher RPP fees is a nit in the calculation of whether you can live without a car. 

I gave up owning a car only because I didn't need it. Adams Morgan may be awful for parking, but it's well served by buses and the Metro lines aren't a bad walk. My job didn't require a commute mandating a car. 

But I know people who need a car to get to their place of work. If you need to jump on a bus, jump on the Metro, and then a bus again, that commute just won't work. A car is easier. 

For that matter, there are many neighborhoods in DC were bus service is not as regular as it is in close-in neighborhoods. I rarely have to wait more than 10 min for a bus. But some bus lines may not hit a stop for 30 min, 45 min or longer. 

All I can say about parking minimums is that ship has sailed. Many of the apartment complexes in Adams Morgan were built in a time when cars weren't an issue. My building only has a handful of spaces. I see no gain in demanding that newer buildings add more parking because my building was built with very little parking.

<TEXT> I lived in the Jefferson House for about 10 years. Only moved because owner was selling unit. I was on the top floor. Very quite. Never heard neighbors. Solid cement/brick building. Front desk was great for getting packages and the like. The building doesn't allow washer/driers in units but has laundry room. The pool is nice. Elevators are relatively new. Combination long-term residents and grad students, mostly. Never been inside the President. 

One thing regarding noise: If you have a unit in the rear, to the right (if you are standing in front of the building), the GW students in the townhouses below and sometimes in the student housing (former hotel building) at K, sometimes hold very loud and noisy parties until 2-3 a.m. Generally, this noise never bothered me, but it could be more of an issue on lower floors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll endorse that. The NPG is a gem -- and it's open to until 7 p.m. 

It's courtyard is awesome. Here, in the middle of a very busy area, is a wonderful place to sit. Free WiFi, too. I think the speeds are around 20 mps.

<TEXT> DC is top tourist attraction. It would not surprise me if some people cross DC off the their list of vacation possibilities because they'll read this stuff and say "the Smithsonian is closed!" -- 

If this leads to lost tourist dollars, that will really hurt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can do basic editing. The native tool on the machine doesn't offer much, but the apps store is loaded with some very good photo editing tools. It adds a step to upload, but generally it's a minor issue.  </TEXT>
