"The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry."

I always have that line in the back of my mind somewhere, like a song lyric or something. What are your favorites? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MISC] New Project - Author Underground: Get Paid for Poetry </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 02:29:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey /r/Poetry,

I've started a GoFundMe for a new website that will, hopefully, appeal to all the poets here. As an amateur poet myself, I thought the idea was cool, but I'm curious to see what you guys think. You all helped me out a while back with a poetry experiment for my college class, so I'm hoping I'll get some help here too!

In a nutshell, writers will submit their poetry and short stories every month. Each poem and story will receive the same amount of exposure time, and will be voted on only by users. The votes will also be restricted, so it won't become a ridiculous popularity contest where the person with the biggest Twitter following wins every month.

If you submit one of the top 2 poems of the month, you get (if funding goes well) at least $100 and you'll be entered into a yearly vote for a large annual prize.

I'm really just trying to get the word out because I think a lot of amateur writers would like this idea. Again, maybe I'm horribly off base, but I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions!

Please share or support here: http://gofundme.com/zajdng </TEXT>

Longtime lurker, first time posting here. I really want to find Bry's Q impression when he answers "I hadn't learned to walk yet!" after Walt asks about the longest he's gone without sex.

I keep seeing the quote, but with no episode listed. You'd think I'd find it after my 4 or 5 catalog re-listens.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So celebrities are allowed to use a platform that started in an attempt to allow amateurs to have a voice to do whatever they want with it, but it's pointless for "random" people to record what they find entertaining? There are all types of podcasts. Don't listen to the ones that you discredit because they don't have enough pop culture clout for you. 

And yes, we need a recording of that if those individuals want a recording of it. That's the good thing about podcasts. People can record whatever they want and people can listen to whatever they choose. I'm highly uncomfortable with the fact that a medium that began as a platforms for amateurs is now seen as a space for professionals and celebrities to further their pursuits, and now people like you say amateurs can't record what they want with their own money and resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT: This is a PS4 league

We are a very tight knit and fun league looking to add more teams. We like long walks on the beach and talking over coffee.

But seriously, we have quite a few open teams from our original fantasy draft. We just set up a DaddyLeagues page, which you can find at http://www.daddyleagues.com/RFFL to check out rosters of open teams.

One of our few rules is that GroupMe is mandatory so games can be scheduled. If you're interested, join that here  https://app.groupme.com/join_group/11854864/I9c4s2 and let us know what team you're picking!

My group and I need help with a social experiment for our Poetry for the People class. We are trying to construct a poem with various users submitting 1-2 lines. We want you to feel free to express whatever poetic style you choose, so it can be a sonnet couplet style, free verse, heroic couple, weird stream of consciousness hormonal teen style, or whatever you think of when you think "poetry"

We're looking for anywhere from 25-50 lines to create a completed poem, so we could really use the help. And if you choose to write, please come back and explain your choices in this thread!

Our professor told us that no one had ever successfully completed a social media approach, so we would love to be the first and gloat. Also, my groupmates don't believe in the power of Reddit and I would love to prove them wrong as well. So please help me force some eating of crow and thank you in advance for your help!

<TEXT> As someone with a pretty huge fear of death, I was mesmerized by this book. I was obviously horrified sometimes, what with the really stark and detailed description of the dying process. With that said, I absolutely agree that it is a must read book. Tolstoy's writing is obviously incredible, but the character does not at all reflect any sort of "carpe diem" mentality (at least from what I remember), which makes the book's themes even more appropriate.

Thanks for bringing this up because it often gets overlooked, understandably, amongst Tolstoy's other work. Also, it's a short novella, which makes it a pretty good starting point for Tolstoy's style if you're intimidated by the length of his other works. </TEXT>
