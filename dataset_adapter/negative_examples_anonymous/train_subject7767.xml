<TEXT> They can track virtually everything and even control the car on the Jeep via the 3G network.  They say (about half way down the article) that the escalade and Q50 are similarly exposed.  

I'd disable Infiniti connect if you have it until they get a fix

EDIT: Infiniti's response quoted from the article. 

 When WIRED told Infiniti that at least one of Miller and Valaseks warnings had been borne out, the company responded in a statement that its engineers look forward to the findings of this [new] study and will continue to integrate security features into our vehicles to protect against cyberattacks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was the point.  He played a sociopath.  No conscience, just do what you want to do.  

If you look closely, every time you see his bed at his apartment, it looks as if it's never been touched, only there for decoration.

He never sleeps.  He looks up stuff all day on the internet for things he's interested in, and then out all night looking for things to film. 

I thought it was pretty subtle and clever way of showing how abnormal he was beyond the actual character.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are lots of bio tech here, but there are just a lot more bio tech workers than permanent, stable jobs.  

The business seems to be leaning towards contract employers such as Lancaster that is basically a express personnel but for scientists.  They pay 40% less than the company you physically work at and that place doesn't have to worry about payroll, hr, etc.

The business is also cyclical where it goes well for a few years then lay offs galore.  

It's hard to plan things when you don't have a good sense of job security.

* I think I'll start by having some of the more benign roles in there to get people aware of how this game works.

Does anyone know a list of premade roles for around that size of games outside the ones in the rule book?  I'd like some boiler plate setups and mod it from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a group of people that want me to come in and moderate a few games of Werewolf on Wednesday.

I needs some cool ideas for game setup/roles/etc, and also tricks for moderating such a large group of people 1/2 of which I don't know.  I've only done 10-15 people at most.

I would assume table/seating arrangements are key to keep an eye on who people are indicating at night so I don't get it wrong.  Also folded paper with their names written on them so I can write  their roles down if I randomly hand out the cards.

Let me know what role make ups would be good. I would assume that we would have 2-3 games total since we only have a 2 hour window set up for a surprise gaming/birthday lunch for one of the people.

I'm assuming 1/2 of them haven't played before so I'll need a not-to-complicated game to start, then add in more interesting cards/factions in the later games.

Looking forward to the suggestions (or where to find them) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two things:

1. The richest person isn't the one who has the most, but needs the least.


2. It's only silly if it doesn't work.  I follow a modified version of this thinking and it has worked for me.  

The key is to **KNOW** that everything's going to work out.  It may not happen exactly as you planned, but everything works out.

I found the absolute perfect wife after the worst girlfriend.  I just pictured my perfect person for me, made a theoretical checklist in my head, and I KNEW she was out there.  My friends all chuckled and said "good luck with that".  6 months later we met and she added things to that list that I didn't think were possible, all in a small city.  Married 18 months later, 2 years since and this entire time we've never even had an argument.

We needed to move but wanted to buy a house in the new location.  Lots of hoops and paperwork later, we miraculously qualified for a loan and had the down payment all saved up in 3 months.  The bank wouldn't use my main income.  It's the perfect house with everything we wanted, because we KNEW that we would get it. 

The job she got that made us move and buy the house was getting shut down next year, a week after we got the keys to said house.  We KNEW that this wasn't a big deal.  We explored several options over the next 6 months.  None of those panned out.  Then a friend said to check out this free, women only, year long computer programming boot camp.  They only take 24 people, but it's worth a shot.  I read the qualification requirements and KNEW she would get in.  They had 900 people look at the program, 500 applied, 60 interviewed, and she was one of the 24 that got in. The jobs that this camp trains you for starts at 50% more that what she was getting with her biochemistry degree.

There are tons more examples that I could give that this kind of thinking works for me.  All these that I've mentioned have been in the last 3 years.

This could be a really long string of luck, but I've always seemed to get what I want.  I just know that I'll get it and it'll work out, eventually.  As such, I'm perfectly happy all the time.  What's to be mad about when you know everything will work out?  It's like a lite version of [ataraxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia)

I'm not say that nothing bad ever happens.  Shitty things happen all the time.  I've gotten sick, been hospitalized, needed surgery on a few occasions, but I knew I was going to be fine.  The difference is your perspective.  If you have a good outlook, even in the worst scenarios, things tend to work out eventually.

You also have to be proactive in doing the things you need to do to get what you want.  You can't just lie in bed and think about having buckets of money.  You do have to actually go out there and get it.  I could think about winning the lottery all day long, but I'll never win if I don't go out and buy a ticket.

In the end this can all be scientifically disproven and I've just been getting lucky over a long string of time, but this is the closest I'll ever come to any form of religion/theology.  Just like all religion, you shouldn't knock it if it's working for those that follow it and aren't hurting anyone else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> one more thing on buying the cameras.

Everywhere I've looked, it's a bunch of asian stores selling on Amazon or eBay.

I've read that these guys sell "hacked" versions of the cameras with English menus.  You can tell by the instructions and packaging that it comes in.  There have been reports of these cameras having spyware or "phone home" abilities that compromises your network allowing people to get in that you don't want to.

Where do you get the official products in the US? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right on.

Thanks for all that.  One clarification though.

I have an older i7-920 that's overclocked that I don't really use much.  I'm sure that I can get this to be the dedicated NVR without issue.  What I'm wondering is can my main desktop that I use all day for work and gaming be used for the NVR without slowing it down.  It's a i7-4770k @4.4ghz with 16GB of ram, and 5+TB of storage available.

It'd be nice to just tab over to the security software and see the live feed when needed instead of going to the other computer. </TEXT>

I don't get good WiFi signal on the outside of the house where I would want to put the cameras, so I'd have to invest in another WiFi extender.  Or I could just get a poe switch and try to run cat5 to the locations as well.

<TEXT> Hi guys, I've been looking into a simple home monitoring system.

I like what the Nest, etc. wifi cameras have to offer, but there are some big drawbacks that I don't want to deal with.

what I want is:

* Outdoor camera w/ 2 way audio ( it'll be placed under an overhang of a house, so only cold would be an issue.  I doubt it'll ever get directly wet.)
* Selective motion alerts
* **LOCAL** storage to my computer, no cloud or subscription fees
* remote access, view and control via mobile OS and web
* wifi setup and communication with my home network (to store the data on my computer).

From what I've seen, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartCam-Outdoor-SNH-E6440BN-Camera/dp/B00P1NAPPQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1436402372 sr=1-1) is the closest thing I can find, but it only has a 32GB capacity (some say it can go to a 64GB) and I'm not sure how it works for accessing the data remotely or how you archive the data without removing the SD card.  The reviews are hit and miss as well.

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

Any standard hypermileing techniques will improve the mpg.

This person that found the diamond would still have to have it cut and polished to be set in commercial jewelry.  Until that time, it'll be worth next to nothing to most people.

<TEXT> Nothing.

Diamonds have 0 intrinsic value.   There is no such thing as a used diamond.

The DeBeers company made a huge ad campaign a while back to make people think that they are rare and worth a lot of money.

They aren't rare, the supply (and therefore price) of them is controlled by one company.

Think of how many jewelry stores there are in the world.  When is the last time you saw one say, "sorry we're out of diamonds today because they are hard to come by and we didn't get any" </TEXT>

<TEXT> My car has the same scratches in the same spot.  Its from fingernails and other stuff that's on my hands.  

I bought [this](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OBCAW2?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00) and took a DC - USB power port next to the RCA inputs and connected them with a 3.5mm - RCA cable (I think it might have come with some, but I already had it).   It's 2x as loud as just the cable direct to the ports from my phone.  I had to turn up the car volume and the phone volume to the max to get good driving levels.  Now it's too loud at 50% car. 

You can probably get the curbed wheel repaired for less than $300

The only problem I've ever had was the slave cylinder failed at about 55k miles.  Normally that isn't too big of a deal, but it took out the master cylinder, the clutch and the flywheel with it.  So it was like a $4k repair.

Get that checked if it's a MT because apparently it's a known issue, but they won't do a recall on it, and WILL NOT cover the failure out of warranty.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> LiDAR and RADAR are both used by police and are picked up by good detectors.  Same principles apply.  If there is no signal to detect, it can't alert you.  If you are the only car in the lane, and a cop just powers in on briefly and only at you, the detector will go off, but it's too late. 

The false positives of detectors have gone down over the years, but it's not 100% fool proof. </TEXT>

<TEXT> meh, in the city, it's probably 6 of one 1/2 dozen of the other.  The detectors can pick up false signals, and if the cop doesn't hold the laser on, you can detect it until he pops you.  By then it's too late.

Same goes for the app.  Someone has to see the trap being setup and use the app enough to report it.  I get a lot of false positives on there.  I wonder if cops report themselves then move on just to slow down the people using Waze. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's why I'm guessing.  Nationally, traffic is going to be heavier in the afternoons no matter what.  Not everyone goes to work at the same time.  However, more people do things in the afternoons than mornings.  You errands that you have to do, the activities you want to do, etc.  So that adds more cars.

Now think of how I-5S is laid out.  We'll address it in 2 sections.  North of Northgate and South of Northgate.  

South of Northgate you have 45th, 65th, 80th, Northgate streets are basically the only places you can get on I-5S if you want to go into the city.  Plus 522 feeds into I-5 in between 80th and 65th.  So these 5 spots serve all of NE Seattle, Lake City, Greenlake, Wallingford, UW, Northgate, etc.  So more people are going to travel to the city in the evening (sporting games, nightlife, etc) and I-5 before 45th is really the only option for those people to take to get across the water.  This means there is always more people getting on I-5 than getting off until after 45th.  So the 3 lanes possible fill up to capacity very fast, causing a chain slowdown from people merging from the on ramps.  This gets worse and worse on north. 

Now think about all the people that live north of Northgate that are also going to the city (or coming home from Boeing in Everett and other places).  North of Northgate I-5 is 4 lanes + HOV lane.  At Northgate, the HOV ends and becomes I-5 Express, but that's only in the morning, so you are losing one lane.  Then the far right lane turns into an Exit Only lane, so you go from 5 to 3 lanes just south of Northgate.  So that bottleneck starts the backup from there on north.  Most days this is where the traffic really starts to crawl.  However like today, there was both a really big demand on both sections of I-5 and that's why it was slow for 10+ miles.  Remember, this happened with NO ADVERSE WEATHER OR ACCIDENTS!.  Add a wreck into that mix and you have a 2h commute from Everett to Seattle...at 3pm.

Thursday I was headed to the financial district from Lynnwood at 5pm.  My gps told me to exit i-5 at shoreline, cross over to greenwood, take greenwood to holman then holman turns into 15th and take that all the way down to elliot and take that into downtown.  It said it was 15 min faster.  I'd love to see, just as an experiment, to keep the I-5 express open southbound only all day.  Would it alleviate the SB traffic more than hinder the NB?  Like, would it cut 20 min of SB traffic, but only add 10 min to the NB? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  G37 coupes have 330 horsepower, S or no S. IPL trim will have the 348 HP engine, but with negligible (.1) increase in 0-60 mph time at best, with most magazines quoting no increase in acceleration.

I said they are 333hp.  I'm sure being 3 off isn't that wrong.

 All the Infiniti G models are based on the FM platform. Maxima is based on the FWD platform, totally different cars. 

While I'm sure you are technically correct (the best kind).  There is definitely something similar between them.  If you look at the interior of a maxima, then the interior of the sedan, you can see why I say what it's based on.  I'm not saying it uses the same chassis, but when they designed it, they said, "that worked, lets go from there".  Same thing with the coupe and a Z.  The interiors are very similar, but with an added back seat.  I'll revise my statement to say they are "inspired" by them.

 he sedan is actually lighter than the coupe by 50? or so pounds, but sedan has a slightly softer suspension. Once tuned to the same suspension and using the same wheels as the coupe (for sedan, wheels are 17 or 18 inches, while for coupe, wheels are 18 or 19 inches), the sedan will be more sporty due to its lighter weight.

Just like the 330 vs 348 hp, 50lbs isn't going to make that much of a difference.  I have driven, in a track environment, a 350z and my G37s.  I have also put thousands of miles in a G35xS sedan and a few in a 370z.   I can tell you unequivocally that sport coupe is a FAR better drivers car, which is why I recommended it over the sedan.  The sedan is a decent performance car for sure, but I wouldn't call it a drivers car.  It has mainly to do with the transmission I'd bet.  I've not seen a sedan with the 6MT, let alone driven one.  I'd like to find one and go do some laps to see if I can tell the difference.

 As for the X looking off, here's a comparison of the post-refresh G37 coupes, journey and X. Tell me that you can tell a difference between them, other than the X on the back.

Yup, sure can.  It's the wheel well arches.  The way the X sits, it looks just ever so higher than the RWD because there is more gap in the wheel wells with the factory tires.  The stance of the RWD is just right, and the x looks like it has been lifted .5-1 in.   It might be more noticeable to me since I have seen my coupe every day for years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue actually comes from the hospital's chargemaster.  It's an arbitrary list of all things that a hospital can do and how much that costs. 

THIS is where the insurance companies are starting the negotiations from.  Hospitals know this, and have been artificially inflating the prices of everything so that they get what they want from the insurance companies.  Kind of like a store marking up products a bunch just to then say, "EVERYTHING 30% OFF!!, WHAT A DEAL! FEEL FORTUNATE THAT YOU ARE GETTING SUCH A GOOD PRICE".  

This is where the hospitals claim that they are taking big losses from Medicare/Medicaid.  Because Medicare/Medicaid is paying what things SHOULD cost based on tons of research.  When the govt. is paying only 20% of what the chargemaster says, the hospital claims that they are losing money on it.  It should read that they are losing PROFIT from it.  There is still a profit margin built in to Medicare/Medicaid, but it's not what hospitals are used to. 

This is how uninsured people get double screwed.  If you don't have insurance, then you are billed what ever the chargemaster price is for that service.  A price that is by design, way too high and never intended for anyone to actually pay.

<TEXT> I couldn't bargain hunt even when I had plenty of time. 

I tweaked my knee and need minor surgery to fix it.  I didn't have insurance at the time (end of 2013).  So I went in to get a diagnostic to tell me what was needed to get it fixed.  The doctor told me what he needed to do and how to schedule it.

When I went to the station to schedule it I wanted to know how much it was going to cost.  She couldn't tell me.  She said it's going to be these 3 billing codes, plus the doctor fee, plus the anesthesiologist fee, plus the facility charge.  She had no idea, even to ball park, how much those fees would be.

I called all around and never got a straight answer about how much it was going to be.

Unless you have menu-like prices that are are easily accessed and transparent, then it's not a free market. 

All medical bills should come in a form of a "not to exceed" quote BEFORE anything happens.  That would make it more open to a "free market"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's all about what you want in a car.  Are you looking for a proper drivers car?  Get an 08+ G37S coupe 6MT.  It's 333 hp, handles like a 370Z and has options for all the luxury items (nav, backup camera, etc).

If you want a more family frendly practical car, you can get the sedan.  It's based more on the Maxima than the Z, so it doesn't handle as well, but it has a much larger trunk, 4 doors and more room in the cabin.  Same features are available on it as the coupe.

If you live where it snows, then you can get the X models of either, the only major issue for me is there is no manual transmission available with the AWD models.  On the coupes, the X looks....off.  Something about it just doesn't seem to look as good as the RWD ones.  I can spot an X a mile away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, well, it was a little different for the Mobile Managers. They were the only hourly "Manager"  We had similar responsibilities, except I didn't have keys to the store.  My $21/hr + (up to) 40% bonuses was $29.40/hr.  I was hitting bonuses most of the time, so I ended up around $55k/yr.  

The proper managers were salaried employees.  As such, they were scheduled for 11/hrs a day with 1 hour for lunch, so 50 hours a week.  When the holidays came around, they had to work 60 hours a week.  When you take their salary (around $60k) and divide it by the number of hours worked, it was around $22/hr.  These managers had bonusing potential, but in my particular store, it never happened.  It was based on the overall store numbers instead of just one department (like I did). </TEXT>

<TEXT> GS sup from 2005-2008.  Slowest computer?  I think it was a PII 450mhz.  I just sold him a new computer and transferred the little data he wanted. :

There were always hardware failures that we couldn't "Fix" because we couldn't/didn't have the parts to replace.  Most of the time if it got to that point, the labor was almost the cost of a new computer, so we just sold a new computer then.

I was lucky that at that time, there was me and one other guy with tons of experience with computers in our department.  This was before they had centralized computer repair facilities or internet based repairs.  If I couldn't figure out the issue, he could.  If he couldn't fix it, I could.  We taught the rest of the crew as best we could, but we couldn't teach things they never saw before until it was presented to them.  Not a lot of substitution for experience in the tech world.  Especially when you are dealing with the massive variability in customers computers.

Now-a-days, everything is just a google away.  But pre Vista, knowing DOS commands and how to mount OS' from CD to clean up system file hijacking processes weren't taught to GS, you had to know. </TEXT>

The supervisor at the time was caught by a female returns employee going through a computer and had opened up some porn on the computer.

<TEXT> Turn over is an issue with all retail employees.  They don't pay amazing when you are just a sales guy, but if you can get into middle management, then it's a decent living.  Getting there is tough though.  Most of the sales staff are kids going to school or didn't finish school so this is the best job they can get.  Once out of college, they go and get a real job.

As far as the sales staff, they have online based training that they have to go through.  However, it's mostly process based (how to clock in, how to order something for a customer, how to run the register) then they get a separate section of training that is specific to their department.  It's not updated as often as the technology changes, so keeping up with the new things that come in, why they are good, and who would benefit from them is learned day to day from other, more experienced people.  The really good sales people have a passion for the stuff they are selling and have done the research on their own time before it shows up and are excited to see it/play with it.

You must have talked with the former instead of the latter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Overpriced and unnecessary services" to you perhaps.

The price of the complete solution in one stop is worth more than scrounging around the internet looking for the best deal on whatever it is I want.  You don't sell out of your own pocket.  If I came in to buy an entire home theater, you best sell me everything I need so I don't have to come back or worry about the installation.

The services are even more valuable to those without the skill set to do it themselves.  I've purchased around $50000 worth of stuff from Best Buy in the last 10 years and I'll get the service plans on the big items, especially the damage (ADH) ones.  I've only not used it about 20% of the time.  80% of the time I've utilized the PSP/ADH and got my money's worth at least and came out ahead more often than not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 2005-2008 they had the "Advanced Diagnostic and Repair".  It was $199.  EVERY computer that wouldn't turn on or we couldn't figure out/fix in 5 min was sold this.  If it didn't make it past the initial diagnostics (like bad HDD), the $199 was refunded/applied to a new computer - the $59 diagnostic.  

They measured how many ADRs, diags, hardware installs along with your average turn around time.  You wanted high ADRs, low diags and low turn time.

PSP's weren't really measured at GS directly because if you were in the computer section, you were absolutely supposed to offer them, but it went to the computer dept numbers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The starting pay depends on your area.  Best Buy has pay grades assigned to every position and a national average range for each grade.  A Geek Squad counter agent was grade 5.  Then it factors to your location.  Bend, OR was +10% of average.  Lynnwood, Wa was +25% (the highest possible).  So if the grade 5 position was $11/hr average, then the WA store would start at $13.75.

I started at $13.50 because I asked for $15 back in 2005.  I got to $21 + bonuses (ended up ~$55k/yr) when I was a BBYM manager.  So it wasn't terrible money, but it didn't make me rich. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a guy that was training me at Geek Squad.  We were opening a new store so the Senior tech from the closest city came in to train all of us.  There were like 6 of us.

For 2 days he had been showing us where the customer file folders were going for each stage of repair and record keeping.  Since Geek Squad takes a page out of NASA, the folders were called dossiers. 

For 2 days he kept saying, "You take the customer's paperwork, and you put it in the dozer."  Remember, he was the top guy at this other store, so I'm not sure how long he'd worked there, with who knows how many other people.  No one had corrected him.   I finally had to stop and correct him when I couldn't take it any more.

<TEXT> It depends on how you wash them.  If you pour liquid detergent directly on them while in an older, non front loading unit, then you will see "stains" of glowing sections of where you poured it.  If you use liquid soap on a modern unit, all the jeans will glow just a little bit.  I don't think it works with powdered soap.

I remember going to a club after just washing my jeans in the old style washer and it looked like I had a massive cum stain all down the front of my pants under the black light.  Never poured the soap in last again. </TEXT>

When I got to my friends house, I thought he was messing with me when he said, "I thought you said you hit something?".  I get out.  The only damage was a missing sideview mirror, a smashed corner of the windshield, and a scrape on the passenger window.  That's it.

I had managed to time it just so that he jumped, stuck his neck out and his head (it had small horns) hit the window and his neck hit the A pillar. That spun him around taking out the mirror and a hoof caught the window just barely.  It was only a few hundred is repairs. </TEXT>

It still has the factory everything and the amp for this is under the spare panel on the opposite side of the sub.  This worked well because the optimum space for that 10" is .5 cu ft.  So they fiberglassed it to fit the little nook behind the wheel well arch which was just about that space.  

It looks like it came from the factory and still have use of my trunk.  It sounds really good. Not over bearing. 

Since you have the sedan, you have a lot more room to work with, but if you still want use of the trunk, this might be a good starting point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My factory charging cable was DOA, so the VZW store gave me a 3rd party one.  This one has a little LED that lights up when you hold it and goes off when you are either charging or not touching it.  After a few days, the light will stay on all day every day, and then after a few more days, the connector got to 135 degrees.  I  swapped it out for another one and it is doing the same thing, but not getting too hot yet.  

I think the turbo charger is breaking this aftermarket cord.  I've ordered some longer non-lit ones and hopefully it's going to be ok. </TEXT>

Good site.  So here's my issue.  I travel for work, so I'm all over the states that I cover.  Sometimes these locations are out in the middle of nowhere and I need to be able to pull up their info from salesforce.com or call them to make sure we are still on or have to change the times we are scheduled to meet.

If I only lived and worked in the bigger city ( Seattle...Where T-Mobile's HQ is, Tri cities, Spokane)  Then it would be a non issue since they are mostly the same.

http://puu.sh/hWZa1/d288744fcf.jpg - Verizon 3g/4g coverage

http://puu.sh/hWZfE/4f575d052e.jpg - TMO 3g/4g

http://puu.sh/hWZhm/4bd0419c6f.jpg - Sprint. 

If you look at all the little pockets of places where VZW has decent 3G/4G coverage, it's clear that there is way better coverage in way more places in WA.  It's even more apparent in Oregon.

If you zoom out a bit more, it's laughable. 

http://puu.sh/hWZEn/181dd5fcbe.jpg --TMO
http://puu.sh/hWZGS/e7252bc5fe.jpg --VZW.

I would love to stop over paying VZW, but where I go, coverage is king. </TEXT>

I remember going to the international auto show a few years back and both BMW and Hyundai had matte paint jobs on their display cars.  They were roped off and you weren't even allowed to touch them.

Looks cool, but I wouldn't want to deal with the day to day of matte. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was looking in to an Anytime Fitness Franchise. 

Everything in the contract stated that I had to pay no matter what happened.  Even if they do things to hurt my membership numbers.  Similar to Quizno's, they could have upped the rates of all the equipment used to run the place at anytime and there was nothing I could do about it.  They control the entire process.

They also wanted an unlimited personal guarantee. They wouldn't budge on this.  They wanted to be able to take EVERYTHING I HAD, unlimitedly, in order to get what the contract stated.  On top of that I had to sign another similar deal for the lease of the building.

In the end it would have cost over 1 million in startup and fees over 5 years, and I wouldn't have anything to show for it because I really didn't own anything. I was leasing everything.

I could see if you had the money to startup 6 of them in decent areas, you could make a pretty penny, but it wasn't right for where I was at at that time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came in to Seatac very late last night and I found a high end smartphone sitting on a bench while waiting for the shuttle to pick me up.

The battery was dead, so I charged it up and turned it on, but it had a lock pattern, no emergency contacts and the SIM card was already cancelled.  I went to a local store that matched the carrier and they said that the person was from Houston. I left it with them, so they can contact the owner.

**TL:DR  If you are/were visiting Seattle in the last day or so and lost your phone, it's at the carrier store at the mall in Lynnwood, Wa.**

Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I bet that the CEO would blow $500 on a single dinner.

In drinks alone.

I am willing to bet that if you were 5 minutes late(measured by a machine) that some asshole manager shit on you and put you on probation.

At Best Buy, that was the one thing people got fired for like 90% of the time.  Easiest way to get rid of problem workers, and an easy way for middle management to show upper management that they were actually doing something.

In a more serious note, there might be something to the "entitlement generation" but I see it more as a generation that was told "you need to go to college so you don't have to have a laborers job.  Those jobs are for losers"  

I'm in the 1978-1997 generation and that's all I was told by my parents, my friends were told the same thing.  Now we are the same people that have over $1 Trillion in college debt with blue collar workers aging and declining.  Someone with a masters degree in education might make $40k a year and have 6 years of school to pay for, while someone that was an apprentice electrician for the same time could make twice that after reaching journeyman with no debt.  But we sure as hell weren't given that as an option.

  THAT is the actual result of this "entitlement generation" </TEXT>

Kids will be kids, but when they do it IN FRONT OF YOU, you should do your fucking job as a parent and teach them to respect property that isn't yours.  

How is this a hard thing to grasp? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had thought about that but there wasn't any really good documentation I could find on how project Fi works software wise.  The FAQ says 
 If you're not using your Nexus 6 and you've opted-in to use your number to talk and text on other devices, you can make calls over Wi-Fi using your number through Google Hangouts.

So this might be an issue people run into that want Project Fi but don't have a Nexus 6.

I have the app, but no invite, so I can't test it out to see what that app actually does and how it's different from Hangouts or the regular dialer. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Google Hangouts/Wifi Calling uses as much battery as screen? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-05 02:12:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In preparation for the Project Fi, I wanted to see what it'll be like using Google Hangouts as VoLTE or Wifi calling. 

Today I took the phone off the charger at 11am and had to take a 2+ hour conference call.  I called in to the number with the Hangouts app, then joined the meeting and had the screen on most of the time as I needed to mute/unmute when needed. 

I had expected the screen to suck down the battery pretty bad, but when I was done with the call, I looked and I had 50% battery left.  I go in to the battery stats and the screen and the hangouts app both had the same amount of battery useage at about 16% each.  Under the hangout app, it said it had 2+ hours of CPU usage time.

I'm pretty sure if I had used the normal dialer for this call, it wouldn't have used near what the hangouts app did.  I was on my home Wifi at the time, not LTE.  The phone is the Verizon branded version and the rom is stock, but rooted.

Is this something that anyone else has experienced?  I've tried searching around and nothing has specifically described this issue.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup.  Under the main heading you could see the upvotes in orange, and downvotes in blue.  The sum would be the number we still have.

Remember reddit puts automatic downvotes on threads over time to allow new ones to come up.

So a thread that had 3000 net upvotes would show like 15000 upvotes and 12000 downvotes .  I'm sure in most cases there weren't actually that many real downvotes, just a small portion and the rest were added by the algorithm

To seal the deal to get new members they can waive "activation fees" or discount the "key fee".  Both of those have very little costs so it's easy to waive it to get someone to pay $45-$50/mo.

<TEXT> oh yeah, for sure. The part where he "measures" the force of the bike with the crane gauge?  The rope had some slack in it and when he popped the clutch, the rope snapped to tension resulting in WAY more force than when he slowly got the rope taught for the guy then slowly applied the throttle.   I'm sure it takes a lot of strength to hold back a motocycle, but it wasn't 1300 lbs of force.

but their explanation for his ability to do the things he does makes the most plausible sense.  Especially since the supposedly do that for a living. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was stating that girls like this DO EXIST.  Attractive, smart, stable and like games/anime.  Might be 1 in 100,000,000, but they are out there.  As the gaming/geek culture gets more mainstream and girls are exposed to and not shamed for liking that culture the odds will get better and better.

<TEXT> Force = Mass * Acceleration.  They measured his muscle fiber output and apparently he can activate more fibers that a normal person.  So when he activates all of them at once, he can accelerate his hands at a faster rate, therefore producing a higher force.

He was on an episode of "Stan Lee's Superhumans" where they hooked him up to a computer to measure his output.  It was off the scale their first attempt. 

*EDIT*  It's on Netflix, the first episode, his section starts at 33 min.  They replicate the force to see how much weight it would take to bend a wrench like that and it's over 500 pounds of static force. </TEXT>

Id probably buy a used G35 and run it until the engine needs replacing.

That will be FOREVER.  These engines don't really die as long as you take care of it.

I'd love to see a G35 sedan with an LS1, but that would cost at least 3x as much as you paid for the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I think the adaptable cruise control and lane assist are pretty cool, but pretty useless for any 1/2 competent driver, so not really worth the money.  They wont help if someone is dumb and smashes in to you.

As far as advanced driving skills go, it's hard to explain in short order.  The main thing is to be smooth.  Smooth driving is fast driving.  I've been self studying these tactics 30+ years with no official training.  I did attend one of these schools that I mentioned back in 2006 and they said they couldn't teach me anything more than what I already knew.  I was passing corvette Z06's in a 350z, I out run most Porsches (non turbo) around tracks in my G37 (until the oil cooler can't handle it and gimps the RPMs).  Of course if they had drivers similar to me, they'd walk away no problem.  I am no pro, but I'm better than most people on the road.  I placed in the top 1% of people in [GT academy](http://www.gran-turismo.com/us/academy/about/)

It's a lot of theory and understanding the physics of what is happening during every second the car is moving.  Understanding things like what a [contact patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_patch) is and how [weight transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_transfer) affects it.  No matter what road I'm on I'm always am looking for the proper [driving line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_line) and also figuring out where the optimal [braking zone](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/braking.htm) is.  If you are on a wet road and start to [oversteer](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/oversteer.htm) you need to know how to recover safely (RWD mostly, but they can [understeer](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/understeer.htm) too.)

If you understand these basics, you can drive any car fast once you get the feel how the car performs.  Then you can drive that same car at a normal speed, but have the skills to get you out of any mess you or someone else puts you in.

Check out that www.drivingfast.net  That seems to describe the basics pretty well.  If you can find a closed parking lot or private road(track) to practice on, that would be best.

Once you get into it, you might discover that you have a little of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and realize you didn't know how much you really don't know about driving. 

A licence just proves you know the rules of the road and can operate the basics of a car.  It doesn't mean you can actually *drive*

<TEXT> well, first off, do you want a manual or auto?  That'll eliminate a few options right there (no manual and AWD)

Also, if you've only been driving on public streets since January, this will be a lot of car for you (300+hp).  There are lots of electronic counter measures that will help keep you on the road, but that doesn't keep you 100% safe.

Am I reading right that you are in Mexico?  No idea what's available as far as driver training, but in the states we have advanced driving courses that teach you racing mechanics and skills that will translate well to emergency maneuvers when needed, but it requires practice to be able to feel what the car is doing or is going to do and adjust accordingly.  They can be pricey ($500/day) but if you love to drive it's worth every penny (peso?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's less about the tech of the router and more about their little xfinity system that they sell.

They have one master box that is connected to the modem.  Then if you have slave boxes where other tv's are, those act as repeaters for the wifi.  So when they claim the fastest "in home wifi", it's due to having a very strong wifi signal that allows you to get the most speed that the modem is providing anywhere in the house (or outside).  

You can have a 10Gbps connection right to your house, and a 802.11AC router sitting right next to it.  But if it's like my house and in a closet in a corner of the house, it doesn't have a strong wifi connection in most areas of the house.  So you'll be lucky to get 5-10% of what the modem can do.  </TEXT>

T-Mobile claimed the fastest LTE, and they were also right because it was averaging like 30mbps, but only in like 4 cities at the time.

It's all about how you spin it.  So when you see all these claims that each one of them makes, it seems like they all make the same claim and it gets jumbled when you try to remember it later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The GTR can corner.

I'd love to see a pro driver take a Hellcat on Laguna Seca and then the GTR.  I bet there is more than 2 second lap times faster in the GTR.

EDIT [it's over 6 seconds a lap faster than the Hellcat at Willowsprings](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/willow_springs_-_streets_of_willow.html) and it's only 2.5 seconds faster than a GTi that has almost 500hp less.

The Hellcat is a muscle car and a damn fine one, not a supercar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seattle is looking at SF as what things may come.  TONS of tech job openings that pay 60-100k/yr.  That's easily liveable money in Seattle.  People are coming in droves to work at Amazon, Google, HBO, ADT, Starbucks, Zillow, Redfin, Adobe, Expedia, M$, Nintendo, Pokemon, Nordstrom, and countless startups.  They are buying up/renting out all the apt's near downtown to minimize the shitty commutes forcing out all the artsy folks that are barely making money as is.

It's creating a pretty big divide between the people that have been there for decades and these new transplants.

Not sure how to stop it from following suit other than I'm happy I live where I live. </TEXT>

<TEXT> at least they have plenty of room to build and cheap property to do it.

SF really has no where to grow but up.  Until then, it's going to be more and more expensive. 

If I wanted to buy the same house I have have now in SF (brand new construction, 4bd 3.25 bath, 2500 sqft) it would cost 2-4 times more than what I paid, and it would have been built in the 1920s.  Thats 4-8 times more than the house I had before with similar specs.

Both me and my wife would need to both be making 6 figures to live the way we do now. </TEXT>

I was one of the top three sales guys in Oregon around 2002.  I would make $650-$800/wk in commissions plus minimum wage (which basically took care of taxes).  In today's dollars that would be $65-$70k/yr slinging electronics. I'd be interested to hear how much people are making today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In almost all cases, it's cheaper to repair than to buy again.  However, it could be a money pit if you fix one thing, then that makes some other part fail, then you fix that....

Could be a cascading effect, but that's usually on like 25+ year old cars, not 10. 

I prefer the coupes over sedans because it feels closer to a 350z than a nicer maxima. 

If you have a rebuilt/repaired car, you can forget about recouping your $ in resale value.  It'll not be worth as much.

<TEXT> Which ever one you pick, have a franchise lawyer look over the FDD.  I was going to buy an anytime fitness franchise.  I had a great spot and decent lease pricing picked out.  Then I had a lawyer look at it and gave me some good questions to ask.  He also spelled out in plain terms how they will always get their fees even if the business goes under, even if it's through no fault of my own.  There was language in it that said they could put me out of business if certain things happened.  They had no obligation to do anything for me after the doors opened.

A big pitfall for food franchises is that they control who you buy your supplies from...because they own those distribution channels.   If they raise the price of food, then you can't go elsewhere to get a more competitive rate.

Anytime fitness is the same way.  They own the payment processor you use, the security and monitoring equipment companies, the back end software, everything but the actual fitness equipment. If they decide they want more money, there is nothing you can do about it.  And this is coming from the #1 franchise to own right now.

There are stats (I don't have right now) that say that there is only a 1% difference in being successful between a business that is independent and a franchise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know in the FAQ there are some links to general answers to these questions, but I'm looking for a particular viewpoint.

My wife has made it to the 2nd round of candidates for an academy that is targeting technically minded women. They take women with little to no experience in web development, and giving them a intensive 7 month course + 5 month internship at local (Seattle) tech companies to be a full stack developer for free.

I'd like to hear more about the industry (local Seattle would be best) to know what she would be getting into? Things like, pay, workload, expected hours/week, ability to still have a personal life/vacations, what kind of corporate BS (I know it's in every industry) you have to wade through, industry specific challenges (outside of actual project challenges), etc. A womans perspective would be ideal.
Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife has made it to the 2nd round of candidates for an academy that is targeting technically minded women.  They take women with little to no experience in web development, and giving them a intensive 7 month course + 5 month internship at local (Seattle) tech companies to be a full stack developer for free.

I'd like to hear more about the industry (local Seattle would be best) to know what she would be getting into?  Things like, pay, workload, expected hours/week, ability to still have a personal life/vacations, what kind of corporate BS (I know it's in every industry) you have to wade through, industry specific challenges (outside of actual project challenges), etc.   A womans perspective would be ideal.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been waiting for Verizon to release this phone to get it for $200 instead of $650.  I went to look at one at the AT T store.  
It had some nasty burn  in.  I know it's been there on full brightness for 12+ hours a day for months.  Anyone seen this in real world usage?

Also, What is missing from the this phone? The one thing I really like about my wife's Moto X (2013) is the Moto Assist app. The nexus is a Moto phone, so does have or can it get this app?

I'll be coming from a Note 3 (Galaxy Nexus before that) so I'm looking forward to the bigger size, Android 5.1, and similar battery life (I get 3-4 hours of SOT now).

I know people are raving about other kernels and ROMs but I'll look for just basic root and apps that utilize that well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can get vented rotors that help with brake fade.  That's the cheapest option. http://www.stillen.com/products/brake-rotors/

You can get "big brake kits" that up the rotor size and caliper piston #.  http://www.stillen.com/products/brake-kits/?varyear=2007 varmake=Infiniti varmodel=G35

Just depends on how big you want to go.  If you do track racing regularly, then you would see a real benefit with the big kits.  Otherwise just the rotors might help a little with "spirited" driving day to day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bigger brakes maybe?  Doesn't matter how fast you can go if you can't stop quickly.

If you don't want to go real big HP (supercharging/turbo), then consider an Uprev tune?  Should be able to squeeze more HP out of the current mods and give you a little better throttle response.  I'd only do this after you are done with engine/hp mods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The infinite thickness for gold is 10 microns. Gold plating is usually thinner than that. So our unit can see the underlying metal and give you a warning.  Even reaching the limit, it looks at the ratio between the M and L shell kEV cps and can also give you a warning.

Super engineered counterfeits can fool XRF for sure, but those are rare and costly to make.  What people are doing is getting stainless steel (austenitic aka doesn't respond to magnets), stamping them 18k and then going place to place to see if someone will buy it as white gold.  Stainless steel will pass the 18k scratch acid test, but it instantly shown on XRF to have no gold.  Same with grandma's jewelry.  People will swear up and down that this is a pure 18k gold ring that has been passed down for generations, but the XRF will spot regular plating and costume jewelry in 5 seconds or less.

XRF also helps you pay for exactly what you get when it is authentic.  14k gold should be 58.5% gold.  However, most of the stuff made in recent years is 55% gold.  So if your item passes the 14k scratch test, and you are paying out on 58.5% by weight, then you are losing money when you go to sell it to the foundry who will do an fire assay and get the correct %.

Most big pawn/coin shops will have an XRF unit.  Hardcore Pawn has 2 of ours that they use on the show occasionally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> construction, plumbing, welding...any blue collar field, etc

Women can certainly do those jobs, but they tend to be much more physically demanding.  The average man can do those jobs and get worn out pretty easily after a day of work in training.  The average woman will have a far tougher time accomplishing the same job.

Not sure what best describes this, "free market" maybe?  Of all the blue collar jobs, I would think electricians would be best for both sexes.  Lifting some wire bundles and running up and down ladders should be just as easy for both. Unlike normal construction/framing.  That's a lot of weight you are always moving around.

My father built houses all his life.  He's so strong (even at 72) that he is faster on his own than most 2 man crews.  That Y chromosome comes in handy once in a while.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are forced induction.  So they force more air into the engine.  If you can get more air in there, you can get more fuel (air to fuel ratio, or stoichiometry, says when the mix will ignite) .  More fuel = bigger bang.  Bigger bang = more power pushing the cylinder down.

Now how they function it's different between sc and turbo.  Turbo's use the exhaust to spin a turbine on one half of it, when then sucks more air in on the other side.

Super chargers use the belts of the engine to drive the turbine (or other type).  Supercharged cars usually have no delay or lag between when you hit the has pedal, while turbo suffer from turbo lag from them taking some time to spool up to pressure.

You rarely see supercharged 4 cylinder cars, but 6+ cylinder can go either way.

<TEXT> Back when game distribution wasn't that good, you had to pre-order games in order to ensure that when it came out, you could actually get a copy.  Now you can get virtually every new release in a digital download format, therefore there is an unlimited supply of games.

So, with that being said there is actually 0 reason to pre order a game.  Games will go on sale after they are released.  all pre orders do now is just give game companies money for stuff they haven't done yet.  They know they can just rush games out, un polished, buggy, and patch it up later if need be.  But they don't need to do that, because they'll just work on the next half baked big IP game and shovel in more money from those pre orders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stillen Gen 3 will get you the most HP/$ for sure.

I like the sound of the [Stillen Exhaust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw41sSRZ4mU) as well. 

Both of those combined should give you a 30+hp boost for about $2k total.

If you go big, then you can go with a supercharger or Twin turbo kit, but those can be upwards of $10k and get you to 500+ hp at the crank </TEXT>

They say they are working on it, but damn, they've been out for a year and nothing.

I'm sure they've done all they can, but Sony isn't letting them have the rights to it for some reason.  </TEXT>

So when people brought their cans and bottles in to recycle, I would take them to the back, cut off all the points (they were on the outside labels plastic bottles and on the cardboard cases of cans) and keep them, then sort them where they needed to go.

I had THOUSANDS of points at the end of the summer and got SO much crap most of it was pretty decent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a difference between a Skyline, and a Skyline GT-R (R3x).  I don't think they make a Skyline GT-R since the new platform in 2003.  It's just Skyline 350GT (G35) or the GT-R (R35).

If the kid has GT-R badges, then that's stupid.  If he swapped Infiniti for Skyline...there's nothing wrong with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technically it IS a Skyline, but it's not an R35 by any means. Just because it was "imported" doesn't make it any better (even if it were true).  If I had a 280hp car in High school, i'd feel pretty damn proud of it too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did the same thing at Best Buy.  I was a hourly department manager (not a supervisor, only one in the store) and there were 4-5 Assistant store managers.  

I was making $21/hr + up to 40% bonuses.  They were flat 55-60k/yr + x% bonuses.

They weren't making their numbers to get bonuses, working 50hrs a week (60 for the holidays) and I was at 40 hrs/wk hitting max bonus numbers and had OT when I needed to work more.

After I left, one of the AM's "demoted" herself to my spot.  Same money, less work load. </TEXT>

Just because you have a license doesn't mean you know how to drive.  It just means you demonstrated understanding of the rules of the road and basic operation of a vehicle.  

Driving takes a lot more knowledge about what the car is doing at any given moment.  What is the contact patch of the tires during this turn?  When I apply the brakes, how does the transfer of weight affect the balance of the car? Etc... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stillen Cat-Back Exhaust First Impressions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-12 08:40:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I ordered the kit on their black friday week specials for $1240 and it arrived today.

It came in 2 separate boxes weighing a total of about 100lbs. It comes in 6 pieces + the hardware.  Tools you need are a 14mm socket, 14mm wrench, 12mm socket, lots of penetrating spray lube, and that's it.  

The instructions are pretty basic and not TOO descriptive but it wasn't hard to figure out what they were talking about.

The most difficult part of the whole job is removing the factory exhaust.  I just jacked up the rear my car on jack stands and went to work.  The factory exhaust is 3 pieces.  The muffler, the resonators, and the y-pipe.  It's held on by 10 bolts and 5 rubber hangers.  

In my case, the bolts that attached the y-pipe to the resonators were frozen/jammed on there good, I was able to break one loose, but ended up stripping the nut of the 2nd.  Not that big of a deal as you can remove the cross member that is right there and the whole thing came out as one big piece (y-pipe+resonators).  Getting the hangers out of the rubber supports was a bear as well.  They have an arrow tip that makes it really hard for them to go back out after they have been installed. You have to pull on the rubber while at the same time push on the mufflers (and a lot of lube) to finally get them out.  This would have been massively easier if I had it on a lift and not awkwardly squirming on the ground trying to get leverage.

Installing the new parts was super simple.  First put the larger part of the y-pipe on, then the other and secure the bolts finger tight using the factory gasket and bolts.  Then hang the resonators in their spots and bolt it to the y-pipe with the gasket and supplied hardware, again finger tight.  After that, you hang the mufflers in their spots (kinda of a bitch by yourself working from the ground). Last bolt the tubes from the muffler to the resonators with the last 2 gaskets.   From the cats start tightening everything down working your way back checking for clearance of the sway bar and cross member (that you reinstalled if you took it off).  Once the exhaust tips are aligned properly (by sliding the hangers back or forward), you can make sure everything is bolted down tight.  Start the car, check for leaks.

For my car, it was about a 3.5/10 difficulty.  If I had a lift it would have been a 2/10....with a helper and a lift, 1/10.  From unboxing to taking the car off the stands and cleaning up was about 3 hours.  I spent too long on that one bolt and I kept getting work phone calls, so it could have been 2-2.5 hours.

The increase in performance seemed noticeable.  I'm sure I'll use the extra "19 rwhp" claimed by Stillen, but it's the sound that makes it worth all the while.

During initial startup and under load, it sounds mean...but not obnoxious, very similar to the stock sound (which I loved).  On the road, it's actually QUIETER than stock.  Anyone that complains of a "drone" is hallucinating.  I took a trip down the freshly paved freeway near my house last week with the stock exhaust and tonight with the Stillen exhaust.  I also took with me a dB meter.  Stock exhaust was around 67-75db at highway speeds.  Stillen was 63-70db.  I was really surprised.  Perhaps after a few hundred miles it might change as it gets broken in, but we'll just have to wait and see.

I'll post a vid of the exhaust under load compared to stock after it stops this wind/rain shit storm that Seattle has going right now.

**tl;dr  Stillen exhaust is super easy to install, more power, and a mature sound that wont piss off your whole neighborhood.**

<TEXT> I have a GoPro with lots of mounts and will be doing some before/after video's.  

What would you like to see?

I'll probably just drive a 1-2 mile route around my neighborhood with the camera stuck just above the exhaust, then again in the cabin.  After the new exhaust is on, repeat it. 

I might also do a time lapse of the install process, it doesn't look all that difficult.

I've done nothing but baby this thing since I got it a week ago.  Never attempted to replace the band. If it's off my wrist, it's on the charger.  

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I moved to Seattle recently and was looking forward to going to PAX Prime, but missed out getting any tickets.  

I thought the face value of these were like $35 each, so I'm not sure why all of them are advertised for $80+ ea.  If someone could explain that to me, that would help.  Unless it's just people taking advantage of others, then...well, people suck.

Anyway, I'd love to go just for a day to see it.  Any day would be ok, but if there are 2 Sat or Sun passes available at a reasonable price so that both my wife and I can go, I'd be forever grateful.  

If you are here in the Seattle area, that would be best, otherwise I guess shipping will have to do. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What would happen if the minimum income was set at $30,000/yr </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-19 15:37:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Fun Fact. If the top 30% of Americans (anyone making ~$47k+ a year) donated just over 25% of their income, the minimum wage could be set at $30000 a year. Now that would be nearly 100% increase in $ for 40% of the people in the country (around 60 MILLION people). What would the economy look like if almost half the people had twice the money they had before?

If you make less that $20k/yr now, what would YOU do with $10K+ more money at the job you currently have? Buy more things than you would right now probably. Perhaps start investing in things? Start owning a home? Trade in that old inefficient unsafe car? Start eating better food and going to the gym? Stop going to the dollar store/Wal-Mart and start spending money at local shops and on things that were made in the USA because now you don't have to save every penny? I would think that far more business ventures would be more successful because more people would have more money to spend on things that aren't necessities.

I know that people will screen "socialism!" and "redistribution of wealth to the lazy!" and what not, but it's just a thought experiment. Since 1% of the people have 40% of the wealth in this country, what would happen if we DID take half of that money that the 1% has and gave it to the bottom 40% (The bottom 80% only have 7% of the wealth currently). Think about it. 

A CEO makes ~380x more than the average employee (not the least paid...the average). The average person has 1 car, if that. CEO's don't have 380 cars each, or even a few cars that combined are worth 380x the average. It gets to a point to where you can only buy so much stuff. Sure it can be lavish, expensive and superlative..but if you make 1000 times more that the average person, you wont spend 1000 times more money on things. In 2012, 3000 people made AT LEAST 1000 times more than 60,000,000 people did, with 1000 of those making over 5000 times more.

Forget about if it is "fair" or not. Just what if the rich suddenly decided to willingly give up a decent portion of their immense wealth for the good of the country.
