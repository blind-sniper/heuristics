<TITLE> The Old Man </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-13 23:35:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My husband's uncle lives next door. 
He just got out of an old folks home.
They found a tumor in his brain and 
thankfully were able to remove it and
 he is OK now but having symptoms of dementia/Alzheimer's.  


So one day I was sleeping. My husband was at work. Suddenly I wake up. There's someone at the window trying to open it. I freak out, looking for my phone to call the cops.  One of our cats moves the curtains and I can see an old man with a walker and hunched back. OK. It's uncle Andy. I run to the bathroom (got the pee almost scared out of me) and call my husband.   

Apparently his uncle wanted to talk to him. He doesn't have a watch or phone or sense of time so he just keeps randomly showing up in our window.  The second time I had just gotten out of the bath and was completely naked. I yelled for my husband, grabbed a nightgown and again, ran to the bathroom, this time to get dressed.  

My husband finally went over to visit him and I guess he keeps saying the same thing and asking the same questions over and over again. He thinks his caretaker and nurse are out to get him.  Apparently he's been deliberately peeing and pooping on the bed to scare the nurse away?  In his old man brain somehow it makes sense.  

Anyway, other than the window visits which scare me every damned time, he's started throwing notes on our porch.  The notes are getting progressively weirder.  

I'll try my best to decipher them.

Christopher please remember
" I'm a lost dog please help me to get home don't hit or beat me."

Thanks  A.V.

Screw him
2,3,4 times

Don't trust Sherrie and Shirley (caretakers) both have screwed me 2x.











2)

Chris
Please give me another small notebook this size. 
Will I ever get out of here alive?  When?
How?  Jingles run through my head.
"I'm a little dog. Don't hit or beat me. I'm trying to get home. Please help me." 

Don't trust Ross or Whartons. All liars.

<TEXT> I get paid tomorrow.  Somehow I got charged two days early for a $15 recurring payment.  So I am currently at a $-15 account balance.  Last night I had to go to the ER at 3 am due to severe back and ovary pain.  I then had to go back to the hospital to get an ultrasound.  My husband and I both get paid tomorrow. We have no gas, no cigarettes, and no food until grocery shopping tomorrow.  My pain medication is wearing off and I have to wait two days to get my test results. Tomorrow I have to go to work because I already missed half a day this week and half a day last week because of constant sharp back pain.  Today has been one big bowl of shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have seasonal affective disorder, it's very bleak in winter and I get horribly depressed. It's finally spring so I have been sunning myself in moderation with adequate sunscreen on. In the winter months I have a UV light that helps, especially when it's dark out when I go to work and dark when I come back home, sometimes it feels like I never see the sun. I live in Pennsylvania but ideally would prefer to live in Florida or the southwest where it is usually 60 degrees year round. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Leave cat food out regularly. Eventually he will get used to your presence and let you get closer to him. Assuming he is not feral he will start to trust you and eventually let you pet him.  I have had several neighborhood cats decide to "move in" in this fashion.

<TEXT> My husband does stuff around the house. I didn't have a problem cleaning when I was unemployed, but he has always done all the cooking so I  have always cleaned up after dinner and washed dishes. I figured that was fair 50/50. 

But recently I have started working, so since I am cleaning all day at work, I don't really want to clean when I get home, too. So he will usually wash dishes and do cat litter and make the bed on the days I work, and I will do it on my days off as well as catch up on doing any other general house cleaning that needs done (vacuuming, mopping, laundry, cleaning the bathroom)


ALSO just wanted to add that sometimes I have to rewash the dishes since he doesn't always wash the bottom of plates or get all the grease off, etc. so you are not alone. lol

I don't think it's unrealistic to expect men to do their fair share. If they were living alone they would have to do it anyway. Also if  their wife/girlfriend is sick or just had surgery, they should know how to do it.  I just had surgery and couldn't do anything for two weeks. 
If it was up to him he would probably let stuff pile up but I am slightly ocd when it comes to cleaning standards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I straight up told my ex-boyfriend that bdsm was important to me. If he wanted to try it, good. If not, well I will probably end up leaving you for someone who will.

It was heartless for me to say but I was being 100% honest.
I did end up leaving him for someone else, but it was years down the road.  

In my mind, sex isn't the most important thing in a relationship, but it is important.  Not only was the sex bad but we had other problems as well. So it would be simplistic to say that I left him because of sex and the lack of kink.  But he could have at least had enough consideration to try.

It's not like I wanted to tie him up and use a strap on with him, but a little role playing isn't too much to ask, right? lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your mentality disgusts me. What if this was your daughter? Wife? Mother?  Yes, meeting strangers off the internet can be dangerous. I'm sure she has "learned her lesson". 

If the rapist truly knew what the fuck he was doing he would have made her sign a contract. While she may have agreed to having sex involving rape play, she did not consent to being held prisoner for three days. She did not consent to being anally raped. BOTH people were not going about this the correct way. A detailed discussion of hard limits should have been conducted beforehand and a safeword so that when he crossed the line she would at least have the opportunity to signal her distress. Whether that would have stopped him or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> most rape victims tend to have a guilt complex. media tends to have a "she was asking for it" by dressing that way, drinking, being alone with men, etc mentality and at some point it's self-internalized.

<TEXT> As someone who has had rape fantasies, and someone who has actually been raped, I would just like to add that the fantasy of rape is completely different from actual rape.  This could have easily have happened to me and I feel for your friend.  Obviously she trusted this guy to NOT go overboard and he took advantage of her.  Even in a bdsm type scenario, there would be safewords and someone experienced would be able to tell true distress signals from "oh no please don't (stop)".  There would probably even be check ins from time to time to make sure your friend was ok and that continuing was alright. As someone who was raped, it is sometimes triggered during sex (even vanilla sex) for the strangest of reasons. Yes I like being fucked in the ass and choked but if I start crying or not being all there, I'm not in a great state of mind and a loving partner would realize that and comfort me/stop. This is obviously not a loving partner but a predator who needs to realize what he did was wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was wondering specifically about the unbleached tampons. I used to get really bad yeast infections and the organic tampons seemed to help a lot.  I can only find them at whole foods and they're like $12 a box. So paying an extra $8 to not have to make a 10-20 mile trip is worth it to me, not including chocolate and tea, etc.
I will look at amazon for those however. It just seems like everything I need is a damned add-on only item. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have hypothyroidism as well. I'm glad you finally got a doctor that cares/listens/knows what the fuck he's doing. I had doctors who ignored my pain and insisted I take metformin for two years. I finally got an endocrinologist and an obgyn who doesn't have his head up his ass and he did a laparoscopy
just to see if I had endometriosis. I didn't but they did pop some cysts while they were in there which helped a lot with the pain.

<TEXT> In a lot of pain due to PCOS and having my period.

  I had to work yesterday on Easter (I clean storage at a rental truck company) and I guess I overdid it bending over to sweep and mop, etc so today I am stuck in bed, rolling around in pain.  Horrible cramps and back pain and for some reason I am nauseous.

I recently had surgery in February and in addition to paying the obgyn $500 and the hospital $1000 I still owe the anesthesiologist $646 for a surgery that didn't even fix the extreme pain I have been suffering from for years. 

 I have a cracked tooth and need a root canal but the dentist will not offer a payment plan and demands all $800 up front. 

I told him I cannot do this since I am already paying off the surgery I just had and ended up having to cancel the appointment. 

I am going to have to find another dentist who is willing to offer a payment plan as my hours have recently been cut at work to only TWO days a week because my manager is over on payroll.  

I'm trying to put off the root canal until I get the anesthesiologist bill paid off because I am not in pain (at least in my mouth) yet but I know it needs to be done. 

I had an abcess on my gums which went away when I took antibiotics but the dentist said that in order to save the tooth I would need a root canal.  

I don't really believe the dentist I think he just wanted to make a big bill to make money, but I can't go and get a second opinion because my insurance won't cover dental. 

 The good news is that since I paid my deductible I should be covered for all medical visits for the rest of the year once I pay the dentist and anesthesiologist bills.

I have three different doctors I am going to 
an obgyn for PCOS, an endocrinologist for the PCOS and my thyroid problem, and a family doctor and every time I go I get a $200 bill for blood work and the obgyn does an ultrasound like once every three months. 

 I am really glad for my husband's job because although he doesn't get paid well he does have good insurance. There is no way we could pay all of this off if his insurance didn't cover part of it.


I am on like 5 different medications- antidepressants, birth control for my pcos, spironolactone because I have excess testosterone (due to PCOS) to help with my hairy chin and acne, a thyroid medication 
and occasionally the pain gets so bad I have muscle relaxers and ultram/tramadol. 

Sometimes the pain gets so bad I start crying.  They went in and got a lot of cysts out of my ovaries but I guess I just grew new ones because I was only pain free for like a month after the surgery.  

Sorry for the long post but I have a lot on my mind right now. :(

Also please do not suggest I "just need to lose weight"

<TEXT> I went with minimum required coverage. To save money.
BAM uninsured motorist hit my parked car.
Because I didn't pay the uninsured motorist coverage there was nothing I could do.

The worst part is we called the guy's insurance company and they said he WAS covered only to find out two days later he wasn't. His insurance company wouldn't do shit, my insurance company wouldn't do shit, and it was too late to call the cops.

The good news is the guy is in jail now for a string of like 12 burglaries in the area.

<TEXT> I had a laparoscopy because of my PCOS. I was in a lot of pain and they wanted to see if I might have endometriosis. I did not but while they were in there they got a bunch of tiny cysts out since they were causing me pain.  It was a same day surgery, they knocked me out and then I woke up like 2 hours later. The painful part was the gas. They have to blow you up with gas to see your insides better. That shit hurts so bad. I was really gassy for like 3 days. They gave me hydrocodone and I was taking them like every 8 hours because I was in a lot of pain. After about three days the pain got better but I still stayed at home for like two weeks because I have a labor intensive job and I didn't want to pop any stitches or anything. I had my surgery on february 20th and I'm completely healed but I have a tiny scar in my belly button and along my pubis.

I do not have any experience with blocked tubes but my aunt had a twisted ovary. They ended up having to remove it (the ovary) but she ended up having three girls with one ovary.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at a place that rents moving trucks and vans.

We get notifications when something is wrong with one of the vehicles. So I was trying to figure out if we had to send them to get repaired or if it was something stupid like windshield wipers. Most of the time people leave the lights on and then freak out because they have a dead battery.
It would be funny if it didn't happen SO frequently.

Anyway there were two notifications on our vans that popped up yesterday. I investigated because these vans were fine the day prior.
Apparently, we had two different people call roadside assistance yesterday. The first apparently got his van stuck a few blocks over from the store. It was raining and I guess (?) he tried to drive through mud.  All I could see on the computer was where the guy got stuck and that they determined it was the customer's fault. They had to tow him.

The second guy locked the keys in the van somewhere in New York. 

Do you think this kind of crap would happen so frequently if it was their own vehicle?

Finally someone coming with one of our trailers from Reno NV had to stop in Iowa for the night because whoever put the hitch on their car didn't do a great job and the trailer was coming loose. This is the only one of three reports that was caused due to our company's negligence. I am only including this one because we had to send someone out to fix it and pay for his hotel room. There were two adults, a cat, and a dog. And the ramada doesn't have any rooms that allow pets.  I genuinely feel bad for these people. They are more than halfway from Nevada to our location and travelling with pets is a nightmare.

<TEXT> I work at a storage/rental truck place. We have a "climate control" section. Ironically, the roof leaks. So people are paying MORE money hoping their antiques and heirlooms will be safe from the elements, not realizing that there's a very real chance their stuff will be ruined by mold and water.
Our manager is aware. Our regional manager is aware. And his response is "oh we have all these empty rooms, it's not a big deal." The thing is, the leaks are NOT in individual rooms. They are in HALLWAYS.  Yesterday I spent most of the afternoon placing buckets so I wouldn't have to mop up dirty water for the 50th time that day. I also left wet floor signs in three different places. I am leaving the buckets there because 1) maybe if it looks trashy enough they will fix the damned roof, 2) I do not want someone to slip, fall, and sue the shit out of the company and 3) We have a damned flood watch. I am not going to be back in until tuesday and nobody is going to go back there to clean up dirty water until then.  The roof has been leaking for months. Every time it snows there's a leak. Every time it rains there's a leak. For the most part I've tried ignoring it and just mopping up when I can but it all seems futile. </TEXT>

No I married him.

Would I recommend that women mate for financial stability? Absolutely. If you are planning on having a child, it is ideal to find an environment where they are going to have a good education so they don't end up perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

<TEXT> A lot of the hospitals in this area are catholic ones. I am really leaning more towards having a midwife and in the instance that I need medical intervention we have a hospital like two blocks away. I just don't want them to "push" having an epidural, an episiotomy, a cesarean, etc on me when I don't want it.
In addition to the court ordered cesarean, I believe another woman sued for an unwanted episiotomy a few years ago in this area. I just found out about this today while looking for local midwives.  These two cases were enough to seal the deal as far as my not liking hospitals.

I just had a laparoscopy the other day and the nurse ordered me to go to the bathroom after I had already went. I was waiting for like 2 hours and in pain and cranky. This nurse proceeded to argue with me that she didn't want to do a catheter and risk infection. She didn't listen to me that I had literally peed right before she showed up. If they are not going to believe me when I said I peed already, why are they going to believe me when I say I don't want a cesarean?

This hospital was in the same town as the case where they got the court order against the woman not wanting a cesarean. Like I said I just found out about this today and it's not really comforting or soothing my hospital fears at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes but when men are conditioned to think -if I buy the diamond ring, the flowers, the fancy dinner, I will get to have sex. Then they start expecting it and it's not okay. It's better for women everywhere to make it clear that we are sexual beings. Not because we want sugar daddies but because we genuinely like having sex, or if we are in a long term relationship because we love the person we are with.

<TEXT> My husband's ex would not have sex with him without getting something else in return. I think they ended up going without sex for like 6 months. And then she ended up cheating on him.

I also have an issue with the HUGE amount of cesarean sections that have been performed over the years when they were not needed. I don't care if you are a doctor, unless my life or the baby's life are in danger you should get my permission before you cut open my body!

That was 10 years ago and I've had normal paps ever since.

I'm really glad they came out with the vaccine AFTER I already had hpv lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are supposed to fill out these surveys giving our opinions of the management. I know they don't really want the truth but this is what I would say.    Part time employees should not be getting overtime while the rest of us are having our hours cut to 1 or 2 days a week because we are over on payroll and the manager lets employees work whenever and as long as they want.  I cannot pay my bills with two days a week and yet we just hired more people!  The manager shows up at 7 and consistently leaves by 11.  Employees who have been with the company for years are making the same wages as people who have no experience and were just hired.  It is no wonder why people are quitting for better jobs when they can start off at $14.50.  Most of the employees sit around talking all day and texting while the hard workers run the store, doing their own jobs in addition to everyone else's work, including the manager's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are constantly getting people coming into our store or calling and asking for "Frank" or "Joe" or 15 other people who do not and have never worked there. The only thing I can fathom is that if they call the store and we let it ring four times it goes to the call center in arizona. The call center people are morons. They are always scheduling truck reservations for trucks we don't have, hitch appointments on days when there is no hitch mechanic in the store, and generally making our job 50% harder, especially when the customer comes in and we have to tell them that the call center screwed up. We don't really have that truck available. "But the lady on the phone said!"  

Well sir that lady on the phone is a moron. She is over 2000 miles away and is too lazy to look at the computer to see that this particular truck is on the other side of the state.

Anyway, we get this at least once a day. "Is so and so here?"
 Who?

"I talked to so and so."
Nobody by that name works here.
"I just called here and talked to them 5 minutes ago!"

What's better is when after explaining how the call center works the person STILL thinks that one of the employees was the one on the phone and that somehow we are lying to them or playing a trick on them.


TL;DR Just because you talk to someone on the phone doesn't mean they actually work here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am trying to determine my next snack box subscription.  I got graze and the portions were really small. I wanted to try munchpak or oyatsubox because I love foreign treats and they can often be pretty expensive to ship overseas.  I like that munchpak is less money and has treats from ALL over but I would be pretty mad if I got all/mostly US available snacks. If I wanted that I could walk to the gas station/grocery store.  The oyatsubox seems to be more expensive but it is ALL Japanese candy. I wouldn't have to worry about getting local crap like fritos/skittles/etc.
Has anyone tried one or both of these services? What did you think? Thanks :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Disclaimer: The following post will probably be disgusting.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

"Why wouldn't they flush?" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it "It won't go down."

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled "poop won't flush" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

After much plunging and toilet bowl cleaner soaking
and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.


I felt like a champion.


I left the door propped open so the bathroom would air out.

Still I warned everyone to use the ladies' room. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I forgot to make an into post!

I am a married 28 y/o from Scranton, PA

I work at a storage /moving truck rental company with a bunch of guys and don't really have time for much makeup before work.  Normally I just do eyeliner, bb cream, and some kind of lip balm/gloss. Also I have to clean out storage units all day so by the end of the day I am gross and exhausted.  I am really in love with any kind of foot scrub because my feet get really sore from being on my feet all day.
I also use a lot of makeup/cleansing wipes at work when I get a chance
and I get really dry hands from cleaning products so I always have some kind of hand cream/lotion in my purse. 

On my day off I normally just catch up on house cleaning. Occasionally I still like to glam up however it's not as often as I'd like. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone else on spironolactone? Also: Tria laser hair removal </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-30 03:19:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started taking spironolactone two weeks ago because I have high testosterone and hirsutism / acne.  I am only on 25 mg twice a day. I did some online searches and it seems like the typical dose for acne is 100 mg while for overweight patients and those with excessive facial hair the dosage may be 250-300 mg.  I'm thinking about calling my endocrinologist to see if he will up my dosage. But from what I've read it can take up to two months to see results. So far my face is still broken out and I'm still having to shave every day, sometimes twice. :(


Also I am looking into getting a Tria hair removal laser for Christmas. It's supposed to be the closest to professional laser removal you can get at home.  I don't have the money to go get it done and it's too embarassing, I'd rather do it at home. I've already had to shave my face every day for the past 5 years, I hope something can be done. Even if it's not permanent if it just slows the hair growth it would be worth $450. It is a pretty big investment though, and if it doesn't work I don't know if I'll be able to get a refund.

Does anyone have any experience with either of these? Has anyone had any success with  getting rid of unwanted facial hair ?
I'm also on birth control so the spiro combined with that should reduce my acne but the facial hair is my biggest concern. </TEXT>
