<TEXT> man, I'm almost 3 minutes into it and I haven't even cracked a smile. What is the joke about being a kid and playing a song on a jukebox for hours on end is funny...besides the fact that it's kind of funny when you're a kid? 

I digress. Why are people laughing when he says that a small town restaurant is home to kids and (transients or something)? I must have missed that part of life. I'm from a small town but...still.

I understand everyone has their own taste and I suppose mine is completely different but I am still amazed that this is the top performance on this thread. I'm seriously questioning my humor.

I mean, shouldn't Kevin Harts Long Dick at least be above this? </TEXT>

<TITLE> If anyone is looking for something to do thids Friday, Saturday or Sunday there is a huge gathering of fife and drum corps in Deep River. It's called the muster and for those of you who don't know what it is and need something to do, read on. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Every year people from all around the world congregate upon the small town of Deep River to play, parade, and get publicly drunk. Largest gathering of it's kind in the world at least at one point...maybe still.

Tonight is the tattoo which is just a jam session on Devitt field and usually the most drunk night of the weekend. It goes until 2 am (so you still have time) but there is a camp and generally the town is cool with people partying all around until whenever. 

Tomorrow is when the parade is and the numbers really show up. It begins at 11 am. Then the rest of the day and  throughout the night again until 2 AM it rages on. 

Sunday usually has another jam session in the early part of the day and putters out in the afternoon. I won't be making it this year but I thought I would send the word out to you all if your looking for something unique to check out. 

If you do make it to the parade tomorrow be sure to look out for the Ancient Mariners. They have a guy chained up who they drag along as they drink heavily, beat the guy up, and shoot off cannons.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm using a Griffin to go into my ipad. My electric guitar has been working just fine for months. I bought an acoustic pick up for my nylon. I got it all set, plugged her in and when I try to go to turn the monitor on it doesnt seem to recognize it...sort of.
I can see the light turn green so it's getting a signal but I dont have the option to turn the monitor on like when I use my electric. It is just giving me the option to use in interapp device.
anyone know whats going on?

I have also posted this in ipadmusic but thought I would check here as well. 

Thanks

<TEXT> I can only speak for where I have lived (which is outheastern ct) but I have also spent plenty of time in most corners of the state. I find it affordable and it's close to things I love (the sound/rivers/kayaking/fishing etc) so of course I am biased. 

It's just in good proximity for me to the three cities (NY/Boston?Providence) and also good beaches in Rhode Island. I've lived from Chester down to Old Lyme and over to Niantic. 

When it comes to crime it's really not an issue set aside some random weird shit.

What is your price range? Moving with wife and kids?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand what you're saying. I do. I guess what I am getting at is when a person makes that decision to do some seriously fucked up shit like jump off a bridge with a baby, at what point did something in their head snap and go "okay, this is right"? as opposed to when a murderous drug cartel tortures someone who is "betraying" them etc. or when someone robs a bank or cheats on their wife. I am in no way saying any of that is okay I just wonder where it all goes wrong. 

What made you decide not to do something horrible in your past? I'm genuinely curious. Were you born a good person, were you raised right? Were you just a better person for some unknown reason? Good talk so far, yo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pretty good. Better than anything else I've tried here on the shoreline. While it's not really authentic they do what they do well. They put tomatoes and lettuce and shredded cheese on their tacos. I just prefer some fresh cilantro and chopped onion. 

The flavors and quality of cooking is spot on, though. 

I definitely recommend.

<TEXT> Avid kayaker here. Do you just want to stick to lakes to keep it calm? Plenty of coves around that are fairly calm. I am in Niantic but know everything north up to Haddam and east to Westbrook fairly well. [Meshershmitts](http://ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2686 q=384108 deepNav_GID=1620) in Winthrop is a great quiet spot. The lower CT River Valley is what I am very experienced with. Let me know if you are down for rivers/coves? What I usually do is open up google earth and map out routes. We have so many bodies of water around here it's crazy. Feel free to ask about any in particular. Do you fish as well? 

I started /r/connecticutkayakers a while back which doesn't really get much action but join anyway. At least we know it's people in CT that like to kayak.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All I really had cable for still was AMC and local news. I learned that my location wouldn't pick up my news station. So, I went to there website and they stream it live.

The side effect is no commercials. It's just goes to a blank screen saying well be back shortly. I stream it to my smart TV and  I'm all set. Yay. 

All in all I have noticed a huge difference in my screen time. I used to have a habit of turning on my TV, my laptop and my ipad to record music etc. Now my entire TV area is unplugged and I only turn it on to use Netflix of the random ps3 game. I bought a chromebook and the battery is amazing. Definitely saving on electricity for sure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am now realizing that I wont even be able to get my local channels even if I buy a digital antenna. The only reason I kept cable for as long as I did was for AMC (Walking Dead, Better Call Saul and Mad Men which is over) and my local NBC news station. Everywhere I've looked I wont be able to reach them. 

I am in Connecticut. Anyone else have a work around for the local broadcasts? The loss of AMC was something I was going to have to work around but not having my local news really sucks. It's a big part of morning and nightly routines. 

Thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

He's a private pilot and every year on his way back he lets us know about when to look up. We have a picnic at my grandpas in Old Lyme and he flies a bit lower and kicks in the "turbo" or whatever it's called (I don't know any technical terms). It's really cool to witness.

<TEXT> I got into them really early when they were just starting to hit the scene. Loved everything and then responsibility and my 30's hit and  for some reason keeping up on albums etc went by the wayside.

I spent a good 5-6 years just throwing on the old stuff I knew or just talk radio when it came to silence.

Listening to El Pintor for my first time all the way through. (I know, i'm late) but damn its almost a better feel knowing its a trio. That video for Everything is Wrong. Holy shit is that not the coolest video. 10/10 on that video.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I introduced it to my girlfriend last month and of course she fell in love so we got in a couple episodes a night and then a good 5 or 6 on Sundays. 

Heres the thing...we decided to split up in about the 4th season so we watched one of if not the most deep, relationship heavy shows of all time...while breaking up. We have been together for 6 years. It is fairly amicable but very tough, of course. 

We live together and I am going to be the the one moving out. She has kids (from a previous marriage) which I have grown to love and consider family. This is all very difficult but a new beginning. 

The last 4 episodes starting with Nates death was just a bawling fest but the finale, which I knew was going to be one of if not the most amazing finales was going to crush us. 

Well, it did. We spent the hour or so after the ending just sobbing...talking...apologizing for everything. We are still splitting up but it was very therapeutic to have this all coincide. 

Thank you for reading.

<TITLE> Transmission advice on an 03 Ford Ranger please. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-05 21:45:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've got an 03 Ford Ranger which has been diagnosed by two shops as needing a new transmission. It's drives but I have no reverse or O/D. It shifts into reverse and when I press on the gas it budget a bit. What I am currently doing is turning off the O/D switch on the column and manually shifting 1st into second and then second into D which it then in turn shifts itself from 3rd to 4th. 

A friend of mine has an 02 Explorer which has a blown engine but a working transmission. Both of these vehicles are 4.0 4X4 and Automatic. I'm wondering if I could switch it out? The VIN#'s for both are:

Ranger 1FTZR45E63TA39056

Explorer 1FMDU73K52ZC97255

Also, if not is there any way I could buy one online on the cheap and do it myself (I'm fairly handy). I've got a general knowledge of how these work and a 250 piece craftsman socket set but would rather pay someone if it's impossible for me to do this on my own.

<TEXT> In the late 90's I owned a [Boss BR-8](http://www.bossus.com/gear/productdetails.php?ProductId=437) and I recently came upon a dozen or so of my zip discs.

I have an [iomega zip 100](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Iomega-Zip-100-Drive-USB-100MB-pc-mac-compatible-usb-powered-nice-/201267810149) which is allowing me to download the files. They are in vs3 and vr8 formats. 

Does anyone know where to go from here? Has anyone had any luck? In a perfect world I would love it if there was a Boss app that would just accept these files and let me connect it via fire cable on my ipad.

Yah, right.

I own a windows 7 laptop and an ipad 4gen.

Any ideas?

Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Saturday while I was on the highway all of a sudden my truck slipped out of gear revving the hell out of my engine. Now, It wont work in D or R. 1st and second still work manually. They kind of go into D and R and feels like it starts to go but not really. It moves a tiny bit.
I went and pulled the codes

P0735

P1270

B1600

P0171

None of this looks good.
In have had a strange electrical issue for a while. Says door is ajar when its not, engine light go on and off, blinker is sparatic and makes a gritty noise half the time. After all this went down now the blinker works absolutely perfect while it hasn't since I've owned it.
Anyone advice on where I should start besides of course bringing it the shop. Im going crazy not knowing and nobody is around until tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last week redditgifts sent us mods a message informing us that a user would be posting clues to the secret box in this subreddit, and to keep it a secret. 

It somehow ended up in /r/hartford. Nothing against /r/hartford (they are a fine upstanding subreddit) but they have about 8,000 less subscribers. 

To ensure that the rest of connecticut gets to partake in this I am doing my own. 

**THE SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**

To keep it relevant and not lose steam I am having it this Sunday (11/23). Be sure to keep your eyes peeled to /r/connecticut Sunday at around 8AM for the riddles/clues/etc.

The first clue will point towards the general area of the state and the next clue will be given after there is ample time for anyone from any corner of the state to make it to that area...ensuring everyone can get in on it.

I promise the box won't suck. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey everyone. I plan on using my ipad to record by myself. Can I get some info on what I should get? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-29 04:27:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I will be using an acoustic guitar, electric bass, electric guitar, drum set and a midi keyboard. I will only be recording solo. I already have

1. Garageband
2. Magellan
3. DM1
4. Funkbox
5. MusicStudio 2
6. Loopy HD

What I am wondering is what should I get for an audio interface and vocal/acoustic guitar mic? Thinking of getting a mixer for the acoustic drum recording. (want to make sure what I get is compatible)

I am going to use my bestbuy credit card to get the interface and mic. 

Whats my best bet guys/gals?

Thank you. :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just had a nightmare last night (not something I normally have) that I watched a friend from high school get mauled by a grizzly.


I haven't seen this kid in 20 years. I've never seen a bear in real life. 

In the dream I was hanging out with a bunch of friends from high school (in high school times) and there happened to be a bunch of bears around. We all notice one that snuck up on us. I bolted for the car and got in along with a few of my other friends. My other friend, Dan didn't make it and I watched him get torn apart by this bear right up against the car.


I woke up as the bear had begun prying/tearing the door apart next to me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Here are my stats](http://www.rundouble.com/user/fb:604245161/E4jLy5cB)

W2D1 was very rewarding and fairly easy. Today was a beast. I may be getting shin splints, I'm not sure. The pain was almost unbearable. Also, all of the other days I felt really good and after each workout and even sometimes got that extra burst of energy. Today afterwards I really hurt, felt exhausted and almost sick to my stomach. What am I doing wrong? I stretch before each workout. Maybe not enough? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I am 36, soon to be 37. I just recently attended Beck's Providence show. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-04 06:02:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have for many years claimed he is my favorite musician/songwriter. I was introduced to him through a friend who got some shit from some skater magazine back in early high school. That is where it began. 

Long story short...it stuck.

This last show in Providence was the first time I saw him perform in over 10 years. Life just happens. We miss simple things. This performance reminded me to never let them slip by. I don't mean just Beck but any band/musician you are into. Just make it fucking happen. 

I had such a blast, enjoyed every minute of the show and just became  even more of a fan of his catalogue. 

Side note. I became a musician because of Beck and now that i have settled down and have some stability in my ,life I am slowly gathering equipment again to produce.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hi guys. I am looking for some input on what truck I should be looking for. Can anyone help? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-12 04:05:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is the breakdown.

I live in Connecticut so I need 4x4 as I have already had it with my previous jeep grand cherokee and can never go back. Winters get really rough here and my driveway is a pain


It will be my daily driver and my commute is approximately 20-25 miles a day all said and done.


I want to spend no more than $6500

I mainly need it for yard work/dump as my new house has a large yard and no woods in the back. I prefer a long bed as I will be using it for holding my kayak and summer sports gear. 

This will be my first truck. What should I be looking for? Thank you for any response.

<TITLE> The time I missed out on getting 2 free VIP tickets to a Beck show...yet still ended up going to the show. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-01 01:11:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was living in Seattle and it was around '99. I had entered a contest on Becks website to win a prize package. At the time I was 21 years old, living in a rented room in a band house and barely used the internet. 

A friend of mine bought me tickets to the Beck show at Key Arena as a surprise. It was the Midnite Vultures tour and I freaking knew it was going to be a god damn funky ass shit show. I brought my "demo tape" of  various songs I had created on a shitty four track in my back pocket. I snuck in a joint and had my robot dancing shoes on. 

Ths show, of course kicked ass. The one thing that really stood out was when he did Debra he started it by being lowered down on a king size bed. I thought that shit was the smoothest thing I had ever seen (and still do). At some point I threw my tape up on stage only to see some stage hand kick it back off :(....

Cut to about 3 days after the show I receive a good size package in the mail at work (that was the only address I really trusted at that time) I open it up to find every Beck album released to date...signed by Beck, a t-shirt and a letter that explained what everything was and it said "we hope you enjoyed your VIP experience" 

WTF!!!!

I rev up my bosses beige IBM desktop and sign on to my hotmail (which I never checked...apparently) to find an email congratulating me on winning the prize package. I was to pick up my 2 VIP passes at will call at the same fucking show I went to. 

Yep. That happened. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I am on day 4 of being a non-smoker and am currently taking chantix. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-12 22:35:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The only side effect I have come across so far is being a bit spaced out and super super vivid dreams. No nightmares just super realistic mundane everyday shit with all of the people I know and in all the places I know them. Every night since my first day of being a non-smoker I have smoked in my dreams. Yet, in my dream I knew it was wrong and it was not good. I have woken up each morning thinking I had cheated. 

So far chantix has helped me deal with what I could not. Cravings. Now it's all mental. I have an argument with myself about 20 times daily. It's usually me trying to convince myself to just have one after a trigger. Not happening. I am able to get past that withing 5 minutes. I started carrying around those [plastic floss sticks](http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_47578_2.jpg). They are a great way to get the oral fixation out of the way and keep my teeth clean.

I have smoked since I was 14. I am just about to turn 35. The past ten years I was up to a 1.5-2.5 a day depending on circumstances. I feels so strong that I am on day 4 and am actually proud of myself for once in many many years. 

Thank you for reading my quick rant. </TEXT>

Creative is always good, but not needed. You got a phone bill or car insurance bill that is behind? Maybe you want to see a concert/show and can't swing it right now (thanks josh) let me know. 

Don't be ashamed to ask for help, okay?

Edit: One electric bill shut off notice and one swedish drinker taken care of. Cheers guys. I love all of you fucking booze faces. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday I finally caught a large mouth while out on my kayak. I ran into a guy on his bass boat and we got to talking. I was dragging a worm across the bottom by the weeds and my freaking pole went nuts. 

When I finally got him about 10 feet from my kayak he took my pole about a foot into the water. The guy who is an avid bass fisherman was actually amped/ "Holy shit dude that a biggy"

This fish finally came up and jumped over the tip of my kayak. Coolest looking thing. It was such a rush. 

Sadly I was not able to get a picture and as I was pulling it up next to me it got loose. :( The dude on the boat said it was probably a 6-7 pounder.

I know to most of you this is old news in a bucket but for me it was like christmas morning. 

Anyway I just wanted to tell my tale of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I plugged the sucker in and windows couldn't find the driver. I am using a windows 7 64 bit laptop. So, I went and found the driver(s). The first one installed just fine but the second one (legacy software download) didnt. It said a a time out error. Anyway I go and download audacity because I have fiddled with it over the years and know it is a really stripped down program that some buddies of mine would use when we would write songs. Now I am able to choose the audiobox from the output/speaker menu in Audacity but it is nowhere in the input/mic menu. Does this make any sense to any of you? I am sorry for putting this in the regular askreddit sub but if any of you know a really specific sub for this please let me know and I will move it over there. I am just dying to get some of these songs down on (tape?) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Over this past weekend I uploaded a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ4J-c1We-s) of my friends' dog dancing to The Miami Sound Machine. First as a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13ndm0/my_dog_has_a_meltdown_when_i_give_her_a_beggin/c75jfpa) and then as it's own [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13nlmy/my_friends_dog_decided_to_dance_today_for_some/). I posted it at night and woke up to it playing on The Today Show. My friend told me that after looking through the statistics it had most definitely gotten it's original traffic through reddit.


* Do you get paid to sift through sites or is it an added on job to what you already do?

* Do the hosts understand Reddit?

* Are you an active member or just a lurker?

* Can you get me a job doing this? I know how to spend too much time on Reddit.

* Can you get one of the hosts to wear a reddit alien on the air?
