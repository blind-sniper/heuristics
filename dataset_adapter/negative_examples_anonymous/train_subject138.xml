This advice originates in long years of military training for hand-to-hand combat.  
  
1. There is no such thing as a "fair fight". That being said, avoid fighting all-together, but if that option is off the table, go for the opponents' soft spots and joints. This includes the eyes, throat, stomach, groin, knees, elbows, shoulders and feet. It only takes two pounds of pressure to snap a knee or elbow.  
  
2. Keep moving your feet, don't lock your knees, and watch your opponent's midsection because it will indicate where the next attack is coming. Stay on your feet but keep in mind that the goal is to neutralize your opponent and make them no longer a threat. The eyes and throat are prime targets because both areas are important to the average person. If your opponent is worried about losing an eye or the ability to breathe, he/she is more likely to disengage. </TEXT>

In fact, any economic ideology that competes with capitalism will be a hard fought battle for any generation.

When taxes are proposed on the wealthy or corporations, the US elites political watch dogs begin screaming that it's a scheme to transfer wealth between social groups and a form of class warfare. Meanwhile, smirking in the background are wealthy individuals, sipping on a nice single-malt scotch, and thinking to themselves what a bunch of ignorant putzes populate the rest of the nation. </TEXT>

reasoning: when the romans crucified someone, they did it by the book. this was especially true with jesus because his crucifixion was political in nature. one of the romans strictest rules was that only family could visit or collect the body after death. mm's inclusion into the viewing party at the tomb means she must have been married to jesus or the romans wouldn't have let her anywhere near him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's see how many religious nuts I can offend by providing evidenced based proof about J's marital status:  
  
When the Romans crucified an individual, it was usually done by the book. However, since J's crucifixion was politically motivated, the Roman soldiers tasked with overseeing his execution would be far more attentive to the rules. A major rule the Romans wouldn't have bent for anyone was that only family was allowed to view the body while it remained in their custody. One of those allowed to see j's body was Mary Magdalene. This means that she was either related to j or she was his wife. 
  
Looking at the whole ordeal from the contemporary Roman POV, j was just another jewish idiot claiming to be important, and there were a lot of those during the period. A good example is j. the bapt., who claimed to be a prophet and healer sanctioned by g to dunk people in water. It is only time that has provided the event with any importance, especially for the Romans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want to enjoy the movie even more, Brian Greene does this wonderful series called [Beyond the Cosmos](http://www.primewire.ag/watch-2733300-Beyond-the-Cosmos-online-free) that explains in simple terms the relationship between time, gravity, and space. It blows my mind that the farther away from Earth that a person travels in space, time runs slower for them. The arrow of time runs in only one direction for humans, however, in physics and quantum mechanics the arrow of time is malleable and can move in both directions. It almost appears as if the writers of *Interstellar* wrote the movie after watching Greene's series. If you watch his series, Interstellar takes on a whole different level of pleasure and awe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not being trashy, that's being naive.  
  
For example, I grew up extremely poor and joined the military right out of high school. Because my family was so poor, I'd never eaten in a restaurant until a very pretty girl asked me to dinner at *Ye Olde Oyster House* in Boston. I was stationed with the 10th special forces group at Ft. Devens, Mass. and I was excited about my restaurant visit. She ordered a drink and I ordered an ice tea; when tea is served in the south it usually came pre-sweetened, but this Boston so it was without sugar. I promptly used every cane sugar packet on the table to make the tea sweet enough. The waitress brought cornbread to the table as a snack while we looked the menu over. The cornbread I'd grown up with was thin, bitter, and a type of hard tack, but the waitress had brought what appeared to me to be cake. Without saying anything to my date, I flagged down the waitress and told her she'd brought us desert before the meal and that we'd not ordered any cake. Both the waitress and my date assured me it was cornbread. As we ordered, I didn't recognize anything on the menu when I spotted a dish made with eggs that looked edible. So I ordered the quickee, which made the waitress giggle and my date blush. It was actually quiche, and I didn't eat much of it. After this affair I never heard from or saw my date again. While this may have appeared trashy to anyone watching, it was simple naivete.  
  
When I see poor people acting inappropriately, I understand the reasons behind their action.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My suggestion isn't new. Theodore Roosevelt was the first to suggest testing as a requirement of government service during the late 1890s. Prior to testing, when a new republican/democratic legislation came to power, the winners handed out government positions as a reward system. The system meant the US government operated with the same level of dysfunction on display in New Orleans when G.W. Bush's buddy "Brownie" was in charge. Roosevelt adopted tests that are still given to federal workers today to assess their fitness for the position, thus doing away with the cronyism that limited government's functionality. My argument is that we need another method to assess the next level of government - our legislators. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All religions, by design, set people apart from one another by claiming their adherents are special and morally superior. This is utter bs. Religions pass moral judgments on unbelievers, while also attempting to force their morality on the societies they exist within. I'm expected to respect the folklore that the adherent lives by, but my rejection of this is seen as wrong. Without religion there is no war in the middle east, no rejection of LGBT rights, and no deaths because of rejecting religious beliefs. </TEXT>

A guy is fucking his girlfriend in the missionary position but instead of showing any reaction, she just lays there, not moving. Starting to get angry, he flips her over on her stomach and starts really pounding her doggy style, but again she doesn't move. Now really upset, the guy shoves it in her backdoor while redoubling his efforts, but to no avail. After finishing, the guy rolls off his girlfriend who looks at him and said, "That was really presumptuous of you."  
  
"Presumptuous?," he repeated.  
  
"Yes," she said, "it was presumptuous of you to put it in my butt hole."  
  
"Presumptuous," he repeated again. "That's a pretty big word for a twelve-year-old." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The most gruesome thing I've ever seen is actually a compilation of two events by the same person. I grew up in a very rural southern area and one of our neighbors was an alcoholic. One summer day he was drunk and decided to commit suicide by placing a shotgun against his chest and pulling the trigger while sitting on the sofa in his living room. The blast left big chunks of the guy's chest and back on the wall behind him, but it didn't kill him. Following the trail of blood around the house, he got up from the couch, went into the kitchen and got another beer, then drank it at the kitchen table. Next, he went upstairs, sat on the edge of his bed for a while, before wandering back downstairs to the couch where he passed out. The crazy thing is that he survived.  
  
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm now a sophomore in high school. Our neighbor has been caught so many times driving drunk that he's spent a year in jail, and lost his driving privileges along with his car. This doesn't slow my neighbor down one little bit as he has purchased a really nice riding lawnmower, removed its governor, and it now can reach speeds of up to 15mph. We lived on a gravel/dirt road with really heavy traffic and people loved to drive fast on it. One morning I'm on the school bus as we start the fifteen mile trip to our high school. I hear a shriek from a girl at the front of the bus, and the breaking bus threw me into the seat back. I looked out the window where the other kids were pointing and draped across a tree branch was our neighbor, twisted and dead. They found his riding lawnmower in the deep grass beyond the road. A man later came forward who said he knew he'd hit something but didn't know what. He assumed it was a deer that had survived the impact and run off because the lawnmower was hidden by the deep grass. He didn't see a body, of course, because it'd been thrown into and caught by tree branches. Seeing the results of this man's suicidal behavior twice left me with a propensity for nausea at meals that my brothers exploited viciously.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was ten-years-old someone abandoned their dog near our rural Tennessee home. My dad worked two jobs and refused to allow the family to have a dog because he considered them too expensive. I knew that my dad would think we encouraged the dog to stay, and punish us with whippings using his belt. In order to avoid this, I took the dog deep into the woods around our house. I placed it on the center of a very old bed sheet by telling it to sit and it obeyed with heart-breaking enthusiasm. I then took the .22 caliber rifle I'd brought along, and put a bullet between the dog's eyes. I'm still horrified and haunted by what I did that day, but I'm even angrier that poverty and my dad's adherence to a brutal religiosity placed a ten-year-old me into such a despicable situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Name calling is the last bastion of a losing argument. You concentrate only on "fundamentalists" as the bad lot while my argument is that religion in every form is inherently repressive, especially to those who aren't members. Several good examples of this are the current battles in the US being fought over access to abortion, and same-sex marriage. Remove religion from the argument and there is no opposition. Because of some stupid beliefs begun thousands of years earlier, large segments of the female US population live without access to life saving abortions, and same-sex couples can't enjoy the same legal protections as their heterosexual counterparts.  
  
If you're going to respond further, let me ask just one question. What unique quality did Judaism have that was lacking in all the other religions prior to its inception? What set it apart from all other religions? As Neil deGrasse Tyson repeatedly points out, it's okay not to know the answer. No one has all the answers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another ad hominem argument, so you didn't really learn anything at all.  
  
We are only going to continue talking past one another because we see the world in very different ways. I learned this from my oldest brother who is a preacher at a Church of Christ denomination in the american south. He saw the world through the lenses of "god" while my vision was obscured by my "godlessness." His conclusion came after I'd asked too many "unfair" questions concerning his beliefs. The most offensive question was "what is a day to god." He firmly believes in creationism as presented in the "bible" that is limited to six days with a seventh day for rest. His "god" just happened to follow the cycle of our planet's daily revolution. But to claim that this information is correct means understanding the mind of his "god", something that is supposed to be unknowable. Religious people are annoyed by these contradictions when they're pointed out.  
  
The same problem applies to our conversation. You are willing to allow specious claims based on your religious views, and participate in a form of suspension of disbelief that might be called "faith". I don't share this predilection for applying "faith" based on the observance of a set of rules formed by individuals who lived thousands of years ago. In its purest form, religions are a method to control and funnel the hopes and fears of a downtrodden portion of the world's population. It banks on the the promise of an afterlife of paradise for a chosen few. I know this is the only life available to me and I refuse to waste it propping up the beliefs of an elitist few.  </TEXT>

I don't care what your interpretation of a religious text entails, they're all fantasy to me. Israel finds it acceptable to target women and children during wartime operations, while ISIS chooses its own targets according to religion and prefers beheadings over bombs. Both are dispicable courses of action, but met with approval by each religions' adherents. I see no distinction between the horrors visited upon those within each sects' religious boundaries. So defend blind adherence to your religion, but don't ask me to validate it. </TEXT>

It means respecting ridiculous beliefs put forward in any form of a "holy book" whether it's called a koran, bible, etc. Here's my advice: Don't blindly follow any ideology that resists being questioned or criticized, because it's the result of another person's thinking.

<TEXT> I was wondering this myself. My dad is a deeply religious man who believed people had forgotten the true meaning of the holiday. As a family, we stopped giving presents or putting up decorations when I was a ten-year-old. Looking back, I now believe our family was too poor to afford the gift-giving aspect of the holiday and he used religion as an excuse. Today, the holiday has no meaning for me, especially now that I avoid religion. Friends get mad at me for refusing their gifts, but I just don't want to participate in what's essentially become an orgy of consumerism. My attitude often worked against me because I waited tables a good portion of my life in an upscale restaurant located in a five-star hotel that remained open 365 days a year. Guess who always got stuck working alone on xmas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Race has long played a role in housing restrictions, both in Europe and the Americas. These books explore the myriad ways local, state, and federal governments implemented policies that were driven by business interests. Two organizations performed dominate roles in policy creation - the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Realtors. Both are lobbying groups with incredible power, but together they created the process of redlining and restrictive covenants. These practices assured white homeowners within the redlined districts or under covenants that the neighborhood would remain white. Participating homeowners could not sell their homes to anyone deemed unsuitable, to include just about all immigrants or AA. This meant our cities were incredibly stratified by race, with AA being forced into the most rundown and neglected neighborhoods by these restrictions and the cost of rents. As a consequence, the white business and political communities would point to the ruin and use it as an excuse as to why the two races could never co-mingle, ignoring the fact that local government policies gave AA nowhere else to live.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can reply to the OP as a historian, and since one of the replies mentions Detroit, I'll suggest one of urban historians' favorite books: Sugrue, Thomas. The Origins of the Urban Crisis : Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. Princeton  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996.  
  
Sugrue tracks the decline of Detroit and places the blame squarely on the city's political and economic elite who promoted racist policies that promoted the ghettoization of African Americans in small clusters while whites fled to the suburbs. This is a matter repeated across american cities and I'll provide more books that address this subject:  
  
Hirsch, Eric. Urban Revolt : Ethnic Politics in the Nineteenth-Century Chicago Labor Movement. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990.  
  
Kruse, Kevin. White Flight : Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism. Princeton  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2005.  
  
Avila, Eric. Popular Culture in the Age of White Flight : Fear and Fantasy in Suburban Los Angeles. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006.  
  
Self, Robert. American Babylon : Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland. Princeton  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2003.  
  
All of these texts reveal the persistence of local government in creating policies that marginalized AA or the poor using housing as an instrument in erecting boundaries designed to keep the elite shielded from the poor. Again, this trend has reversed with rising rents pushing the poor and minorities out of cities and into the suburban landscape. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please understand that I didn't mean you're "all wrong" because that's not my intention. I'm sure there are a plethora of smart redditors, including yourself, but crowd sourcing the understanding of America's constitution is a risky way to get that information. For example, an individual may know a lot about performing surgery from reading literature about the subject, and even be able to speak the jargon. However, having never performed surgery, would you want this individual opening you up? It's simple for a person to regurgitate information that they learned on the history channel or discovery channel (both are horrible sources), even perhaps on wikapedia, but it's an understanding that's usually ideologically driven by the source, and is suspect. I'm also saying that american media has failed its audience because it no longer informs or challenges the prevailing dogma of contemporary political parties. In many instances a "news" channel will deliberately misinform its viewers to elicit a particular reaction. With such odds stacked against the average american it's no wonder they are poorly informed about their constitutional rights.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To understand an inkling of the Constitution's authors intent requires reading a historiography on the subject.  
  
A good starting point is Peter H. Irons. A Peoples History of the Supreme Court. New York: Viking, 1999. Irons points out that the US was founded on the notion of law, but it was a law interpreted by the white, wealthy, landholding men, the majority of which were lawyers. The overwhelming problem facing the new government was slavery. "It seemed now to be pretty well understood," Madison said, "that the real difference of interest lay, not between the large and small but between the northern and southern states. The institution of slavery and its consequences formed the line of discrimination." For those who don't know, Madison was the only individual to keep complete notes about the process from start to finish. He was also the engine that drove the process, while Jefferson wasn't even there. He was serving as a diplomat in France when the Constitution was written. Madison's notes were not released until after all the participating members died. From these notes we know that "wealth" was used as an euphemism to describe slaves. His notes reveal the debate about just who should be allowed to vote in this new country. "The delegates argued about who should be allowed to vote in elections, because among the landed classes, those without lands were considered too ignorant to be trusted with voting. To alleviate their fears, the delegates decided that the state's legislators would choose the two members of the Senate, a rule that finally changed in 1913."(p 26)  
  
If we still followed the founders' thinking on government, a much smaller portion of the population would be allowed to vote. I offer this example to highlight that the Constitution's authors were imperfect men who tried to create a form of government that incorporated methods to change or amend the document as the nation grew. Those that argue we should adhere to their founding vision overlook the myopic nature of that vision. Additionally, injecting economic visions on the Constitution's authors is incredibly short sighted as the contemporary economic business model of capitalism was still sixty years away, and they had no idea how it would impact Americans.  </TEXT>

For instance, a man who possessed the power to raise the dead was crucified by Romans and came back to life, is considered kosher, but an indigenous peoples' belief that a turtle balanced the earth on its back is considered suspect. Both are myths. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've argued that term limits are the way to go with the SC, but Roosevelt's plan was too broad for its time. I believe that term limits would allow a greater variety of law opinions to influence the court, as the turnover would create more opportunities for sitting judges. It would force the court to experience the same generational change that is occurring now at the local and federal level. As younger generations enter into the political process the nation has experienced a sea change in the way drug crimes are being prosecuted, and mj has become legal in many states. Another area we've seen progress is in lgbt laws that allow marriage or civil unions. </TEXT>

This is well documented in primary documents from the period but I'll offer you a list of books that back up this assertion.

<TEXT> There is nothing like seeing Vegas on acid. A group of us went to a rave in Vegas, but the event got shut down not long after it started because under 21's were found sneaking in. The seven of us had already taken a couple of mdma pills and a gelcap of acid on entering the event and we now found ourselves pushed out onto the Strip. It was a blast. We went into the Bellagio, and someone had the bright idea that we should all buy drinks so that it looked like we were drunk. One of the girls bought this bright red frozen concoction that she just carried and never drank. The casino's rugs resulted in so many funny visions that one of our group refused to walk out onto it because she might sink. We noticed hotel security had begun following us so we left for the Mirage. Once out the Bellagio's door, my friend who bought the red drink realized it had melted and proceeded to dump its contents onto this beautiful marble entrance. If she'd been sober this would never have happened, but all of us immediately knew this could mean trouble. We hustled out of the area and on to the Mirage. We made it about 10 minutes in the casino before finding security was again following us, so again we left. When we arrived at Excalibur, security was already waiting but because we hadn't done anything really wrong they just followed us around. I think they figured out we weren't really drunk and were just having a fun time watching us trip. I still remember sitting down at a chinese restaurant to eat, and one of the guys asking if I was still tripping? I lifted the menu to turn it over and saw myself looking down this great deep well where the menu had sat. When I told my friends, we all agreed I was still tripping. I've been to Vegas on many occasions but that was the best time I've ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the things I learned from military instructors for personal defense is that there is no such thing as dirty fighting in hand-to-hand combat. We were taught that in any physical altercation the ultimate goal was to end the threat within context of events. If fear of imminent death existed, nothing was off limits. For less serious threats, attacks to the softest areas of the body were encouraged. The throat, groin, ribs, elbow and knee joints, eyes, and ears were the surest means to end any personal threat. If someone wanted to complain, it was to be while they're looking up at you, and no longer a threat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother became a prescription pill addict and alcoholic around 1972 after suffering a burn injury when her nightgown caught fire after she fell asleep with a cigarette. She experienced multiple skin grafts to her right upper arm, breast and neck area, taken from skin harvested from the back of her legs. I was an 8 y.o. kid with three older brothers who worked and a dad who labored at two jobs to afford the operations and the drugs. We lived in extreme poverty so my mom's injury and the resulting addictions only made matters worse. My dad refused to accept public assistance because of the stigma attached to its users so we were often hungry before and during school.  
  
Many families become closer when faced with adversity but ours seemed to go in a different direction. Because there were seven of us, the competition for attention, toys, and resources could be brutal. I found myself taking complete care of my youngest sister who was born just prior to my mother's accident, and partial care for my two younger siblings, a brother and sister. Meanwhile, my mother seemed to have lost all interest in our existence after her recovery from injury. I didn't realize until three years after I left home for the military that my mother was an addict. We were so isolated by our rural existence and my dad's religiosity that our mother's odd behavior of staying up for days on end, and sleeping until the late afternoon seemed the norm. We were forbidden to use milk because she used it for her coffee, and we were expected to use powdered milk for cereal. I cooked for my siblings, but meals were simple things like PB J and mac/cheese, or grilled cheese sandwiches. I don't remember any of us eating before school because we were always late catching the bus.  
  
By the time I left home, I felt disgust for mother's behavior and anger at my dad because he was a stranger. I believed dad took two jobs just because he didn't want to be home. My relationship with my mother was so poor, I didn't speak to her for the entirety of her remaining life, even after she got sober. And she did spend the last ten years of her life sober, but by that time the concept of having a mother was foreign to me. I didn't know how to feel sad about her death because she meant nothing to me. Today, I have no relations with my family because we don't know how to act towards one another. We are emotional strangers, only able to express the most primitive of feelings such as anger or disgust.  
  
I guess a summation of my mother's sickness on my life would include a deep distrust of women, and a serious emotional impairment that keeps others at arm's length and promotes a lone wolf existence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The affordability of lawyers has been an issue in the US since its inception and I don't have any solution for this problem. In the case of Dred Scott, he was forced to run an ad in the New York Times begging for a lawyer to argue his case before the Supreme Court. As for for solutions to the SC's activism, it's up to Americans to demand a more just system. Justices are given lifetime appointments, proponents argue, to keep them above the political fray; this is completely untrue and justices need to be held accountable when they ignore the law in favor of political expedience. To date, only three schools of law are represented at this highest level - Yale, Harvard, and Columbia. This is a trend that began in the 1950s and it limits the social understanding of sitting justices who reside in that rarefied air occupied by the elites. I personally believe that the justices should have term limits of between 10 and 12 years, at which time new justices are vetted. This allows for a type of generational change that allows the SC to remain current with the times. As for the burbs and white americans, these trends are now driven more by the economy than race. I would argue that "poor is the new black." </TEXT>

<TEXT> To understand racism in the United States we must begin with the Constitution's role, which placed a black person's worth at 3/5's of a white person. Most Americans believe the document was written to protect them, and this is true if they can afford a lawyer to represent them. But the average American can't afford to hire lawyers so they remain unrepresented under the Constitution. We also live at the mercy of how the Supreme Court justices interpret the law and this is extremely worrying. When presented with multiple opportunities to correct the country's flagrant racism - think Dred Scott or *Plessy v. Ferguson* - the SC justices throughout history failed miserably.  
  
Our national government also failed to curb racism, but the real heinous reason that racism remained so integral to white americans is African Americans (AA) treatment by local governments. Red lining and covenants kept out not only AA but also jews, irish, italian, sicilian, and some eastern europeans. When these practices were finally deemed unconstitutional and minorities moved into mainly white spaces, white americans fled to the suburbs. This is the reason for the busing controversies of the 1970's when the government forced the integration of the school system. That trend has now reversed with AAs moving to the outskirts of cities and into the burbs with white americans repopulating cities. </TEXT>

The US believes in setting benchmark scores on our elementary and high school students that determine teachers' abilities and the students' learning. Isn't having an informed legislator as important as childhood education? As with term limits, contemporary politicians rebel against any changes that require them to prove competency, but imagine how many idiot politicians such a policy would weed out. If this had been in place in 2000, the US could have avoided the whole stupid Bush presidency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's easy to blame Americans for not knowing the issues, but it's because they are overworked and lack the time necessary to understand the issues. However, the blame really falls on the news service industry because it tailors the news cycle for a specific viewer in order to increase advertising sales on its specific channel.  
  
Politicians take advantage of the average American's lack of understanding by pushing the "fear" button. As an independent in a two-party system, I've noticed that republicans are especially adept at massaging American's fears. It's as if they took FDR's statement "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself" and used it as a campaign strategy. It's literally the party of wealthy cowards because so many things seem to scare republicans such as: immigrants, muslims, viruses, election fraud, gun laws, LGBT, unions, renewable energy, science, and campaign finance laws. By pushing the fear button, politicians have discovered an easy way of tricking Americans into voting against their own best interests. It's a sad state of affairs for a once proud nation that's claimed to be a democracy, but in reality its political system has only been another form of control by a white majority that now finds itself on the way to being a minority. </TEXT>

It allows one form in the middle east to impose a vile form of control over a small arab population, targeting women and children in an effort to destroy the inhabitants future. It provides justification for destroying the earth through climate denial, and control over women's health issues. In every form, religion is a fairytale that allow those with a guilty conscious to find absolution for past and future wrongs, and a tool for oppressing the individual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rich aren't stupid, but they can't think creatively. The most recent writing on this comes from William Deresiewicz, *Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite*. The wealthy are so sheltered from the population that it experiences a level of naivety in relation to poverty. The last time the US experienced such a level of inequality between the haves and have-nots was in the 1920s. Unlike today, the wealthy lived shoulder-to-shoulder with the poor because the car was still in its infancy, restricting the distance for travel to work. Additionally, when the Great Depression struck the US, the government didn't protect the rich. This had an equalizing effect on public opinion of the poor, as the former-wealthy found themselves at the bottom. Much of the support for New Deal programs came from this re-evaluation of public sentiment towards the poor, and the government's responsibility to uplift those most in need.  
  
Had Wall Streets most powerful been left to Adam Smith's invisible hand, a large portion of the wealthy would've experienced a new reality, and you can bet they'd be demanding changes, just as occurred during the New Deal period. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I once considered myself a middle-class American, but I came from generational poverty that my mom and dad couldn't escape. To live a better life than my parents, I worked 2 jobs to make my bills if I lived alone, or one job and attended school while having a roommate. When first starting out, I blamed my parents' for the poverty we lived in, even though my dad was working two jobs to support our large family. He became a stranger in my life, unable to attend baseball games, help with homework, or offer any of the life lessons to ensure my success as an adult. I now realize the heroic sacrifice my dad made to keep me fed, clothed, and sheltered, by forgoing his own comfort and sticking around. He voted Republican.  
  
Unlike the author, I do behave like a corporation in my day-to-day dealings with the corporate world. I think of this as 'exploiting hidden investment opportunities.' When I find a loophole in, for example, a corporate coffee shop or drugstore, I exploit it viciously. The same applies to energy companies, television/radio entertainment, and travel. And like a corporation, I feel absolutely no remorse for my actions. I feel no pity for the corporate world or the monied class because I know they care nothing at all for me. I encourage anyone and everyone to behave like a corporation, and look for ways to exploit them. </TEXT>

The majority of the Constitution's framers were lawyers, a profession most colonists distrusted, which made ratification an extremely difficult task. Peter Irons addressed the class divide and its ramifications for the average Americans in *A People's History of the Supreme Court*. Irons stated that the Constitution supports a legal system that requires the individual to employ lawyers, a financial burden that deterred the most economically disadvantaged from filing a suit. Even the defendants in the most famous cases often needed pro bono assistance, as in the case of Dred Scott, who placed an appeal in the NY Times for representation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in a small Turkish city in the mid 1980s and the country was under military rule. I learned that Mustafa Kemal Ataturk fought hard to create a secular system of government because he understood the instability inherent in a religious system of government. It seems his vision is collapsing back into another version of the Ottoman empire that Ataturk despised. Turkey isn't joining the fight against Daesh because it would help the Kurdish people, and strengthen their fight for an independent region. This move may backfire, as Daesh could possibly overrun Turkey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ill begin with the construction of the Supreme Court, which consist of 8 Justices and one Chief Justice. There are currently 9 federal circuit courts with a SCJ assigned to each circuit, a tradition begun by George Washington when he chose the Courts first justices, which he did by region as a means to appease the infant nations eclectic population. A SCJ serves for life, unless they retire, resign, or suffer impeachment; the reasoning for the lifetime provision is to place the SCJ above the political fray. This rationale has never been true, and I would challenge one to find more than a handful of SCJ who werent ideologically committed to the political party that brought their nomination. Beginning with Washington, who chose only loyal federalists while president, each POTUS has searched for candidates that reflect their, and the Partys, ideology. Pundits describe a justice as conservative or liberal, but these are just code words for Republican or Democratic. The Courts mandate is to test the constitutionality of legislation, a power it derived from *Marbury v. Madison* in 1803. The Constitutions original and driving intent is to protect white, male, property owners from legislation that would impede economic growth. With this mandate in mind, the Courts decision to expand free speech rights in *Citizens United* played right into its wheelhouse. Let me explain why.  
  
The contemporary Courts roots are planted in the Reagan/Bush Era, and both administrations stated strategy to place enough justices to gain the five votes necessary to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. The 1990 presidential election between Bush/Clinton was a mandate on the abortion issue because whoever won would choose a minimum of 2 justices. Clinton vowed to protect *Roe* with his nominations, and the people responded by choosing the Arkansas governor. Had Bush won, his nominations wouldve joined Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. Instead, Clinton placed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Joseph Breyer, a move that dampened any move to challenge the abortion law. I mention this because the abortion issue turned on the personhood of a fetus and when it gained viable recognition.  
  
When it comes to determining personhood, the Courts record is woeful. Beginning with the *Dred Scott* case, the Court denied blacks any of the Constitutions enumerated protections. Chief Justice Roger Taney decision stated they were property, regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights that the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his own benefit. Historians describe this decision as the opening shot in the Civil War. The passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were the price to fix slavery, but the Court created two levels of citizenship, national and state, that it applied to *Plessy v. Ferguson*, and in support of separate but equal legislation.  
  
As both the abortion and civil rights issues discussed above demonstrate, the Court is more comfortable ruling on the personhood of a corporation than that of society. The idea that the Constitution might protect the average American on gained prominence with the Warren Court, and the rights it provided are being eyed jealously by a conservative base that finds the rights of labor, women, immigrants, and the poor alien to the Constitution.

<TEXT> I enjoyed the writeup by the mods, but I want to caution that understanding the U.S. political system requires first answering who was the Constitution designed to protect?  
  
Contrary to most American's understanding, unless the individual was a white male property owner, the Constitution was not written with you in mind. Additionally, when the word "property" was used in the Constitution, it was understood as a code for referring to slaves. Another fallacy was that the founders were a bunch of farmers, but nothing could be farther from the truth; most were merchants and forty-seven percent were practicing lawyers. This is one of the reasons it was so difficult to get the Constitution ratified, as most colonialists deeply distrusted lawyers.  
  
Of even greater importance is the fact that the founders did not trust the public to understand politics well enough to participate in voting, considering it a threat to a democracy. You see, they thought the average person was not smart enough and chose, instead, to saddle future Americans with an electoral system. You can thank the system, and the Supreme Court, for giving the world George W.  
  
Finally, the Constitution was written to support an economic system of growth, but it was not the capitalist system because that was yet to develop. Instead, it was written for a market system. All the laws that Americans follow were adopted as the economic system changed, but the original intent of protecting propertied owners remains the focus of our Constitution. It was only with the Warren Court that individual rights gained prominence, along with the passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Act. It was only then that America almost reached its goal of being a fully democratic nation. Until LGBT individuals gain the same legal rights promised to American citizens, the U.S. will not be "the land of the free." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe most Democrats have shifted right over the years, becoming what were once called moderate Republicans. Living through the Clinton years, Democratic politics became actively pro-corporation, a quality once reserved for the Republican Party. The regulations that kept Wall Street from wrecking the economy since the 1930s were dismantled under Clinton, and Obama continues enjoying a cozy relationship with corporate leaders, despite his rhetoric. If Hillary Clinton wins the Dems nomination and becomes the first female president, don't expect any changes to the financial gambling taking place on Wall Street.  
  
That being said, if the Republicans win back both houses, it will join forces with the conservative wing of the Supreme Court, and create laws that roll back the social advances made by the Warren court. This might lead to overturning *Roe v Wade*, denial of same-sex marriage rights, defunding or overturning of the ACA, renewed support for the carbon energy sector, and more support for the surveillance state.  
  
If the Republicans win back the presidency, the party can pack the Supreme Court with a solid conservative majority after Ginsburg retires. Unlike the Warren court, which interpreted the Constitution as protecting the people, the Roberts court views it as supporting corporations. Additionally, the Republican control of all three branches of government may result in a continued weakening of the separation between church and state. The Hobby Lobby ruling is just the opening foray by conservative S.C. justices in regaining their idealized understanding of the good old days. </TEXT>

The Israeli government and its military lost any credibility after targeting those children playing on the beach. In fact, Israel began fomenting trouble when the US started talks with Iran, and countries of the world began recognizing Palestine as a nation. When Palestine applied for recognition with the UN, Israeli leadership went ballistic with anger. The disappearance of three Israeli teens gave hardliners in Israel the excuse they needed to seek an invasion, and unjustly claim the role of victim. It's almost as if Israel has said to the international community, "Okay, if you want to recognize the rights of Palestine, we'll just wipe them off the map."

<TEXT> I missed the foreshadowing you mention, but now it makes sense. I viewed the way the characters died (sun or freeze) based on the morality they portrayed. The captain, psych officer, nuclear engineer, and his female friend all show a deep appreciation of other people's lives, and die by fire - which is considered a good death.  
  
The communication officer and engineer are more concerned with their own lives or the mission's success, and ignore the needs of others. The comm officer is willing to take the last space suit to survive, and the engineer is willing to murder the grieving nav officer to save oxygen. Both die by freezing, which is an irony because they're so close to the sun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been a while since I've seen the movie, but I'll try.  
  
The Captain dies first during a space walk to repair the heat shield that protects the ship. As the ship's computer makes the necessary corrections to the shield, he is exposed and vaporizes.  
  
The communication's officer is the next to die. After the ship docks with its long-lost counterpart that was launched years earlier and considered destroyed, the exploratory crew become stranded when the ships unexpectedly break the connection. As the new commander, the communications officer demands the derelict ships only spacesuit, but the engineering officer gives it to the nuclear engineer because of his necessity to the mission's completion. This is a form of moral weakness and fear of death. To make it back to the home ship, the communications officer and the engineer must wrap up in the derelict ship's insulation to survive the cold of space in the short interval between being fired from the derelict's airlock and their ship. Realizing that someone must remain behind to operate the airlock, the psych officer volunteers, acknowledging he's the least important to the mission. The communications officer misses the airlock and floats into space where he is shown freezing over before hitting a portion of the space ship and shattering.  
  
The psych officer enters the derelict's observation room and removes the windows protective tinting, exposing himself to the sun's full force, vaporizing him. As the gentlest and most sympathetic character, this is a good death.  
  
After the ship looses its botanical garden, the primary source of oxygen, to fire, the remaining crew are left with only enough oxygen to support four of the remaining five crew members. The crew decides to kill the navigation officer, who is under constant sedation, and the engineer takes responsibility for the duty, but the nav officer has already committed suicide by slitting his wrist.  
  
The female botanist always appeared more concerned with the health of her plants than for her fellow crew members. She is stabbed in the back by the derelict ship's captain, who boarded the ship in secret, and set the garden on fire. In the end, she's seen with dead eyes looking at the only surviving plant cupped into her hands.  
  
The engineer freezes to death as he climbs into a vat of liquid nitrogen in an attempt to return the malfunctioning computer to operational status. He succeeds but died in the process. As the most morally ambiguous member of the crew, his focus was solely on the mission, despite the human costs.  
  
The final two crew members died as the ship plunged into the sun, while its nuclear payload explodes. The derelict-ship captain's death is more uncertain as he may have died from a fall or from the explosion/dive into the sun.  
  
Burn, freeze, or knife - a consistent theme. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Sunshine* was a very interesting sci-fi movie because it was well cast. I also found a theme in the way the characters were killed off. The characters that are sympathetic for the viewer died by fire, while the characters showing weakness of moral apathy died by freezing. Two died at human hands, and by knife. There is a consistent theme via death throughout the movie. It's a deep movie that asks some interesting questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These quotes come from an [interview](http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view a=1725) done with Judge Thomas B. Griffith. His statement directly contradicts the stand taken on this court issue.  
  
Carter: You served in the legislative branch (as Senate legal counsel), in the executive branch (as an appointee to the Title IX Commission), and you now serve in the judicial branch. Many recent political battles have stemmed from the disputes about the appropriate balance of power among the three branches, and much has been made about the "accountability" of the judiciary. How do you view the role of the judiciary generally, and how would you describe the judicial philosophy of Judge Tom Griffith?  
  
Griffith: I believe that life-tenured judges in the federal judiciary have a very distinct and limited role. They must avoid the temptation to make law or to substitute their own judgment about what is right in any given case for what the people have already decided through legislation or regulation or for what their courts and the Supreme Court have already decided in case law. The role of a judge is to apply the law to the dispute at hand and to avoid the temptation to substitute his or her personal views about what is right.

<TEXT> I agree with your bias opinion concerning NPR, and when I read a news source I pay close attention to the writer's choice of descriptive words and overall tone. A good example is that NPR originally followed right-wing media outlets in calling the Affordable Care Act "Obamacare." By using that term, NPR perpetuated the negative image of the legislation, a mistake it has since worked to correct. I can recognize immediately the bias in an article by focusing on tone and word choice, but visiting multiple media outlets (Reuters, AP, AJE, NYT, WaPo, Slate, The Nation, Scientific American, LA Times, Salon, etc.) offers the most well rounded view.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The early 1900s were years when the political machines on both sides thrived using a patron system. Tammany was a big Democratic political machine in New York but its influence stretched to the White House. Mark Hanna was the big political boss for the Republican party and after Roosevelt left office and Taft took over, Hanna was able to exert considerable control over the presidency. He was aided in this by the Platt machine, and by Roosevelt spending a year abroad big game hunting in Africa. Taft didn't really want to be president, instead wanting to be a member of the Supreme Court. When the promise of advancement to the Supreme Court was dangled in front of Taft, it was like the horse and carrot being led wherever the driver pointed. </TEXT>

A more complete understanding of my view can be found in *My Blue Heaven: Life and Politics in the Working-class Suburbs of Los Angeles, 1920-1965* by Becky Nicolaides. Because working-class suburbs bordered upon mixed race housing, there was more friction among whites and non-whites that eventually erupted in the Watts riots of the 1960s, according to Nicolaides. She describes many of the points you mentioned in your post, such as residents building their homes in a piece-by-piece fashion, and the close proximity to industrial buildings in the neighborhoods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've done a fairly thorough job of making a case for the car's influence on American cities, but there are also other factors that influenced the suburb's rise. Kevin Kruse's book, *White Flight*, describes how race impacted the rise of suburbia by allowing white Americans to escape the city's grip. Red zoning and covenants, made suburban areas more attractive to whites by excluding non-whites as homeowners. The failure of this policy is well documented by Thomas Sugrue in *The Origins of the Urban Crisis*, a superbly researched book about the decline of Detroit. If you would like more reading material about L.A., Allen Scott edited a wonderful book of essays entitled, *The City: Los Angeles and Urban Theory at the End of the Twentieth Century*. It is a thick book, but well worth the read for L.A. residents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You find the truth upsetting, but when I was invited to join this subreddit, it was with the direct intent of providing a level of expertise regarding questions of American history. As for requiring citations, this comes from years of requiring students to prove the thesis under argument. That's what historians do, by standing on the shoulders of giants and recognizing their contributions through citations we set historical precedents that will hopefully lead to the truth. It's just this mindset used by creationists to decry evolution, and the mods buy into it when citationless statements are given as fact because it has a feeling of truthiness. You may continue to take my vocal stance against not trusting uncited sources as rude, but I consider it a prudent practice. However, you did decide that one of my posts was uncited and politically motivated, so there's some hypocrisy going on with your statement.  
  
As for the statement about being downvoted, that was in a q a about making the subreddit more professional and trusted, and I received replies from mods in agreement that directed me to use the report button to alert the mods. I stand by statements about the subjective quality of language, and its ability to "make" people feel an emotion. If something in my language hit a nerve, I would recommend exploring why it made you feel "bad" in order to overcome the offending complex. Finally, the "veiled threat" post was in response to a mod's comment that I not further pursue the matter in question, by suggesting it would get me banned. That is not really a veiled threat, as it's just a threat. I don't consider myself confrontational, but I will defend my position with citations and logic until they are proven wrong. The comment I was banned over was an observation that an event as historically important as the call for war among nations in WWII contained *x* number of comments but no citations. When I last checked, fourteen other redditors agreed with my assessment. Apparently pointing out this inconvenient truth is considered rude. It's also why I expected trouble with r/askhistorians because its mods promote the subreddit as being eminently trustworthy when in fact, Wikipedia requires citations to support a statement or a *citation needed* flag is attached. Conversely, r/askhistorians just shrugs its shoulders and places the burden of trust on the reader, who must ask for a citation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm surprised no one mentioned espionage, but in the field of intelligence gathering, the USSR out-spied the US. This ability allowed the Soviets to produce an atomic weapon in 1949, a far shorter time frame than U.S. intelligence sources predicted. It also gave them a edge during negotiations during and after WWII because recruited sources provided information about where U.S. policy was firm and where it could me manipulated.  
  
In contrast, the majority of foreign agents the U.S. tried to infiltrate into the USSR were captured and killed or placed in Gulags. Stalin's network of spies within country kept a close eye on any foreigners because he distrusted any non-Soviets. WWII Soviet army veterans were also considered untrustworthy by Stalin because of contact with Western decadence and targeted for Gulags, as well.

<TEXT> You don't see the inherent contradiction in providing lifetime appointments based on a blatant falsehood? The selection process for a SCJ requires the appointee be vetted through the legislative branch, which decides on whether the seeker is politically acceptable. The belief that a lifetime appointment automatically creates an impartial judge is laughable when viewed in this context. A quick glance through the court's history on civil liberties reveals that its members followed the ideological tides by supporting both slavery and separate-but-equal laws when any impartial judge, and history itself, would view them as a moral outrage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem. From its very beginnings the SC has been driven by political ideology, and the manipulations of presidents to place like-minded individuals in this seat of power. The case that provided the SC with its power over judicial review is a good example of this. *Marbury v. Madision* hinges on the fight between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans to control the judicial character of the SC. The fight to control the court's ideological makeup continues with each President, the exception being Jimmy Carter (no appointee). Rather than placing a justice above the political fray, a lifetime appointment allows SCJ to "treat the Constitution as a thing of wax, to be molded into any shape the members so desire," as T. Jefferson warned. </TEXT>

Gaining knowledge is a personal journey with results dependent on the individual. A degree from an Ivy school imparts a sense of sophistication and learning earned just via the school's name - a pedigree of sorts. It also means a sheltered understanding of the greater world. The two presidents who didn't attend a top 10 school were Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan. Both presidents had a profound influence on the average American, with Johnson launching the war on poverty, and Reagan redefining the definition of poverty. Is it difficult to recognize the influence education had on these two men? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak to every elected president has shared the urge to institute change, but I can discuss the commonalities of the presidents who were elected in the 20th and 21st centuries.  
  
First, the U.S. elected 18 presidents during this period, and seventeen graduated from college. Only Harry Truman failed to attend college. Fourteen of the seventeen presidents graduated from a school in the nation's top [20 as ranked by U.S. News   World Report.](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/data) An education at these universities costs an average of $43,000 annually.  
  
The complaint that our leaders are out of touch is absolutely correct, as they are educated at elite universities that celebrate exclusiveness. The imbalance on the Supreme Court is even more alarming as 5 Justices are alumni of Harvard Law School, 3 Justices attended Yale Law School, and a single Justice attended Columbia Law School. All three schools are ranked in the top five universities. That's a very narrow scholastic range for such a diverse country, and it results in an elitist point of view. </TEXT>

I made .25 cents hourly, and by the time I left the fields for more traditional employment at 16 years old, I was making $2 per hour. My family didn't own any of the tobacco fields; instead, I worked in a neighbor's fields, or any of the other area growers needing help. I did everything from laying out the seed beds in preparation of the spring planting, to stripping and bundling the leaves for its eventual sale. I once fell off the top rung in a three story barn while hanging the tobacco leaves, freshly cut from the field, and in advance of the firing process that gives the tobacco its brown, cured appearance. Because I was small, I fit well in the small spaces at the barn's roof, but the inside temperature was well in excess of 100 degrees. I passed out and woke up in a bed of tobacco leaves in the tail-bed of a truck. I was told I fell right into the back of the truck, which probably saved my life because the leaves cushioned my fall. The guy I was working for was irritated because it slowed work down. He watched as I drank two big cups of water, and then sent me right back up to the top tier. It's extremely hard work, but the only paying job in the area, at the time. Tennessee labor laws didn't allow a child to begin work until age 16, and even if it allowed for an earlier age, the area was so rural that only tiny country stores offered employment. Additionally, most of those jobs went to the store owners' kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking at the bigger picture, why has the Supreme Court shifted its support of free speech in elections from protecting voters to protecting corporations and large donors? It all begins with precedents and Citizens United set the stage for McCutcheon. More recently, the Court decided to break the barrier between church and state by deciding prayer before government meetings is acceptable.  
  
Taking a closer look at the Justices themselves, five possess law degrees from Harvard, three have law degrees from Yale, and one attended law school at Columbia University. These are among the top five universities in the U.S., with the most millionaire alumni, and a rarefied atmosphere. The cost to earn a law degree from these universities averages $280k, well beyond the financial reach of average Americans.  
  
As for religious convictions, there are six Catholics and three Jews sitting on the court. This doesn't bode well for the pro-choice crowd if another attack on Roe v. Wade takes place. How long will it take corporations to earn religious rights from the court?  
  
We have six men on the court who bring a sense of entitlement to their positions, while the three women offset it with empathy. Most of the court's members have operated within the elite atmosphere populated by the very wealthy, and have lost touch with average American. We should be very afraid of the ideological reach enjoyed by the Supreme Court, and question its pivot in free speech from that of the average American to the wealthy and corporate elites. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The influence of the Supreme Court is overwhelming in American history. I would point you to the Dred Scott case that left an entire population of black Americans in slavery until after the Civil War. Next, I would remind you of the "separate but equal" hogwash in the Plessy decision. Explain to those millions of lives that the Supreme Court has no power and played a limited role in keeping them enslaved.

<TEXT> The Supreme Court has the final say on whether a law is constitutional, and if not, it is struck down. The president and congress can legislate all day but if the law's considered unconstitutional, it is overturned. While the court doesn't have the power of enforcement, it still makes the laws. The U.S. is a nation built on laws, and I can only think of two instances when a president ignored Supreme Court rulings: A. Jackson and the trail of tears, and A. Lincoln and the suspension of habeus corpus during the civil war years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to the readings, it was a failure of the entire system, both regulatory and industry, to protect the investor from buying bad stocks. The number one imperative of a stock broker is to protect its clients from bad investments. The largest investment firms ignored this imperative and pushed stocks they knew were "toxic" on a variety of investors that included city governments, union pension funds, and municipalities.  
  
Fueling this binge was home sales across the U.S., with Country Wide leading the way in offering loans to individuals that in no way qualified. The loans were variable interest that began small and then ballooned into larger payments when the economy dropped and interest rates climbed. Associates were told to expedite loan approvals and ignore or fill in blank spots - anything necessary for loan approval.  
  
Wall Street took these bad loans, cut them into "tranches" that were spread across several stocks to reduce the risks. Ratings agencies provided the stocks with unrealistic ratings, and Wall Street sold them to the world. The stocks were insured, and when the collapse occurred it wiped out the big insurers that paid off the large brokerage houses, leaving nothing for the small investor.  
  
Goldman Sachs role is particularly heinous because it sold massive numbers of these toxic (the word appeared consistently throughout all nine books I read) stocks, and then bet against them on the market. The amount of money this firm made off of the misery of the poor is pornographic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure examples of casual clothing abound throughout history, but my favorite is that of Thomas Jefferson. When Senator William Plumer arrived to meet Jefferson at the President's House in Washington, D.C. on 1802, the president was "dressed, or rather undressed, with an old brown coat, red waist-coat, old corduroy small clothes, much soiled, wooled hose and slippers without heels." Imagine the uproar in contemporary media if a president conducted business dressed this way.

I read all the books on this list up to #9, which I considered the best book, and all the authors detailed how investment and banking firms used poorly regulated methods to basically con home buyers into financing/refinancing loans. Sadly, the authors contribute the lack of criminal prosecutions to an unwillingness by the government to prosecute the offenders. If you want to understand the crisis, read the books on this list.

<TEXT> Many civil war historians aver that by passing the 13th amendment, northerners believed southern slaves would desert or turn on their masters and create additional turmoil and fear. A persistent fear experienced by a large portions of southerners during the antebellum period was that the slave population would participate in an uprising. Nat Turner's rebellion and John Brown's raid both played on these fears and were fresh in their minds when the 13th amendment was ratified.

<TEXT> As for the number of presidents who grew up wealthy, I researched the individuals elected during the 20th and 21st centuries, and where they attended college. Of the 18 presidents, 14 attended a top ten ranked university where tuition and lodging costs far exceed the national average. Only three of the 18 attended small public schools - Warren Harding (Ohio Central College), Lyndon Johnson (Southwest Texas State Teachers College), and Ronald Reagan (Eureka College). Harry Truman is the only president serving in the 20th and 21st century who did not attend college.  
  
The remaining fourteen presidents attended Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton, Columbia, and Amherst. I realize it is unfair to generalize an individual's economic standing by alumni status, but to successfully reach the position of president contemporarily requires attending a school that provides a degree with a pedigree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Journalists weren't the only individuals filming the war, as some soldiers brought along their own equipment. A good example of this is Robert Fuller, a Hollywood director who served as an infantry soldier with the 1st Infantry Division. Fuller carried an 8mm Bell   Howell camera with him while storming Omaha Beach on DDay; he earned a Silver Star on that day helping to open a hole on the German line, and when communications went down, making an insane dash across open sand to inform his commander. Fuller said he preferred the B H because it was rugged and handled wet, cold conditions well. He filmed the Battle of the Bulge, and near the end of the war, the liberation of Falkenau Concentration Camp in Czechoslovakia. I saw portions of this film while doing research at Huntington Library, and it shows the citizens of the city next to the camp - man, woman, and child - being forced to walk through the camp and view the human carnage. He filmed as his unit forced locals to collect the dead bodies littering the camp, and give them proper burials that included a funeral procession.

I don't know if this info helped but you might also consider looking into George Stevens, another Hollywood director and cameraman who was assigned by the military to film the war. Like Fuller, he filmed DDay landings, but from a greater distance. He also filmed numerous concentration camp atrocities that were used during the Nuremberg trials; the footage was also placed in the Library of Congress. I'm sorry to say my notes don't tell me what camera he used.

<TEXT> I commend you for reaching out here to collect topic suggestions. I wish this source had been available when I was a graduate student. I find my best writing occurs when I connect the past to the present by asking questions related to interesting topics. Lately, I've asked myself how S.C. justices have evolved during the court's tenure? For instance, much is written about the legislative and federal branches of government, but the Supreme Court's influence is often overlooked except in extreme cases such as *Dred Scott*. This is just an example of how to generate ideas, but I also suggest you keep in mind the availability and accessibility of primary resources. In order to do part of my thesis, I was forced to travel to UCLA and the Huntington Library, because they housed a generous number of archived film from Hollywood's early years. The greater number of primary sources available makes for a stronger, reasoned thesis analysis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My studies on race, urban, and media history has profoundly changed the way I view American society. Understanding media's role in the "red scare" and government's response to socialism, along with its fight against labor, allow me to understand the world I live in today. If we include Cold War history, almost the entire 20th century history in the U.S. revolves around the battle between two disparate economic ideologies - socialism and capitalism.  
  
The battle between these two ideologies touched every U.S. citizen in some manner, but the greatest burden fell on the nation's poor. Detroit is a good example of what happens to a city when it ignores the plight of the poor, while concentrating on the wealthy. Thomas Sugrue, *The Origins of the Urban Crisis : Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit* provides a chilling history of this event. Moreover, I don't understand why more historians don't become angry over the repeated examples of government's ill treatment of the poor.

<TEXT> Not if you've defined yourself out of poverty. The current economic system in the U.S. is not designed to alleviate poverty. Capitalism is an economic system deeply dependent on the ideology that it selects winners and losers impartially, but this just isn't the case. Americans believe that if they own *x, y, or z*, they must be in the middle-class. Ask yourself, "If I lost my job today, could I go six months without unemployment benefits, while maintaining my current lifestyle? Do I have enough saved for retirement that one minor emergency (medical?) doesn't wipe out my entire funds?" If you answered 'no', then you aren't really in the middle class. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am, however, educated in determining social classes. I don't just limit my definition of social class to economics. To be firmly in the American middle-class, I argue, the individual/family has sufficient income from a paycheck to place a portion into savings or the stock market after paying the monthly bills. They own a home, with multiple cars, and can afford to send their children to a state college without student loans. Credit card use is for the sake of convenience, and not because it's needed. If an individual/family lives paycheck-to-paycheck, the future is the now and offers little hope for advancement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I believe you're trying to ask is why the "other" or "outsider" in the U.S. was identified as such, and how/why this changed? For the purposes of this answer, I define anyone who is not white or of Anglo descent as the "other".  
  
In the nation's history, black Americans have occupied the position of "other" for almost its entirety. The defining characteristics of African Americans popular in antebellum America changed after the Civil War when they gained agency through economic and educational growth. In the southern states, new laws restricted this development for AA's, allowing many negative stereotypes to persist.  
  
Source: 1. Richard Valelly, The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004).  
  
The evolution of the Irishman also developed during this period, as many were taken straight of the boat at Ellis Island and placed directly into the Union Army. Back home, the Irish were fighting for independence from England and many came to the U.S. to gain military experience that they could take home to Ireland. As the U.S. experienced the second industrial revolution, and urban populations exploded, the Irish earned greater acceptance in relation to AA's and Eastern European immigrants. Irish immigrants told friends they learned 3 things about America. First, the streets weren't paved with gold. Second, the streets weren't paved, period. Third, the Irish were expected to pave the streets.  
  
Source: 1. Mitchell Snay, Fenians, Freedmen, and Southern Whites: Race and Nationality in the Era of Reconstruction (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007).  
  
As for the additional races and their acceptance, the best way to gain validity as a U.S. citizen was to buy a house. The reasons for this are many, including: it meant the individual was invested in the nation; owning a home required steady employment; homeowners were less likely to be radicals.

<TEXT> According to Cold War historians, the American leaders viewed the rearmament of the West Germans as a mainly symbolic gesture to reassure Europeans that all NATO members shared in the defense against communist aggression. The French and Russians were greatly alarmed at the thought of a militarized reunified Germany, and to allay these fears required the aforementioned stationing of U.S. troops in Germany. The U.S. viewed Germany as a temporary speed bump so devastated and wearied by the war that it stood little chance of slowing down a Russian offensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realize now that my remarks seem a little harsh, but describing the Soviet Army as a juggernaut seems disingenuous, even for the Soviet experts that populated the period's State Department. Although historians describe the U.S. and U.S.S.R. as the only two superpowers standing, the reality is that the U.S. experienced economic growth without the disastrous wreckage that haunted the Soviets, and in truth was the only real superpower. Stalin admitted that his country and people were tired and needed at least ten years to recover. The rearmament of Germany took place during the later Eisenhower administration, after U.S. policymakers switched from the ideology of containment pushed by George Kennan, to one of brinkmanship or massive retaliation sponsored by Dulles. This change meant that the military response to aggression became only one of a multitude of possible responses, with the atomic option becoming the overriding U.S. strategy.

<TEXT> First, there was no "Soviet juggernaut" waiting to push through Europe and the ideology belongs to the Traditionalism history espoused by W.E. Griffith or T.T. Hammond, according to Chris Ward, author of *Stalin's Russia*.  
  
Revisionist historians such as J.L. Gaddis and R.C. Raack acknowledge the devastation inflicted on Russia by the Germans, but that Stalin hid the nation's weakness with oratory bluster and demonstrations of technological prowess (Sputnik, hydrogen bomb). The U.S. State Department lacked the personnel to properly evaluate the Soviet Union because of the Red Scare and McCarthy's accusations which resulted in the department losing a huge number of analyists.

As to the original question, Germany was rearmed because U.S. leadership believed it was a necessary deterrent, but the French demanded that the Germans host American soldiers as a means of keeping the German Army from reemerging as a threat.

<TEXT> The main cause for America's transition from isolationism is contained in NSC-68, a National Security Council document written for Truman that described the global threats facing the US. Released on April 7, 1950, its primary authors, Paul Nitze, Dean Acheson, and Chip Bohlen declared that to protect the free world from communist aggression, the US must abandon any plans for slipping back into isolationism. It recommended a substantial increase in defense spending that included growing the military's strength and investments in missile delivery systems for nuclear weapons. Two months after the document's release the Korean War broke out, lending credence to the writers' predictions about communism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an American historian who knows 1950's films intimately, I would suggest you research about the change in the movie industry during this period from a vertically integrated studio model to the now familiar producer/director model. The federal government deemed the old studio model as too monopolistic because studios owned the film process from the creation of a film to its final viewing in the theater. If the city you live in has a Paramount theater, it's because the studio once owned that theater.  
  
You can see the change in film during the 1950s because directors suddenly had more influence in their work. A good example is *Shane*, directed by George Stevens, in which the gun is no longer considered in heroic terms, instead becoming the last line of defense for a good man.  
  
Films addressing Cold War fears began appearing around this time, and Sam Fuller's *Pick Up on South Street* documents this superbly using characters such as a pickpocket and a prostitute to thwart a communist plan to steal atomic secrets.  
  
Science-fiction movies also appeared regularly during the period with the original *War of the Worlds* directed by Byron Haskins. The special effects work he pioneered on this film helped set the stage for Star Trek.

All three films debuted just weeks apart during 1953, but each owed its production to the shift from a studio system to the director/producer model.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took a seminar on the history of Los Angeles that included an examination of its success relative to San Diego and San Francisco. L.A.'s overshadowing of San Diego rests on a number of factors. First, the fight over the terminus of the intercontinental railroad, and which towns in California received regular service; L.A. won this battle. Next, the two cities battled over becoming the port destination for import and export; L.A. won this battle, as well. Finally, when William Mulholland stole the water rights from Owen Valley and diverted it to L.A., the lushness it brought to the nearby California valleys made the city more attractive than arid San Diego.

The first time I've encountered explicit mention of the U.S. providing aid is during the Marshall Plan, and it was seen as a way of influencing the political outcomes in Greece and Italy. We now provide financial aid to a large number of countries, and threaten to withhold funds when countries behave badly, but I'm trying to discover when this strategy became a policy for the government.

<TEXT> Most of the posted comments provide good information, but I'd suggest narrowing your subject matter to specific areas. Instead of writing a historiography of WWII, examine writings about the Battle of the Bulge; instead of the Cold War, write about the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Berlin Air Resupply missions. The tighter your paper's focus, the better it'll appear to a reader. Finally, always approach your readings by focusing on the differences between authors' approaches or methods. In many ways you're writing a series of book reviews on a single historical event. If you need help choosing the books to include in your historiography, begin with the most contemporary historian's writing on the subject and use his/her bibliography to identify the historical works they relied upon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the best sources to answer this question comes from Lisle Rose. He described early public reaction to nuclear testing as popular, and that people flocked to the desert to watch tests. As for the health ramifications caused by radiation, the U.S. government was well aware of its dangers, even to the extent that it barred newspaper reporters and photographers not approved by the government from visiting Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The public didn't really become aware of the danger from radiation until after Japanese fishermen working in the area of the Bikini Atoll tests became sick and the news went public.

<TEXT> The term "shell shock" refers to a condition that VA mental health professionals now call PTSD. The term first came about during WWI and its aftermath when soldiers exhibited symptoms such as uncontrollable shaking, fugues, and panic induced by loud noises. After intense periods of enemy shelling, a spike rose in soldiers reporting these symptoms leading health officials to use the term "shell shock." Doctors blamed the concussive blasts from the shelling for the symptoms and believed it was a physical problem, overcome by simply resting.  
  
As the science of mental health improved over the century, doctors recognized the symptoms as a mental disorder that could be controlled with proper care.

<TEXT> I cannot address Taft's role in trust busting, however, Theodore Roosevelt's reasons for going after these entities were based on his close relationship with both the environment and the American people. As a child, Roosevelt collected animal, insect, and plant specimens for classification in his many journals and diaries. During his college years, he left school to mourn the death of his first wife, moving out west to start a cattle ranch. He formed close relationships with migrants who settled on undeveloped land, and understood the daily struggle these people faced. The most pernicious obstacle for these settlers was the large corporations and railroads that simply took resources from the settlers' lands without compensation. When Roosevelt became an "accidental president" after the assassination of McKinley, he seized the opportunity to protect the environment and American citizens from unfair trust practices by setting aside huge swaths of land as national parks for future generations. Once called a "traitor to his class" by the wealthy trust owners, Roosevelt was considered a hero by his fellow citizens.

<TEXT> Americans attributed the loss of China to the Truman administration and its backlash swept Eisenhower and the Republicans back into power after almost 2 decades of Democratic party rule. Communism was tightly wound together with the U.S. social and labor movements of the early 20th century, and it was greatly feared because of its challenge to democracy and capitalism. This is a recurring theme in John Gaddis' *The Cold War a new history* and *We now know: rethinking Cold War history*, in which Mao first reached out to the U.S. for help before being rebuffed, causing the Chinese turn to Russia. Lisle Rose describes the political climate of the 1950s in *The Cold War comes to Main Street : America in 1950.* Stalin's efforts to consolidate Russia's satellite nations were brutal, and this played on Americans' fears of an outbreak of war that included nuclear warfare. Eisenhower's reputation as a military leader, and the Republican Party's sable-rattling, signaled confidence to a frightened country that it believed Democrat's lacked. </TEXT>

Dems feared that if the U.S. lost Vietnam, Republicans would recapture majorities in both houses and the presidency.

One of the sites I operated from was run by the NSA, and located in an allied country where we collected and analyzed satellite and missile telemetry from hostile nations. At this site, the analysts were guarded by armed MPs, and the equipment was rigged with self-destruct explosives in the event of a foreign military attack. To complete the destruction, two f16s from a nearby airbase remained on daily alert to bomb the site so that nothing remained for the enemy to use. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many authors who discuss race and the immigrant's path to acceptance as a member of the "white race", but David Roediger's *Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White* is probably the most concise. As one commenter mentioned without going into detail, the process was related to economic and political power. An individual gained access through attaining a steady, well-paying job, but the best means was by purchasing land and building a house, or buying a preexisting house. According to Roediger, these two conditions signaled to the community at large that the individual held a stake in the nation's continuing success. The most problematic "whites" were the Jews because of the rampant antisemitism both in the U.S. and abroad, but even they could be accepted if they satisfied the job and house provision. Asians and blacks were excluded from this process by the National Association of Realtors which instituted a system of "red lining". The institution used signed covenants to restrict homeowners within a community from selling their homes to African-Americans or any other minority the community deemed unwelcome. On Realtor maps these areas were outlined using red, thus the term "red lining."  For more information here is a list of books:

<TEXT> I was a TA for Eve Kornfeld, a prominent historian a pre-colonial and colonial American, and she explained the gendered immigration patterns of early settlers as a result of economic interests. She said the Virginia area became a focus of interest for British companies that were searching for new sources of raw materials. These companies would advertise for men by espousing the New World as a means of new opportunities and wealth. They offered to pay the individuals way via ship and provide them with food, and in return the individual would labor honestly and without trouble for six years. When the six years passed, the individual was given a plot of land and the means necessary to make it prosper. When the individual arrived in Virginia, a local would buy his contract from the British company, and the man would now work for a new employer for the six years. If his new employer accused him of being difficult, he could add more time to the contract.
New immigrants to the Northern U.S. were mostly families because they were moving to escape religious persecution. They came to the new world as a family unit, and encouraged settlement as a family unit. The individual's life expectancy was also very short during this period and the new world's appetite for new immigrants remained constant. I hope this explanation helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a wonderful book by Timothy Egan called *The Big Burn* that talks about the birth of the U.S. Forestry Service and T. Roosevelt's role in setting aside land for the national forest. It details the huge forest fire of 1910 that spread across Washington, Idaho, and Michigan, and how the newly appointed forest rangers and volunteers battled to fight the fire. One of the tidbits I found interesting was that Ed Polaski, a forest ranger, invented the axe that all modern firefighters now carry but never received any financial gain because he didn't patent the design. As a result of the 1910 fire, Polaski lost all the sight in one eye, and damage to the other eye left his vision blurry. The saddest portion of the book details the lack of social and medical support the rangers received after risking their lives. The men were forced to pay their own medical bills and none of them received pensions or disability payments. Because of their injuries, many suffered financial ruin and died poor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> in virtually every book i've read on this subject, stalin's need for an american invasion of france was to force germany to shift resources away from the russian front, and relieve pressure on the russian military. as the winter took its toll on germany the need became less pressing, but stalin still continued to insist on the invasion.
another rarely mentioned fact is that the japanese 5th army was amassed on the chinese/soviet border. because japan and russia were members of a non-aggression pact signed in 1905 (T. Roosevelt won a nobel prize for mediating this), stalin knew this border was safe. the japanese were terrified the russians would enter the war against them, and would probably have surrendered before the bomb drop on hiroshima (stated by: arnold, leahy, macarthur, eisenhower). i've always asked myself why truman didn't drop the bomb as a demonstration on the japanese army amassed across the border from russia? it was a military target and the demonstration would reveal to both russia and japan the bomb's power. the arms race would probably have still occurred, but there might have been less animosity between the russia and the u.s. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I once took a seminar on the history of modern germany - bismark to adenauer
In regards to hitler, my prof. offered two factors he felt were decisive for the nazis to gain power. first, the radio was employed to disseminate a constant stream of pro-nazi propaganda. he said that every home in germany was required to have a radio, and if it wasn't on, the homeowners were regarded with suspicion and reported to the authorities. second, the concentration camps began as a political tool used to scare local social-democrats and communists within the population. this soon expanded to include religious leaders and newspaper writers/editors/owners. many of the individuals swallowed up in the camps were later released and the stories they told about the camps were positive.  at the time, many of the camps were located in secluded, forested areas where the local populations rarely encountered it. most germans, he stated, were simply happy they weren't imprisoned in one. as the camps evolved and became more closely associated with jewish imprisonment, they were ignored by the population. in the nazi party's early days, these camps were full of political prisoners, and the mere thought of ending up in one kept the population from supporting the party's opponents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only speak to the seminars that I've been directly involved in, and it may vary from institution to institution. A history seminar will delve deeply into the history of a subject, location, or even ideology, among many other things. For example, a seminar on the history of Los Angeles would require a number of core books about the city's social, economic, political, and physical history for the student to read weekly/biweekly. Additionally, the student is assigned a book from the list to review. Book reviews are generally 6-10 pages and focus on where the book fits within 1) its historiography, 2) the author's citations and historical methodology, 3) the argument's strengths and weaknesses, 4) and what the author's argument adds to the historiography. The instructor will also offer subjects for deeper historical inspection that relate to the course, and the student is assigned a 20-30 page paper to respond. The seminar generally meets weekly to discuss assignments and the readings, and I always found it the most interesting portion because my fellow students often noticed things that I did not, thus expanding my knowledge. Anyway, the gist of it is there's a lot of reading and writing involved, but if you love history, a seminar's the best thing since sliced bread. </TEXT>

I've encountered much of the information Alperovitz documents but it came from secondary resources that had written about the bombings. His research appears sound, the citations are many and speak to the incident at hand, but he also identifies areas where the information has changed or was incomplete. You argued in another thread that his thesis was popular in the 1990s, but that was no longer the case. What do you believe is incorrect about his work, and the thesis that the bomb, while dropped on Japan, was meant as a political tool for use against Russia? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firebombing a city entailed massive numbers of planes and bombs, and took a number of hours to effect what the military would call a success. The A-bomb required one plane and one bomb that acted with immediate destruction rendering the possibility of survival virtually nonexistent. Everyone understood the destructive potential of this weapon and its political implication for future generations. If you can gain access to Time's and Harper's archives, the contemporary articles clearly articulate the pulse of the world after the bomb's drop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate your input, but I caution you against "taking yourself" back in time as you study the bomb's history, and by that I mean believing our contemporary attitudes were shared by those living in 1945. We have lived with the knowledge of nuclear weapons for over 65 years, and its depictions in numerous films, television shows, documentaries, and video games lead to a disconnect with its actual danger, but in 1945, a force as powerful as these two weapons simply didn't exist. For nations at war, the understanding that one bomb could wipe out entire armies, was both awe inspiring and frightening. Articles in Time, Harpers, The New York Times, and other news sources in the U.S. and overseas immediately address this weapon's implications on war and politics, and the paradigm shift this meant for the world at large. As for who wouldn't want to see the bomb drop? Just about the entire military and scientific community who had witnessed the test drop or were briefed on its results. Within the naval command, Leahy and MacArthur both stated there unhappiness over the bombs and targets because they considered it an almost cowardly act against a civilian population. And while the destruction of cities was commonplace during this period, the ability to do it with one bomb was not imagined. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are mounds of declassified documents, but there's a reason they're classified as such. And, while some documents released earlier to researchers still had large portions redacted, more complete versions have been released which call into question the accepted understanding of the roles and attitudes of those involved in the decision. The military command's involvement in the decision was based on the intelligence at hand and what they were seeing on the ground. The navy commanders in charge of the blockade of Japan reported that the enemy was completely unable to resupply and predicted it would sue for peace by December, 1945. Hap Arnold stated in Time magazine a mere 11 days after the event that the Japanese were already beaten and dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary.
I do, however, appreciate your input and the listing of another book that I can pour through. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't know there was an Alperovitz thesis. My knowledge comes from reading Gaddis, Lytle, Zubok and Pleshakov, and other cold war historians whose stances have shifted on the bomb decision issue over the years. Probably the most damning material for what Truman knew about Japan's attempts at peace overtures comes from the declassified MAGIC intercepts. This information, combined with newly released classified documents paints a very different picture of the decision. Another point that has become clear over time is that Stimson was far removed from the decision making process at both Potsdam and for the bomb. This is verified repeatedly by his own diary and from the personal papers of those involved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with the narrative of a "perfect storm of justifications" is that it doesn't fit with the historical record of the event that continues to contemporaneously evolve as more formerly classified material is released, along with the diaries of primary participants that were withheld from publication by request (25-50 yrs.). The information Truman had from his military was that Japan was on its last legs because of the blockade. The U.S. controlled the skies above Japan because the country was out of fuel, and the pilots were rapidly running out of targets on the mainland to bomb. They urged a clarification of the "unconditional surrender" term that assured the Japanese people that their Emperor wouldn't be harmed. They also believed an invasion of Japan wasn't necessary because Allied bombing had completely destroyed the country's ability to manufacture munitions, and the blockade denied it the raw materials for production. Eisenhower was particularly vocal, especially after encountering the Red Army in Europe, and witnessing its decrepitude, that U.S. forces could operate without a declaration of war from Russia. The number of high-ranking military officials who supported a demonstration of the weapon prior to its use is overwhelming. A number of these same officials later said that more American lives could've been saved, and the war shortened, if Truman had simply clarified "unconditional surrender", which was the only sticking point to Japan's surrender. The idea that Japan refused to surrender is a fallacy, and the record is filled with these attempts. The Emperor became personally involved in these attempts during June, 1945, and a MAGIC intercept details his attempt to meet with the King of Sweden, who as an royal personage could broker the terms of surrender with the U.S. The OSS chief in Sweden, William "Wild Bill" Donovan, confirmed the effort but Truman told him not to pursue it. That's why the decision to drop the bomb makes such a compelling mystery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The conspiracy isn't about building the bomb, it's about Truman's decision to use the bomb. His decision to drop the A-bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki fits all the parameters of a conspiracy. Did he authorize the drop because it would end the war quickly and save American soldiers' lives, or was it because the entire Red Army was amassed across Eastern Europe and Germany's defeat freed up soldiers to shift to the Asian sphere of battle, leaving western Europe defenseless? Regarding the latter question, a demonstration of the A-bomb sent a clear message to Stalin that the U.S. now had the capability to offset a large land army with superior technology. However, this is only one area of inquiry. Who influenced Truman's decision-making process? Why were Japanese peace overtures ignored? Why was a Russian declaration of war against Japan pursued so vigorously at the onset of May-July, 1945, and then abandoned after the Potsdam Conference? It was generally believed by all parties involved that a declaration of war by Russia would force the capitulation of Japan without the necessity of a U.S. invasion. Why did Truman refuse to define the term "unconditional surrender" so that the Japanese people understood it didn't mean the death of their Emperor? Despite calls from the American media, Churchill, the U.S. legislature, and all his military commanders to clearly outline for the Japanese people what surrender would entail, Truman remained evasive on the issue. If a historian wants a really good conspiracy, it's the decision to use the bomb.  </TEXT>

Based on the accounts of scientists who viewed the first atomic explosion, the overall emotion felts among them was awe at its power. Japan's government had already sent out diplomatic feelers among the Russians to broker a peace deal with the Americans.

George Stevens and Byron Haskin both began their careers as camera operators around 1910, before becoming directors; in their biographies, both men discuss at length about the extended shooting schedules that California offered, as well as the variety of landscape. Montana was considered as a suitable replacement for California, but its weather and short summer left the state at a disadvantage. I cannot comment on the reason for New York's success in American theater. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a good reason for Churchill's quote about the Britain being able to survive. Lynne Olson's book *Those Angry Days* describes the fight between isolationists and interventionists before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. We like to see the Lend Lease program as a crutch for Britain, but in actuality it didn't provide much support for the British because American military leaders were unwilling to release equipment they believed would be necessary for U.S. defense in the immediate future. Roosevelt was hesitant to go against public opinion, and the isolationists were extremely vocal and led by a number of groups, the most influential being America First, which touted Lindbergh as a member. Olson describes Britain as being on the edge of collapse and encircled by the Germans. Hitler, meanwhile, has given orders to his navy not to menace any U.S. ships. He avoided at all costs bringing the U.S. into the war, but after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, he waited a period longer before declaring war on the U.S. Olson also claimed Roosevelt wanted a declaration of war from Germany to strengthen his own political position in asking congress for a declaration of war. Churchill and his interventionist guests, which he described as fairly dancing, were so very happy because they knew America's business interests would now support war, and the trickle of war materials would now become a flood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cannot comment on the first era (1920), but Stalin's reaction to the German invasion and Winter War is documented by his daughter, who said he sequestered himself in isolation and wept out of fear. She described him as being unsure of his leadership skills, and that he felt vulnerable to his many political enemies. All of this is documented in Zubok and Pleshakov's book *Inside the Kremlin's Cold War*. Applebaum writes of Stalin's deep distrust of the Polish military and underground and his vicious purges after gaining control of the country in her writings about the Gulag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We spent a week on studying and understanding the different historical methodologies during one of my early history seminars, and post-modernism was by far the most complicated. One of the books we read was Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*, but I deal mainly with film historians who specialize in post-modern methodology. My greatest complaint is that the pm methodology create these very long, sometimes confusing argument, and then give it a shorter label, before using it again to support another argument. In short, it appeared to be a form of verbal gymnastics employed to prop up an argument when proof wasn't readily available. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The anti-registration contingent argues about this fear of having their guns taken because they'll be left without protection. The government doesn't want peoples' guns because they have so many better toys with which to reap destruction; and if they wanted your gun, they could take it, along with the owner. Protesting the drone strikes that killed an U.S. citizen, the closing of Guantanamo, the use of torture, or the warrant-less wiretaps are all equally important, but gun advocates only want to protect the 2nd amendment and toss the rest out. Asking gun owners to register their weapons and instituting improved background checks is not unreasonable, and anyone paranoid about the government taking their gun is probably not that stable in the first place. If an individual is obeying the law, and living within it, they have nothing to fear. You may have the final word because I'm finished with arguing about "what might happen" in some paranoid's world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it comes down to making your life a little harder in order to save lives, that's simply a no-brainer. Asking people to register and pass a background check before purchasing a weapon in no way inhibits an individual from owning a gun. If that person passes the background check, no problem, they get the gun; but, if that person fails the check, it may stop a mass shooting. The straw-man in the argument for 2nd amendment enthusiasts is that registering puts them on some kind of list. This kind of fortunetelling leads to conspiracy theories and worries that the government will take away guns. As for being on a list, the number of things that necessitate registration are almost too numerous to count: boating, hunting, school, children, vehicle, home, pet, rv, motorcycle, political party, etc..

The government knows enough about its population without having to worry about whether you have a weapon. In fact, the information government has on the population probably includes whether or not the individuals is willing to use said gun. Again, registering a weapon and passing background checks in no way infringes on the right to purchase or own a gun. </TEXT>

I know this suggestion is thoroughly repulsive, but as a photojournalist, I understand the visceral reaction to a photo, and the power contained within.

However, Lockheed's board of directors and ceo take home outstanding paychecks. They live in gated communities, fly from place to place, and often park their funds in accounts that are beyond the government's purview. Meanwhile, the industry that they control uses national resources that they pay for at a reduced rate, while simultaneously receiving subsidies. In addition, they employ armies of accountants to insure they receive every tax-break available. Every time I see masses of semi-trucks barreling down the road, or delivery vehicles (UPS, etc.) on the street, I know they're wearing on the roadway more than my car. Shouldn't their taxes be tied to the amount of national resources for which they demand? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's just my point, you don't possess the necessary knowledge without my explaining it to you. I can tell you that two centuries earlier, the idea of working for a wage was ludicrous because the world - Britain excepted - still operated on a market economy. Barter remained common for all goods and services. A worker either apprenticed themselves to learn a trade, or they labored in agriculture for a sustenance living.

One century earlier, the average laborer worked 12-14 hour days, six days a week, in incredibly dirty dangerous conditions. If he/she worked in a factory, there were no safety precautions taken and if the worker threatened to strike, he/she was replaced by a more willing worker, or a black laborer. By black laborer, I'm including Sicilians, Greeks, East Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and Mexicans, because each race was considered "black" on some level. The laws covering this labor fell under the "freedom of contract" clause, meaning if you agreed to work for a wage, you did whatever the boss demanded regardless of danger or long hours.

The reason our food server was able to draw attention to this incident is because of the advances in work conditions made possible by labor unions. We now have 8 hour work days and laws requiring overtime pay; we work five day weeks; if an employer is at fault for bodily injury, they now have to pay; child labor is no longer acceptable in the US; employers are required to give breaks. The list goes on-and-on, but it offers the historical precedence that allowed this food server to speak up and actually be heard. It is also a system that employers hate because it restricts them from taking more-for-less from the employee. Republicans would love to rollback the advances made in labor as we've witnessed in numerous political battles across the nation (Wisconsin, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee).

I've given you ideas that any American historian immediately recognizes, but you don't want a list of "unqualified sources." Perhaps you don't like reading, but the list of sources I offer are peer reviewed university press books published by Harvard, Cambridge, Princeton, Duke, and again the list goes on. Let me finish by saying that *ideas* are wonderful things, but unless supported by real research and testing, they remain ideas until proven, or they slip into the realm of fantasy. If you still want the historiography, I'm happy to send it, but now I'm at the point of wasting my time. If you want to know more, attend one of my lectures, or perhaps at a class closer to where you live. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How a person behaves is absolutely dependent on historic precedence. The very fact that we're having a spirited argument on the relevancy of an individual's work behavior is proof positive of historical precedence. Were we to be having this discussion even a century earlier, it would be about the benefits of socialism. Go back even two decades, and the very idea of working for a wage in America would be greeted with disdain. Understanding the social, political, and economic history of the United States is absolutely necessary for me to know where I fit in this society's complicated structure, and for that historical precedence is absolutely necessary. </TEXT>

Our history is littered with examples of small and large businesses behaving badly, such as big tobacco and its "breach of trust" by a lowlife with no "professional integrity" that offered proof that "potentially harmed his employer," but ultimately broke the industries stranglehold on the country's cigarette use. The small business employer is no less culpable in displaying that "professional integrity" when placing the public or its employees at risk. My argument is that we need to worry less about "professional integrity" and demonstrate more personal integrity, which I believe the food server displayed in this case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sadly, you won't be the only misguided individual to agree with corporate America. However, when an individual claims a special relationship with the world at large - in this case a pastor - and they betray that trust by behaving badly or abusing that special relationship ("I give 10% to god" bullshit), then they also deserve every instance of disdain being heaped upon them. It took personal courage for this food server to defend a wronged fellow server, and it cost her the job. Does the average American worker possess this level of courage? IMHO the answer is no. The average US citizen has noted the treatment of whistle-blowers in society (wikileaks, enhanced interrogation) and decided to sit out any future fights, so when someone with the courage to step up appears, I'm firmly behind them. If your ultimate argument is that the food server broke the rules, and deserved the consequences, I'm arguing that the rules are there so that the average person doesn't have to think. If, as a person, I'm happy to have someone else do the thinking for me, then I've earned the society I live within. The food server picked her battle, but who really lost? I guarantee that the fallout among the restaurant's corporate leaders and the pastor's followers far exceeds losing a crappy food server job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've spent a good majority of my life waiting tables while earning two undergrads and a graduate degree, but never worked for Applebees. In fact, that crappy restaurant chain is the walmart of the restaurant world, and only a small step up from Denny's. Stories abound in the server's universe about the reputation of a restaurant chain. Olive Garden is a chain whose food is so inferior that servers warn other servers not to eat there. There are restaurants with reputations for not hiring minorities. I worked as a server/bartender at a M S seafood restaurant for almost seven years; during that period, the restaurant only employed one black server, and then only for less than a month. In the kitchen, we had a single black cook who lasted for less than a year. Perhaps our M S location was the extreme and not the standard, but it followed closely with the restaurant's corporate reputation for not hiring minorities. Within the "waiting world," the religious fucks were always the hardest to serve because they generally demanded more perfection and were the least forgiving. Any food server dreads working on a Sunday, because the 'GOD SQUAD' or 'JESUS FREAKS' invade restaurants at the same hours. The average server leaves a sunday shift exhausted, frustrated, angry, and underpaid. The religious nuts are only one small portion of the dining population that demanded more for less. The infrequent diner is another of these creatures who appear on Christmas or Thanksgiving days. These diners believe every aspect of the meal should be mistake free, and servers heartily agree that the meal should arrive on time and and in perfect condition, but we live in a world where mistakes occur, particularly when more than one individual is involved in the process. The frequent diner understands this aspect of the restaurant experience, but the infrequent diner often expects perfection or the meal is free. There are other diners, the real scumbags, who use complaints as a means for the free meal, but in the end the server is just the middleman left to apologize for the kitchen, bar, and hostess staff who see the customer for only brief moments. If your defense of the customer is "they're always right," let me be the first to say "fuck you," and downvote away. The customer is correct less than half the time, but even if they are correct, it doesn't give them the right to attack the server's dignity. One of the reasons eating out on a date remains popular is because the experience offers a couple the opportunity to observe how a potential mate treats someone else. It's like the bumper sticker, you learn right away what a person thinks about society at large. If you're a dick to a food server while part of a group, you can bet the other people you're dining with take note. In this case, a fellow food server drew a line in the sand, and lost her job, but she left Applebees with her dignity intact, and having learned a lesson that's commonly known in the industry - some restaurants only want smiling robots that are willing to endure a tongue lashing and nasty notes.

By the way, if this short note offended you, then good; you were my target audience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason my dad could raise seven kids was because he worked two jobs, however, one of those jobs was in the steel industry and it paid a living wage for a family of three. The second job was at night with Kmart and paid minimum wage. Our family remained poor, and qualified for government food assistance, but dad just wouldn't accept it. He also refused to allow any of us kids to sign up for school lunches. Today, it's impossible to raise a family on minimum wage, and the jobs available don't pay nearly enough to cover a family's cost of living. As a result, more families are turning to credit cards to supplement the paycheck. Even with both spouses working, the contemporary American family can't keep up with the month-to-month bills, and the constant debt and long work hours, coupled with an uncertain job market, have suppressed the will to protest against unfair wages. With the average worker's wage in stagnation, and the manufacturers' war against labor unions, employers are rolling back many of the advances made by labor during the 20th century. The average working-class employee is now a wage slave who is so deeply in credit card and school loan debt that the very idea of owning a home and having children remains too far in the distant future to warrant making plans. While wages in the financial and political sectors continue to adjust with the cost of living, the salaries in retail and the service industry have remained stagnant since 1972. In short, stagnate wages are the reason for the decline in the middle class and the chasm between the rich and poor in America. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to approach my answer from a media historian's viewpoint that you may find unpopular, but the reason the violence in that film appears so tame is that as a society, we've become more accustomed to scenes of brutal violence. Contemporary film censors allow a vast amount of violence into film in relation to that of the 1970s. A film with only a moderate amount of violence, say a LOTR film, would have received an X rating for violence from a 1970s-era censor, who would consider the battle scenes as too graphic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> T. Roosevelt viewed institutions that were too big to fail as *trusts*, and as such, he considered them threats to national security. In the early 20th century, if a trust failed, it received little to no assistance from the government. To limit the damage to government and unemployment, trusts were broken up. The same applies today; a too big to fail financial institution is a threat to national security. The US government may not have the clout to break up an institution such as HSBC, but it can place limits on the amount of business it does with the corporation. If a company is broken up, the assets remain the same, and there could be job loss, but there could also be less corruption if corporations were made to understand that it would face harsh punishment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Israeli government treats Palestinian people as non-entities, with the hope that they will eventually "self-deport" to another area of the world. It is a condition with which Jews are well acclimated, the diaspora being just one example. But my support for the Palestinian people should not in any way be considered agreement with either country's use of violence. I recognize the actions of a bully when I see it, the constant overreaction to slights that escalates to violence. I also empathize with a people who were pushed aside, to make room for a nation that had not existed for close to 2000 years. It's as if a bunch of people calling themselves Roman decided today that all the people in Italy that didn't identify with being Roman were no longer recognized, and the country was defunct. But human beings believe we can lay claim to a place, when the reality is that when the earth's been injured enough by humanity, it will respond by eliminating the irritant. They believe there is some entity named yaweh, god, allah, buddah...waiting to accept them into a paradise, and will destroy anyone who doesn't believe as they do. If ever there were a one-word definition of mass murder it would be "religion." If humans stopped masking their pain by turning to religion, and instead placed ideology aside and asked how they could help one another, we would still fight but it would be with more honesty. Instead of standing beside Israel because "it's the only democracy in the middle east," the US could simply admit that the country's only use was as a conduit into a much-needed energy supply. By the way, name calling is the last bastion of a weak argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Changing climate conditions have led to droughts and a rise in food prices. The economic conditions have exasperated the decline, leading individuals to question leadership and the economic models that favor the elite. This is particularly true across the middle east where graft is an accepted practice in business. As U.S. power continues its decline both overseas and at home, the amount of aid to countries will substantially decrease, except to those countries that hold resources the federal government considers vital to national security. In the U.S., the economic downturn has halted and reversed any momentum to grow the middle class. Most Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck, working longer hours, and mired in school-loan debt. The new jobs being added to the economy are in the low-paying service industry. The discontent over wall street will continue to grow as more americans feel the tightening grip of the declining economy. Increasing violence, I believe, is just around the corner in the u.s. </TEXT>

If the FWP interviewer was black, the participant was more apt to be honest. If the interviewer was white, the information skewed to conform with the interviewer's beliefs of slave culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took an undergraduate native american history class from Prof. James Drake, and he discussed the inherent racism still practiced in the united states against indigenous americans, particularly by sports teams. Atlanta Braves, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, Florida State Seminoles, and a plethora of other teams abuse the indigenous american culture, while ignoring the pleas to correct their abuses. One washington d.c. newspaper decided to stop using the home team's name because of its unfair racial implications. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with Krugman about being suspicious about bipartisan social program reductions to what are referred to as "entitlements," but the term should broaden to include subsidies to industry, transportation and energy sectors. Labeling government funds for these industries as subsidies wrongly places the funds outside the narrative of deficit reduction, particularly when energy companies are enjoying record-breaking profits on a yearly basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After another viewing with special attention given to the archetypes and the director's explanation I've come to the conclusion that it ultimately didn't matter. From the minute the second lever was pulled, offering a blood sacrifice for a death that hadn't occurred, the final outcome had been determined. The director's explanation that in the rite the whore dies first, and the virgin last, but the order of the rest is left ambiguous. But it's a rite, and that means any step missed or taken out of order nullifies it. The big giveaway is when he pulls the second lever and both worlds experience an earthquake.

But leaving that aside, she fit the role of fool better than he fit it. In fact, of all the characters he was the least fooled of the group, and constantly called into question everything that was odd. His friends' odd personality changes, trying to stop the diary reading (drawing a line at the latin), finding the elevator - he recognized all these things. He could even be considered the virgin because of his uncomfortable reaction to the "whore" when she climbed on top of him. </TEXT>

Just prior to all hell breaking loose, the controllers are popping champagne, while the girl, which they assume is the virgin, takes a horrible beating. The stoner is both the virgin and the hero, protected from manipulation by his weed. Sigourney Weaver tries to talk the girl into shooting the stoner, still believing the girl is the virgin, whose death the controllers are ambivilent about. The stoner as virgin was a smart twist to the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's begin with Meredith Vickers' role in the film, which is foil to David, the son her father never had, but remains imperfect because he doesn't possess a soul. She doesn't believe in the mission, but it offers her an opportunity to gain her father's respect, while also providing the means to out perform him. She, like her father, is obsessed with surviving, evidenced by the surgery machine, and her own living pod, which can operate independently of the ship. When the ship is threatened by possibly infected returning crewmen, she is willing to turn a flamethrower on them. As the ship begins its final push to intercept the "Engineer's" ship, she opts for an escape pod, knowing it only buys her a few more hours of life. When she discovers her father made the trip, she's lost her authority and any chance to out perform him, and all that's left is out living him. In the end, she had to die, crushed by the embodiment of her own disbelief. She dies soulless, like both David and her father. Of the three characters, David is the only one who really believed in the mission. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good call on Roosevelt - he hated being called Teddy - because he was truly a giant in the fitness arena. He judged American manhood on its fitness, and overcame severe asthma to build a fit body. He was a good, if not great boxer, and rode horses for days at a time on cattle drives. He once threatened to "kick the balls" of a political colleague in the NY Senate, and knocked out a cowboy who called him four-eyes. He single-handedly captured and returned a cattle thief to the local sheriff, and during the 1912 election campaign suffered a gunshot wound by an assassin but still spoke for 1.5 hours before going to hospital. He also spent time hunting in Africa, and is the only American president to have ventured into the Amazon rain forest; he almost died on the expedition, and the jungle's effects remained with him for the rest of his short life. He was also our most mentally fit president who devoured books at an amazing rate. He is our most literate president, having written 21(?) books, and won the Nobel Peace Prize while in office for brokering peace between Japan and Russia. It's sad that the Republican Party doesn't recognize him, eschewing him as an independent instead, because he was truly a president who cared about the people. </TEXT>

The NAR issued guidelines designed to exclude African-american families from a community; also known as covenants, these rules included binding contracts signed by homeowners that declared the family would not sell their property to AAs. "White flight," assisted by the automobile, led to white middle- and working-class families moving farther from urban centers, and the development of suburbia. The rumors mentioned by the interviewees were fomented by the NAR because its members wanted to retain a monopoly position in setting housing prices. If class mixing became the norm, NAR representatives (realtors) could no longer charge customers inflated prices to maintain a white community. </TEXT>

David Stockman, the granddaddy of this movement, publicly admitted it was "voodoo economics" during a magazine interview, and stated it was the only way to sell the idea to the public. Dutch Reagan's greatest ability was as a shill, whether working for GE or the GOP, selling the idea of tax cuts for the wealthy to the blue-collar electorate. Sadly, this policy allowed industrialists and bankers to keep a majority of their profits, while moving their operations overseas to a cheaper labor market. Labor unions, the only real engine of change for the average working American, have been effectively rendered impotent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I always find disconcerting about analysis of biblical text is the disregard we have for the evolutionary process of christianity from a jewish sect to mainstream religion. Any argument regarding jesus's marital status is immediately suspect and subject to derision. A contemporary self-identifying christian would hardly recognize a 1st century christian, and they certainly wouldn't possess the necessary courage to die for it as did early christians. That christianity adopted much of the essenes's beliefs, especially baptism, is readily accepted by many roman history scholars, but remains a point of contention with religious fundamentalists.

The downvotes remind me that religion has no use for objective/subjective historical studies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took an undergrad Roman history class with a professor who told students on the first day of class that if they were christians, his lectures would offend them, and encouraged them to have an open mind. Invariably, he said, at least one student would complain to the dean and demand he change his lectures. In his lectures, he stated that jesus and mary magdalene were married, and offered as proof the biblical accounts of the Roman execution and the handling of jesus's body. Romans, he said, were very strict in the handling of dissident's bodies, and would only allow immediate family members or the wife to view the body. Roman leadership constantly monitored local attitudes to keep the masses in check, and restricting access to the dissident's body was one of those measures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you, sir, for giving a very good example of the Republican voter; I, however, am an independent voter and offer analysis of the parties' messages to the nation. My generalization of Dems as inclusive is based in part on the conventions participants. Undeniably, the Republican convention participants presented a majority "white" conservative demographic, and on one occasion acted less than inclusive by shouting down a Republican Puerto Rico speaker. The Dems convention participants, on the other hand, offered a clear example of the "melting pot" mentality so proudly offered on the symbol of American freedom - the Statue of Liberty.

As for blaming Republicans on the credit downgrade, I'm going to repeat what I wrote earlier - Americans are not stupid. They also won't forget the Tea and Republican parties' roles in killing jobs bills that could offer American's employment. </TEXT>

At this point I've got a good feel for what Obama believes and I don't agree with a number of his policies; my greatest complaint with Romney is his cardboard-cutout political identity.

During studies for my journalism degree, professors consistently insisted on objectivity in my writing, and that I backup my reporting with facts. Taibbi's writing is not objective, but it is substantive as he provides verifiable evidence. If forced to compare Taibbi to another historical figure, Will Rogers or Mark Twain jump to mind because they voiced opinions that spoke to their listeners/readers. Much like Rogers or Twain, Taibbi understands and voices the outrage experienced by the average American in relation to the contemporary political and economic situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I share your frustration with the sorry state of America's social system, and it's my major complaint with the Pro-life bunch in that any empathy for a child dissipates when it exits the womb. After that, it's the mother/father's responsibility to care for the child, regardless of the economic/social environment. Poverty is no longer confined to the urban landscape, as suburban cities are now experiencing the economic contractions and high unemployment. IMO the conservatives that agitate so strenuously for anti-abortion are also the ones that would cut social services because it encourages people not to work. I don't know one person who wants to be poor just to collect government assistance or health care. The poorest members of our society don't have the ready access to birth control, and may not even recognize they're pregnant. Having a child drastically changes the future economic options for parents, and if they're already in bad financial shape, the child will pay for it. I guess I'm angry that conservatives concern for children appears to stop at the womb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the contemporary U.S. is, by your definition, a fascist state? Corporate entities now represent America's interests, and the Supreme Court granted them personhood. In your representation of unions, you state the NRA "grouped workers into unions," however, in reality, unionization was a grassroots movement. It really began with the Wobblies in the late 1900s, but without government support, the movement went into hibernation. To aver that the government grouped workers into unions doesn't jibe with the research I've done the movement.

edit: I also meant to address your statement was not the same as the NRA, but it was an extension of the program. Now, the Supreme Court decided that portions of the NRA were indeed constitutional, in which case they were extended under a new program name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My understanding of the Wagner Act is that it allowed the National Labor Relations Board to monitor union elections and assure no foul play. Prior to the Wagner Act, "workers could be beaten by supervisors and fired at will, and management determined the length of the workday and speed of the assembly line. (Give Me Liberty - Eric Foner p.813) As for the Works Progress Administration, it built 500k miles of roads, 600 airports, stadiums, sewage treatment plants, while also developing histories and guidebooks for all 48 states. The arts portion also painted murals in buildings, and compiled an oral history of the remaining slaves still alive.(Ibid, p818)

Now, that's my understanding of the Wagner Act and NRA. Before this conversation progresses any further, would you please give me your understanding of Fascism? And, perhaps the source from which you quoted, just so I can understand the context of FDR's words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe the issue depends on who's doing the judging. For example, Theodore Roosevelt was extremely popular with the people, but the Republican party and industry considered his policies a disaster. When he declared large portions of land under federal jurisdiction in order to form the many national parks we now enjoy, Republicans and industry (railroads, lumber supply, mining) were enraged. By attacking the trusts, TR basically knee-capped the Republican fundraising machine. While historians still recognize the value of TR's policies in relation to the nation at large, Republicans still ignore him, or label him a Progressive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An attempt to explain Chicago's success and Detroit's decline is simply too restricted by the forum on reddit. I've listed three books below that explain in chilling detail the different routes both cities followed, and why Detroit languished. Vampire offers a general explanation but the books below delve into the social, class, and race aspects of the two cities. You may want to read Arc of Justice first because it is an easy and entertaining book about an African American man's dream to own a home, and white society's effort to crush that dream. Thomas Sugrue's book is for an academic audience, but it explains the socioeconomic blueprint for Detroit's urban decline. Sadly, this blueprint also explains the decline in what is now popularly known as the rustbelt. Finally, Cohen's book explains why Chicago grasped onto the New Deal programs which allowed the city to flourish.

<TEXT> I've viewed some good answers below, however if we constrain the answer to "Cold War" and "communism", I can offer another opinion.
First, I'm defining communism as antithetical to capitalism, and a one party state governed by a single individual. Second, the Cold War is defined as the reaction to this struggle.

According to J.L. Gaddis, the roots of the cold war stretch to the brief American military intervention during the October Revolution. The distrust Stalin had for the US began during this period. Americans were seen as interlopers that embraced a capitalistic predation in order to control the masses. This is the view presented by George Kennan's Long Telegram and the beginning of US containment policy.

There is another much deeper element to this story however - the conflation of socialism with communism. In America's labor history, socialists play a very important role; they were great organizers and understood how to speak to the masses in relation to economic inequality and unfair working conditions. Socialists also created some very gifted writers. Often they recruited within the movie industry, a maven for creative writers. The socialist's impact on labor did not go unnoticed by the feds or Wall street. This conflation between socialism and communism was an ongoing process that accelerated during and after WWII. 

The cold war really caught fire with the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1947. Former Hollywood notables (Ron Reagan) claimed the movie industry was rife with communists, resulting in HUAC and the Hollywood Blacklist.

On the government side, Joe McCarthy began a witch-hunt in the State Department. The American public had good reason to believe there were communist spies everywhere. During this period the feds uncovered the Silvermaster Group and the Rosenburgs, while the Brits nabbed Alger Hiss. McCarthy's hunt finally ended when he took on the Army; the backlash ended his political career, and alcohol took his life.

There you have it...I don't feel like typing anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you decide to pursue a graduate degree in history, the seminar on historical methods is usually required in the first semester/quarter. Hayden White, Karl Marx, Leopold van Ranke, Jacob Burckhardt, and Immanuel Kant are usually included because they represent different styles of historical research. White's thesis in *Metahistory* is that when a historian writes about an event, they use a historical method of writing such as Marxist, post-modern, revisionist, Annales, big history, and so on. Contemporary historians can identify the writer's method by studying the linguistic properties utilized. What Mr_Quacky alluded to "when historians write 'History' with a capital H" is that the winners in a conflict will write the history of that conflict in a manner with which the reader identifies. By studying the historian's use of language, the reader is able to identify the objective vs. subjective argument that is the framework of the underlying narrative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's correct on a lot of levels, but especially in relation to branding the "other." Racial politics and branding span the entirety of U.S. politics; Jefferson was smeared by his opponents for his affair with a slave. More importantly, most Americans are so limited in their knowledge of U.S. history that they believe race was defined in the white and black dichotomy. In *Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class*, David Roediger writes about the different layers of whiteness, with Irish and East European personages falling under the umbrella of the "negro." Home ownership became the main vehicle for this group to earn their "white" designation. Owning a home implied a person was trustworthy, hardworking, and stable.  </TEXT>

This is simply untrue. TR changed the Civil Service process to include an exam to qualify that the applicant was indeed fit for the job. Before TR's changes, civil service positions were used by politicians as a means of reward for their friends. He changed civil service by replacing a system where jobs were sold to the highest bidder with a merit system based on examination. His trust busting campaigns also earned him scorn from contemporary wealthy scions and his own Republican Party. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The major reason the South voted Democrat centers around the wide-spread use of voter suppression methods to restrict black voting. The Republican's waving of the "bloody shirt" and its moniker, the Party of Lincoln, resounded among black voters but the Southern Democrats used legal/extralegal intimidation to keep African-American voters at home on election day. Voter suppression remained a problem well into the 1960s, culminating in the "Freedom Riders" who actively worked to register Southern AA. Sadly, some of those who participated lost their lives to the cause.

Lyndon Johnson's welfare legislation was intended to help AA transition from a position of poverty with the Great Society programs. Johnson said, "You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, `You are free to compete with an the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair."

When Nixon arrived in office he began dismantling Great Society programs, a trend that has continued with every Republican president. Because AA are especially sensitive to the need for a strong social safety net, they tend to vote Democrat now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christian's argument is that the ability to increase productivity enough to sustain a large population was absolutely necessary to the formation of a civilization. An example of this can be found in the multitude of indigenous tribes that formed in early North America. Lacking access to draft animals for the plowing of land, indigenous Americans could only produce enough sustainable foodstuffs for a very small population. As a result, the impetus to join together into larger communities was almost nonexistent. The only North American example I can think of is the Anasazi (Chaco Canyon) and it fell long before the Spanish arrived.  </TEXT>

There's a good reason the U.S. required retrieved photos vs using bandwidth; the Soviets utilized frequency bursts to transmit their data. If the U.S. monitored the Soviet missile launch sites, the type of booster vehicle used by their space agency gave U.S. monitors a clue to the type of Soviet satellite being launched. The booster information also gave a clue to the satellite's orbit and with this information it was possible to intercept their satellite's transmissions. By using a capture/retrieval method, the U.S. assured this project remain relatively secret. </TEXT>

With its supply lines cut by Pakistan, the U.S. pulls out all troops by July 2013. Seeing a power vacuum in the region, Pakistan exploits its ties to the Taliban, creating a puppet state. China and Russia extend support to Pakistan in an effort to offset the U.S.'s presence in Asia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe protesters should just carry the American flag, they should wrap themselves in the flag as if it's a shawl. As a photojournalist, the imagery of kneeling protesters wrapped in the American flag and being beaten or pepper sprayed would be a dream photograph. It's a win-win situation because the cops will look horrible defaming such a powerful American symbol. It'd be priceless to see how Fox news would spin any violence directed toward the protesters, and Jon Stewart's Daily Show would eat it up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see the OWS as a blend of the Populist and Progressive movements. Progressives, such as Jacob Riis,Upton Sinclair, and Teddy Roosevelt, saw the economic effects of business trusts on poor and working-class urban/rural Americans and were appalled. The Populist movement was hampered by what the average American considered the socialist and anarchist threats. These fears of a eastern European horde immigrating into the U.S. resulted in the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act that restricted southern and eastern European immigration. This movement also had strong nationalistic tendencies, which I see as a direct correlation to the contemporary Tea Party movement. </TEXT>

As for pretending I know what's going on in relation to American history, I fooled two universities into giving me degrees that say just that. Let's see how much you know about this period. I'll ask a simple question that any of my students can answer: What do historians call the period that stretches from 1890-1920s? Extra points if you can name two activists during this time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Your use of a 1904 poster shows the problem with your analysis. Social darwinism, by definition, requires that there be competition on equal grounds amongst people. In 1904, after slavery had been abolished, there was competition."

Darwinism does require competition, however it's not on equal grounds. White slave owners considered their slaves as inferior, and no better than animals. I'm also not going to argue this point any further in that you don't understand your own nation's history. As for Ron Paul, I could care less about the man or his politics. He is a libertarian, a group that was popular during the early 1900s, and its influence paved the way for the later economic melt down that began in the 1920s, leading to the Great Depression. Libertarians are simply political Luddites. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He may or may not be a social darwinist in re race. I honestly don't know and certainly don't know what you think social darwinism has to do with slavery.

Social Darwinism played a huge part in slavery, and continued to be used as an excuse by American politicians in both the north and the south to enforce Jim Crow laws and the "separate-but-equal-philosophy." For example, [here](http://i.imgur.com/38K02.jpg) is a poster from the 1904 St. Louis Expo that lists the Races of Man according to the Social Darwin scale. Many historians argue that the U.S. Government's [reason](http://i.imgur.com/2PPyj.jpg) for occupying the Philippines and Cuba was to protect its backward citizens from cruel Spain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to suggest one book for you, but it is a very long book. "Maps of Time: an introduction to big history" by David Christian is a book that documents the history of earth from its inception to the 2000s. I recommend this book because it discusses patterns and cycles that are hidden unless the individual views the big picture. It is a peer-reviewed book by a noted and well-respected historian that places mankind in context to the planet. We humans seem to believe that manipulating our environment comes with no consequences. Much like Carl Sagan described the Earth in relation to the cosmos, Christian performs the same service for our planet and species. As any planetary scientist could tell you, we are a small speck on an inconsequential planet that sits on a back-water portion of a spiral in the Milky Way. We are nothing in cosmic terms and if humans were to disappear do you believe the cosmos would notice?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm no Luddite and love technology as much as the next person, however, I'm also a realist. In geological terms, Homo sapiens have only spent an eye blink on this planet. During this short period we are responsible for an extinction level event that is on par with the loss of the dinosaurs. You won't have to decide on who lives/dies during the great die off, nature will do that. I hear people say, "We must save the planet, we're killing it." This planet will be just fine; it will bounce back and continue to spin. It's the people that really have to worry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I won't stop it. That is the problem with the U.S.; too many people are willing to lay down and let shit happen to them. We are in the middle of a culture war with the nation's wealthy who base their opinions on appearance. The right car, college, diction, and associations all play into this paradigm. The reason no one is getting hired today is because there are no jobs. The wealthy have gutted the labor unions leaving very few institutions powerful enough to represent the poor. The latest budget fight is a glaring example of the lengths politicians are willing to go to protect the wealthy. Instead of stopping, you should be getting angry. </TEXT>

I could say misery enjoys company but that's not why I want the stocks to drop. In my opinion, the political and economic system in the U.S. needs fixing and the only way that will happen is if enough middle-class people REALLY feel the financial pain a large proportion of Americans already experience. I welcome these numbers because they're another step in that direction. </TEXT>

Michel Foucault spoke about the close association between prisons and the school system in his book ["Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish) He argued that children are taught from a very young age to line up, sit, answer bells, and be watched over by an authority figure.

<TEXT> How have I not heard of this man? Thoreau would be proud. DeChristopher is just the first actor in what will soon be a flood of civil disobedience. 

"And after 150 years of making other people rich, West Virginia is almost dead last among the states in per capita income, education rates and life expectancy.  And its not an anomaly.  The areas with the richest fossil fuel resources, whether coal in West Virginia and Kentucky, or oil in Louisiana and Mississippi, are the areas with the lowest standards of living.  In part, this is a necessity of the industry.  The only way to convince someone to blow up their backyard or poison their water is to make sure they are so desperate that they have no other option."

This statement is dead on, but the poor are close to their tipping point. When that point comes, no amount of government protection will stand in the way of civil disobedience. </TEXT>

You should probably qualify this statement by saying "in the west today." In the undeveloped western world, having a large number of babies was the norm. With a plethora of resources, many of the children survived but child mortality remained a big problem. Famine in Africa is not new.

There is such competition among the different branches that they will continue to support a defense contractor's project even if it's a failure and a waste of taxpayer money. Hartung also credits Lockheed with developing the political strategy of "too big to fail." When congress threatened to pull MIC funding during the 70s because of the C-5A scandal, Lockheed said it would fail without a Bailout.

And representativeness can take a whole host of forms - race, education, social status, income, region and so on. "When you look at all of those, you find that the force is really quite representative of the country," he said in a recent interview. "It mirrors the country in many of these. And where it doesn't mirror America, it exceeds America."

It mirrors the country, which is majority working class. The article alludes to education but that has no relation to class. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm with you on this one. I've said for years that the Legislative branch should only be allowed two terms, which is the same limit for the president. We now have congress people whose only goals are reelection, making money, and stepping into the revolving door of private industry. Remove the monetary incentive from the legislative process and the U.S. just might discover new leaders who want to improve their country instead of raping it.

<TEXT> Blue Beard - "The Great Depression was going on, so that the station and the streets teemed with homeless people, just as they do today. The newspapers were full of stories of worker layoffs and farm foreclosures and bank failures, just as they are today. All that has changed, in my opinion, is that, thanks to television, we can hide a Great Depression. We may even be hiding a Third World War." (p. 71-72)

"He suggested that we build a Money Hall of Fame out there, with busts of the arbitrageurs and hostile-takeover specialists and venture capitalists and investment bankers and golden handshakers and platinum parachutists in niches, with their statistics cut into stone -- how many millions they had stolen legally in how short a time."

But my reality is that I will go to sleep tonight in my small room, and to the room on my right is an alcoholic, and to my left is a heroin addict, both fighting their own inner demons. I'm sure if someone sat down to talk with them that their lives would appear unbelievable as well. As for myself, I'm not some mysterious soldier; anyone possessing a TS/SCI clearance and signed that little paper given at the beginning and end of any debriefing can attest to the fact that there are mandatory monetary and penal consequences for anyone who reveals state secrets. I also didn't say there are no friends or family I can rely on; I did say that most of them are walking that thin line that I've fallen below. This is my current reality and I will recover from it, but the barriers in my path are very real whether or not they fit into your narrative. </TEXT>

I believe both education and experience are equally important; those that can find a balance between the two are the most successful, imo. If I had to do it all over again, I would still have attempted the masters. Knowledge is a resource that, once earned, can't be taken away. As for advice:
1. try to stay close to home or family
2. find a way to maintain a means of communication
3. don't believe the state or federal social system will be there for you, it won't. the social systems that will help help you are most often found at the community level.
4. don't become too personally attached to anything of value; recognize its future value as a means to make it another day.
5. don't be afraid to ask for help; swallow your pride because there are people who take real pleasure in helping others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The items most needed by the homeless are for hygiene and a means to utilize public transportation. This is the United States, and as I've repeatedly told my family, I'll never starve. Assistance with food is readily available, but hygiene products are not covered by government assistance. Shampoo, razors, soap, deodorant, and clothing are in high demand, but often unattainable. Transportation is another big issue for the homeless. Often, the means to reach a job interview aren't available because they don't have the money for public transportation. I considered myself lucky to have my car, however, I went for a job interview in downtown Seattle. I parked on the street and used what little change I had to pay the meter. Unaware that the street became a through-way for buses after a certain time, my car was ticketed, towed, and impounded. Those individuals living in Seattle will agree that the signs posted in these areas don't clearly warn the uniformed about these parking traps. When I parked, it was with a long line of cars and I paid the fare. I returned to discover my car was gone and thought it'd been stolen. After asking a student, she was unsurprised to tell me it was probably towed. With great sadness, I sold one of my two laptops to get my car back. Without the money for gas, I'm now reliant on the Seattle public transportation system, and the kindness of this shelter which has provided me with a ORCA card. It has fifty dollars on it to be used on public transportation, of which Seattle's is very good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a religious person, so the holidays are not that important. I do volunteer work, so that's how I'm spending the holidays. Yesterday I did an event for the animal shelter by photographing people with their pets at a PetSmart. My family does know about my situation, but we come from the working class and they're all just barely making it. There are many individuals in my situation, and the numbers will continue to grow. If you saw the photos from my flikr page, there was an entire line of cars filled with people in my situation. That was only one side of the parking lot; there was another entire section filled with people living out of their cars. I studied as an historian, and understand the problems of homelessness. In fact, understanding the system that placed me in this situation makes it that much more frustrating. After moving into this shelter, I was asked by the director to represent the clients in an interview with the E network. I had mixed feelings about this, because I was a college instructor for a short period, and the thought of my students seeing how far I'd fallen was shameful. However, the benefit of helping not only other veterans, but the homeless as well, overrode my prideful side. My situation is what it is, but it doesn't define who I am, and it has humbled me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A large part of my day was spent trying to find food, a place to shower, and avoiding the police. Authorities seem to have a second sense when it comes to homeless people, who they consider a bad image for the city. Libraries are a great resource, but many of them have rules in place to discourage use by the homeless. I'm someone who is attentive to hygiene, so having to go days without bathing absolutely annoyed me. To save money on razors, I grew a beard, which I keep neatly trimmed. Maintaining clean clothing is another big challenge. Laundromats are expensive and there aren't many resources for the homeless in this area. I want to share a photo of my shelter, but for the privacy of other residents, I'm simply not allowed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I felt my education and work background insulated me from ever becoming homeless. I was wrong. As a member of the working class in the U.S., my drop into the truly indigent was short and painful. I didn't mean the description to sound creepy, but if a redditor is in the working class, my situation can serve as an abject example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a 45-year-old male who found himself homeless because of the current financial downturn. In 2006 I completed two bachelors, one in journalism, the other in history. Over the next four years I worked toward a masters in history. With the economy worsening, I realized the opportunity to finish my masters was limited. No one in my family has gone beyond a bachelors so my efforts were considered a matter of pride for my dad. In order to pass the summer exams, I quit my job to study. I paid for school and living expenses using a small retirement 401K and a savings account of about $2000. I believed that earning a masters would provide more job opportunities, so the gamble was worth it, imo. As I studied over the summer, I flooded the job market with resumes. After taking and passing my exams on August 21, I received a job offer in public relations from a large company in Seattle. I jumped at the opportunity, and having exhausted all my financial resources, sold all my household goods on craigslist. After arriving in Seattle, I received an email from the HR head of this large firm stating the PR position was an entry level job and I was over qualified for it. He went on to state that someone with my education background and work experience was unlikely to remain with their corporation at the entry level position. The offer was rescinded and I found myself without a job, home, or funds outside of Tacoma, Washington. I'd held back a few items to sell if I reached a desperate state, such as needing gas or food. The first item to go was my favorite dress watch, pawned for food and gas money. My vacuum cleaner went next, and then several wall clocks. These were all small items that fit in the trunk of my car. I had two laptops, but didn't want to part with either because I consider them indispensable for finding work. I attempted to enter a homeless shelter in Tacoma, but after two failed robberies by individuals trying to break into my car, I decided to find a rest stop to park and live. [This](http://www.flickr.com/photos/55230349@N04/) is where I lived for the next two months. As the days grew colder, I turned to Veterans Affairs for help. First, I went to the VA hospital in American Lake just south of Tacoma. Because I didn't suffer from an alcohol or drug addiction, my options were limited. I continued searching for jobs, but because I'd never been homeless or lived on food stamps, I didn't know where or how to apply for these services. Because I'd quit my job, unemployment benefits were not available. When asked by Washington State officials if I was unable to work because of a disability, I had to answer in the negative. This meant I wasn't eligible for monetary assistance but I was given food stamps. I continually contacted the VA social worker at American Lake to ask for help, but there just wasn't much assistance for someone in my position. I was eventually referred to a VA social worker in Seattle, and within days he placed me in the veterans shelter where I'm now living. I'm still angry and confused about a system that I've paid into for my entire adult life only to find it of no use when I needed it the most. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I served from Oct 1983 to Oct 1991; I can't tell you the particulars of my enlistment because it's considered classified and the consequences would mean many, many years in a federal prison. There's also a financial penalty, but it doesn't mean much to someone who has nothing to take. I'll post the circumstances of my situation in a reply to redFoxRun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a nice shelter, but more importantly, it is safe. Most homeless shelters are populated by individuals with drinking or drug abuse problems; individuals in such a shelter are prone to rapid mood changes and they're always on the hunt for the means to carry on their addictions. They make no distinctions between wealthy or poor; if you have anything worth selling, they will attempt to take it. I need to stress, however, that individuals such as these are in the grip of a disease they can control but don't know how. They aren't really bad people. They're simply desperate. </TEXT>
