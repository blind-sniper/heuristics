<TITLE> Near Future Story Idea </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-13 19:27:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A group of 3 friends hear of a sponsored tournament for a popular virtual reality game in the near future (as in they are actually in the game, not like an Oculus Rift kind of VR), they play this game rather often, and consider themselves quite good at it. They decide to enter for a chance to play in the tournament, along with hundreds of other people. They need to win a certain number of preliminary games in order to be placed in the tournament against 4 other teams of 3,  15 people in all. They quickly win many preliminary games and find themselves in the roster for the final game of the tournimant. 

The objective of the game is to find an object in the world, game settings are gigantic and could be in a city/forest/etc, and place said object inside the goal which is at the very center of the map - by any means possible. The winners money starts at $100,000 from the sponsors, but throughout the tournament viewers donate money to the pool to increase tension amongst viewers and players. Players are allowed to do anything within their power to kill or trap players in other teams to give themselves an edge. The game lasts many days, depending on how fast players find the object and deliver it to the goal.

If you die, you are placed in a lobby where you can leave or stay and watch the rest of the game. I dont know if it should be where if you die you get no money if your team wins, or if you SHOULD get money for your team winning once dead, i dont know. 

I dont want it to be just another hunger games esc book so any feedback is greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> New Nuke Release Date Prediction </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-09 00:32:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Valve released the first Train teaser on June 1st, 2014; They then released the full map on December 10th, 2014. 6 months later.

Possibly using this time frame we can predict when the new Nuke will be released.

Valve released the first Nuke teaser on March 31, 2015. 

I presume we will get the new Nuke sometime in September.

Or they could be completely unrelated and have nothing to do with each other, that could be a possibility.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> what about the first part, where the map is only loaded once, and the server you are on is what determines doors/loot/cars/helis/time of day/etc </TEXT>
</WRITING>
<WRITING>
<TITLE> Idea for server and map loading. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-07 19:53:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I recently had an idea for a new way for servers to load the map, I have no idea if this would actually work, seeing as how i have no idea how servers or games work.

So my idea was that the Chernarus map is only loaded once, either by 1 server or something else. This way, the only thing somebodies server has to load is dynamic things, such as doors being opened/close, loot, heli crashes, cars, etc. 

There could also be a thing similar to seeding a torrent, where if somebody else is rendering the same place as you are, your computer doesnt have to work as hard because of the other person. So say you are at NWAF and somebody on a completely different server is also at NWAF. Because both people are rendering NWAF, they both have 1/2 the load of the render until one of them leaves. If there are, say, 200 people all in different servers, they would each only have to render a fraction of NWAF.

I have no clue how that second part would work, and it probably wouldn't, but its just an idea I had.

Sorry if this made no sense, I was just rambling ideas out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have brown-level hunger and after searching through 3 rather large cities/towns and not finding any food, i decided to search for apples. 15 minutes later and 20 apples eaten my hunger has not gone down at all. They either need to make apples better or raise the chance of finding apples. (its also weird that you can see apples on the trees yet somehow dont find any)

If you are going to have nature be the only way to find food, make it common.

After running around the countryside for a few hours i had only spotted 1 animal, a moose. however, as soon as i saw it (about 200m away) it bolted away from me making it impossible to hunt. </TEXT>

2. Purple Guy #1 (http://i.imgur.com/6FU0a95.png) kills The Puppet Child on the street and the 5 children using Golden Freddy at Fredbear's Diner, and later is caught and arrested.
(maybe the calls in FNaF2 are pre-recorded)

3. Purple Guy #2 / Night Guard ((http://i.imgur.com/G5vDChg.png) maybe before Jeremy?) does something unknown? to make the spirits hate him.

4. The Puppet controls the Toy Animatronics to kill the night guard in FNaF2.

5. Toy animatronics are scrapped and possessed animatronics are repaired for FNaF1 (presumably The Puppet is also scrapped).

6. The events of FNaF1 take place.

7. After FNaF1 the possessed animatronics are destroyed by Purple Guy #2 and the spirits sp00k him into Springtrap, killing him.

(afterthoughts) If the calls form FNaF2 AREN'T pre-recorded, and the 5 children are killed DURING FNaF2, why are the old animatronics from Fredbear's being possessed?

<DATE> 2014-12-31 04:25:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So i have added some new ideas to my map (it is still just a drawing that i have moved from paint into paint.net to allow me to have more freedom to do assorted things) First, some 'story' about parts of the map. the northern most city, "North City" has a tall wall going around the surrounding area. Players will need special clothes in order to survive the radiation of north city for more than a minute. North City will have lots of military loot and will (hopefully) be a hotspot for players to go to to get good gear. This idea isn't even 10% done, so any feedback would be highly appreciated.
