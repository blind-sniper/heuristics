<TITLE> What are some movies about medieval Germany? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-22 07:13:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like almost every big budget medieval movie is either set in England, France, or some fantasy realm (where everyone inexplicably has an english accent). Maybe this is just due to exposure because i'm from an english speaking country but I don't know of any movies set in medieval Germany, Austria, Poland, etc yet i'm quite interested in the Holy Roman Empire and this place/period (1000-1600 C.E.) in general. Do you guys have any suggestions? I don't care about language, just production quality (good costumes and sets) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny story actually. I randomly clicked Berserk:Golden Age I on Netflix in midst the peak of my Dark Souls obsession and naturally got into it because of the similarities. I was with my gf and she made fun of me and said I could only see the similarities because of how obsessed I was with Dark Souls at the time (she had to persuade me to put the game down just to come over that night.) Now of course I know there are some concrete influences and she can suck it.

<TEXT> So I decided to cap this character just before 2m soul memory to perpetually help with Velstadt because he's my favourite boss. I'm at around 1,980,000 SM with just enough souls to buy the agape ring (first mistake) and for some reason I stupidly decided to leave Staids bonfire unlit this playthrough (second mistake) so i'm making my way over from the one in Sinners Rise. I get invaded by some guy, and not wanting to go over 2M, I plan to let him win. Only as soon as I gesture, he just runs straight off the cliff. Like he knew. 

Anyway, [this](http://i.imgur.com/CQ8AY5t.jpg) is what I was left with after the smoke cleared. _

TLDR: Ill-timed suicidal invader messed up my whole playthrough plan just by diving off a ledge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't Dark Souls 3 speculation, just wishful thinking. Apologies if this sort of question has been asked before.

Personally i've noticed one thing missing from any previous Souls games are flails. I love me some swordplay but every once in a while I just wanna go swinging around a big spiky ball like a cartoon knight. I get that it's probably physics related, hard to make a realistic flail animation but it would be awesome to have one day.

Another weapon i'd love to see is essentially a blunt spike the size of a dagger. I don't know the technical name of it, the documentary I saw it in just called it a bollock dagger because of the hilt shape, which I know can also have a cutting edge, but anyway... yeah, it'd be a great alternative to the parry dagger since they're specifically designed for punching through plate armour in hand to hand combat. I imagine it could also have a parrying option, but just scale really well against certain enemy/armour types.

I'd like to see an Ulfberht (I know this is essentially just a broadsword, but it would have a cool ass description or something)

And finally.. I'd like to see some hookswords. I know they're a little impractical but then we could finally cosplay Kabal </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, I'm casually playing through ALBW right now and to be honest all it does it make me want to play the old GBC games. Seasons was always my favourite of the two. 

I can't say anything bad about ALBW (Although going in blind I thought it was going to be incredibly short until the Lorule world was revealed) but the Oracle games and even LA DX definitely have the nostalgia factor for me, and that's the main reason why I play Zelda so they win. Plus the puzzles were definitely more difficult back in the day. I replayed the Oracle games last summer and still constantly found myself looking up walkthroughs for puzzles. ALBW hasn't given me as much trouble so far...

<TITLE> Is Suits set in the present? How old are the characters? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-09 10:12:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I always assumed it was set in the present, which would make Harvey 43 and Mike 34 according to the Suits Wiki. That doesn't seem right... I always placed Harvey in his mid to late 30's and Mike in his mid 20's.

However, the show has been on for 4 years (5 seasons) and obviously each season doesn't cover an entire year in their universe. According to the wiki, 2007 was the year that the Daniel Hardman embezzlement incident took place, and the current events take place 5 years after that, making it still 2012. This puts Harvey at 40, which seems reasonable I suppose (still imagined him younger, since he's portrayed as such a wunderkind), but Mike is still 31.

Am I missing something or does that seem too old? He never even made it to law school and undergrad/college prep is only like 4 years max, plus he got kicked out early. Are we supposed to believe he just kicked around as a bike messenger for 6~10 years before that one random encounter at a law office sparked his desire to "become something more than just a bike messenger" again? Sorry if this comes across as incoherent or my math is wrong, it's late lol.

*edit: just saw there's literally a question about their ages on the front page already lol. Still, I feel as though the ages seem off. Anybody agree?

<TEXT> Paying attention to key or "energy" isn't too important with techno, especially if you key-lock. I used to religiously mix by key via Traktors' built in key detection, and it can help you clean your mixes up to an extent if you're just starting out or do lots of melodic stuff, but honestly in the long run I found it just limits creativity. 

I now just organize my music by genre, mood and sound. For example, I keep banger peak-hour big room tracks together, the groovy, more techy stuff together, the deep hypnotic afterhours stuff together, etc etc. That way depending on the crowd and the gig, I can easily just throw together a mix of stuff I know will work well together, without having a playlist completely set in stone.

edit: I'm also in the habit of weeding out my main playlists of "filler" tracks so that I don't end up relying on them too much for transitions. If you know two tracks work great together, chances are you've already played them in a mix so I try to avoid getting stale by sending overused tracks to purgatory.

<TEXT> Soul Vessel if you really need to change things up, but just power through it until you've completed everything at least once. Shulva is definitely the easiest of the DLCs, and Sinh is a really fun fight once you get past all the shitty poison enemies and traps the level has to offer.

<TITLE> Some questions about PVP/Fightclub etiquette </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-06 21:47:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright I know this could have been posted in DarkSoulsPVP but this sub is a LOT more active so forgive me.

Basically I just want to know how fight clubs work. Is it just any dude who summons a bunch of blood/dragon pvpers on the bridge (or wherever the current popular spot is) or is there more to it?

I've inferred from my limited pvp experience and just browsing this sub that to wave and then bow when you're ready to duel is the polite way to initiate a friendly fight. Is this true or am I overthinking it?

I have summoned people on the bridge just to have them immediately return to their world so i'm a little bit confused as to what the etiquette is haha.

edit:typo

<TEXT> Wow I played this game like a year ago but I must have missed this. Nice find! While not a unique concept, I feel like this is still definitely an homage. The helmet even looks like the Heide Iron Mask from DaS2. 

Another platformer with a pretty obvious bonfire reference is [Shovel Knight.](http://ell.akamai.coub.com/get/bucket:12.21/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/31bddd53536/c717421fc6ab7d04de7c7/med_1405622170_image.jpg) It's not really an easter egg but the devs openly admit to loving Dark Souls so in my mind it's an homage.

<TEXT> Yeah you're right, one thing i've come to notice about the Souls games is that the best strategies for killing them are usually the lamest. Dodge around, wait for combo to end, attack or heal, repeat...

Dodging and getting down tight timings is fun, but I'd love to have a system that encourages head on fighting and more viable options for those who prefer aggressive tank play styles, instead of always just kite or be killed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol I just tried out the grand lance against Velstadt. I ended up ditching the shield early in and just two handing it but yeah I rekt him first try, definitely a good suggestion! And may I just say damn what a difference agility makes with dodging in that fight. My first playthrough I never put anything into ADP and fights like Velstadt and Fume were soo much harder!

<TITLE> Let's talk arms and armour (PvE optimization) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-17 23:12:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright so i'm well into my third play-through on my original character, and i'm just wondering if I could be optimizing my damage/protection a little bit more. 

I'm a str build knight with 40 faith for sunlight blade. I have been using a Drakeblood Greatsword+5 paired with the lightening clutch because the DBGS also has lightning damage already. I know certain weapons definitely do more scaling str damage outright (great club, mastodon GS, Zwei) but I find the agile moveset and low stamina-per-swing cost of the lighter (6.0) Drakeblood sword much easier for boss fights. 

Soo I'm sorta just wondering if there's an even better dps weapon for this sort of play style that I might have overlooked.

Also, for armour generally I do my own fashion souls thing but sometimes I need extra protection if a boss is just kicking my ass for some reason. Is there any better set in terms of weight to defence ratio than fully upgraded Drangleic? I've tried the Heide set, Drakeblood set, Elite Knight set, Loyce set... nothing seems quite as good.

<TEXT> I agree with the points you made on level design, but personally I appreciate the difficulty of the new bosses like the Fume Knight and the Kings Pets duo. They're completely optional end-game dlc bosses, why shouldn't they put up a good fight? Fume knight is my favourite fight by far because of the large and unpredictable move set.

<TEXT> Like others here have said, you just need to adjust your strategy a bit if you're used to playing BB. Up your defence game, get your dodge timings down and if you're really stuck go back and farm a few levels.

I find for the Lost Sinner, like most fast, small and aggressive bosses, it's easiest to dodge consecutive hits to the right (their left) and hug them with lock on. (make sure you can at least medium roll with an equip load less than 70%) This way you can quickly dodge behind them to either get in a few hits or heal up before they start the new attack combo. If you like using shields to block consider finding a spear, as you can thrust attack while keeping your shield up with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Learn how to parry if you haven't already got it down. It will definitely help down the road in certain circumstances, especially early game. 

High dps ranged magic or hexes trivialize a lot of the boss fights, if you prefer a challenge/more of a sense of achievement go melee.

And don't fight near wooden chests, if you smash them you lose whatever was inside and just get rubbish..

I appreciate a good soundtrack and I definitely always listen to it the first couple times around, but sometimes it just feels so great when you're kicking a bosses ass to your personal favourite battle jams. For me its Berghain techno or UK dubstep, depending on the pace and the setting. Sir Alonne? battlemarch drum techno. Iron Golem? ass numbing dub vibes. What about you guys? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you like fantasy stories about knights and lords with lots of weapons, armour, combat, power struggles and demons/monsters then you can't go wrong. Also it's Japanese so expect lots of fucked up sex scenes and gratuitous gore/disturbing imagery.

Story is on point though, it hits home for a lot of people. The characters aren't black and white, or pure good and pure evil, which makes things more interesting and less clichd.

<TITLE> Is the Xbox 360 online community still relatively active? For either DaS1 or DaS2? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been through Dark Souls about 7 times now on the same character, love the world and the PvE experience to death but now i'm starting to get bored and want to try my hand at PvP. Only problem is i'm on an outdated system and it's also a bit of a financial commitment since this is the only game I play on console these days. 

So my question to those with 360's is: Is there still an active PvP community for Dark Souls?

Also, i'm neearly done DaS2, just stuck on the Fume Knight. I assume since this game is newer there's still a fair amount of people playing it, is this a fair assumption? I'll try out pvp on both of them if I get live, but from what I've heard from friends the original Dark Souls pvp experience is the way to go.

Any input would be appreciated! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I tried explaining this to some of my mates who aren't into techno and they just sort of stared and laughed. It doesn't really happen with groovier and more percussion based tech housey stuff (which I still love), but a lot of the time when I'm listening to deep, textured rolling techno like Abdulla Rashim, Deepbass, Ness, Polar Inertia, etc I literally just kind of drift off into this weird meditation-like limbo where my mind is completely void of thoughts and the only signals i'm receiving are the shifts in the music and the physical sensations of the bass hitting me. During this time I can usually drift off to sleep in an instant regardless of the volume of the music, and basically everything else melts away until the mix ends or the vibe is somehow broken.

Do you know what I mean?

<TEXT> First off just let me say that I love Adam Beyer as a DJ and I listen to his radio show every week. He throws a great party and his mixes are legendary. However, as a label, he and his fellow artists' releases are just very predictable and similar. Sure I love the Drumcode sound, but it's definitely a formula they rarely deviate from whereas other labels are constantly trying to evolve their sound. Plus like someone else said, time and a place. People on this sub want the gems and rare tracks, not something they can easily find on a top 100 list on Beatport.

<TITLE> The one thing that bugged me about Mad Max: Fury Road (spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-30 11:14:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off let me say that I absolutely loved the movie! I got dragged along to see it not expecting much but I was quite pleasantly surprised both by the quality of the actual action/stunts as well as the intriguing setting and lore. Also loved that we had no lame romantic subplot shoved down our throats. It certainly turned me onto the franchise in general, I'm definitely going to have to go back and watch the others now.

However, I do have one question that's been gnawing at me. At one point in the movie they reach the edge of the Citadel's wasteland and say something along the lines of "we have enough supplies for 160 days of riding" yet it's still implied that they wouldn't reach their destination if they attempted to go that way. If the events of Fury Road are set in Australia, then wouldn't it only take like ~30 days max to cross the entire country by vehicle? Or did they just say 16 days and I misheard them? 160 days does seem awful long...

<TEXT> I am the Dank Lord, Lord of Dank, and I sit at the top of the throne with my gold and silver laurel of hempen leaves and a regal emerald cloak with brilliant ermine trim and silver lining.

At the foot of my throne are my two most loyal protectors, the great and formidable knights Sir Maxime Le Bouclier, Royal Aegis to the Hempen King, and Sir Eric Faucille, The Righteous Eradicator. Both are inhumanly large and wear highly ornate steel armour in the style of late 15th century German Gothic plate. 

As you may have guessed, they fight along side one another as a defender and aggressor, respectively. Sir Maxime bears a great bell mace and gigantic greatshield carved with all of the dope conquests of the Dank Lord, while Sir Eric wields a huge (15') halberd with a intricately carved axe blade on the top bearing the shape of a great hemp leaf. Both bear the kingdoms crest, a golden hemp leaf created using only the most sacred of geometry, upon their jet black tunics.

Beneath them is the Divine Cleric Aitor Laux, the greatest magic healer and sacred summoner in the kingdom. Very little possess magic, and he has been trained from a young age by members of the royal court to only use his magic for the good of the kingdom and his fellow subjects. He does not wear robes because even magic users find plate armour too dank to resist in my kingdom. 

Finally, we get to the main army. At the top is General Staffan Auriculaire, who is at the forefront of leading the Royal Aurian Knights into battle. His right hand man is known only as Sigha, and is one of the most deadly assassins in the realm. He is not known to make appearances on the battleground, but will oft be found alone and outnumbered deep within enemy territory, only to return intact and with his mission carried out. He is one of very few in the Royal Order exempt from wearing the standard royal plate armour, opting instead for tight fitting and dark armour of fine shadowmail, doing little to impede body movement while still offering great protection and camouflage. 

The Royal Aurian Knights are an order of dank knights recruited from every corner of the kingdom. In addition to the standard plate armour and kite shield, the lower ranking knights wear a great helm and carry maces, pikes, axes, and bows. The higher ranking knights wear an ornate bassinet helmet and generally are armed with greatswords and lances or rapiers and bucklers. In addition to the combat gear, each knight also carries a simple wooden gandalf pipe and a fat bag of loud.

<TEXT> Lol I feel like thats why Dark Souls is so well received. It's a game about western fantasy tropes made by Japanese people, so they kinda fucked it all up in the best way possible. It has a certain degree of familiarity but the formula has also been shook up enough that you have no idea what to expect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always been enamoured with the nightlife of the future. I like techno a lot, and I imagine in the future techno clubs (not EDM, there's a difference) will be vastly more popular, especially in North America. 

So while high tech automation deals with lots of the monotonous aspects of daily life, this frees up a lot of time for artists/musicians and party goers, leading to a more developed and sophisticated nightlife culture.

<TEXT> I finally picked up Dark Souls a few months ago and fell in love with it after hearing my coworkers rave about it forever. I'm now on NG+++ and about 150~ hours in. Haven't even gotten to trying multiplayer yet (on Xbox and don't feel like paying for live)

By contrast I picked up Dark Souls 2 SoFS after finishing my first playthrough of 1, played about 10 hours into it and quit. None of the things I loved about Dark Souls made it over to the new iteration. Working at a game store, I have met people who really love DS2 just as much if not more than the original, but I find the overwhelming majority of people say Dark Souls was definitely a more impactful game.

<TEXT> Alright so I'm mostly a house and techno guy but come on who the fuck doesn't like hip hop?

Anyways i've been wanting to round out my rap collection as of late and my question to this sub is what are some of the must-knows of the digital rap world? What are the best places to keep up on both news and releases? 

I love to digitally crate dig and find new music; I know iTunes is usually the go-to place to actually buy the music but sometimes I prefer the more curated sites, ones usually run by the real heads in the scene. Any advice would be much appreciated.  </TEXT>

Combined with the fact that she is broadcasting her rape to the media, granting interviews to anyone who will ask (heres a video interview with Time), and using it to get an easy A grade on her thesis, its safe to conclude that we are looking at a false rape accusation by a mentally unstable woman. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this girl was not truly raped, and instead was sour about being pumped and dumped after giving up her anus to a guy she had the tingles for." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree and personally hope this completely ruins her career. She straight up roasted that woman, that's the kind of shit that makes depressed people go home and off themselves. If only more rampant bitches were forcibly humbled like this maybe the world wouldn't be such an intolerable place for all us "regular folk." 

Not even on my worst day ever would I resort to that kind of language and behaviour, and i'm just a nobody college student not some professional whose entire image is based on public perception. If she was really half as smart and savvy as she's convinced she is she'd have never acted that way to anyone, ever..

<TEXT> Anyone who plays the mainroom at Berghain. I recommend you check out some of the Reclaim Your City podcasts on SoundCloud to see if they fit your aesthetic. It's generally dark and future-industrial but still dancey club techno. It's the stuff the real heads are listening to, straight out of places like Berlin, Tokyo, Rome, etc. Idk if that's your thing or not, but I love it and I totally feel like it fits in with the whole cyberpunk aesthetic.

It's the corrupt politicians who give their powerful friends breaks and enable the ultra-rich to get richer that people have a problem with. Sadly while being a billionaire is great, self made or not... you've gotta face the ethical qualms of having a personal fortune worth more than some countries entire GDP and still actively trying to get more.

<TEXT> To most people it's not the doctors and lawyers that are the problem, but some of the more prominent politicians, bankers and CEOs who really make up the gross wealth gap. 

400k a year is still relative pennies to the super-rich "1%" (more like 0.0001% probably) who take home millions, in some cases billions a year. I say fuck those guys too.. nobody needs that kind of money in a lifetime.

<TEXT> Honestly all DJs have different styles and methods of mixing their music. Some mix straightforward, back to back with two decks. Some scratch or use creative use of effects. A hip hop turntablist is still a DJ, but the methods involved in mixing hip-hop are vastly different than say a 3,4 even 5 or 6-deck purist techno set with loads of loops and tools. 

Unfortunately, typically the bigger a producer DJ gets, the more he has to adhere to a specific sound, the one all the fans who started following him want to hear. That plus the insane logistical nightmare bigger shows have of lining up sets with lighting, fireworks, pyrotech, etc is what generally leads to more predictable "press play" type sets.

<TEXT> I'm a design student with limited extra cash for designer clothes (go figure) so I tend to wear a lot of plain, cheap dark clothes (plain black v's, drop crotch sweats, black slim fit jeans, black converse/high tops, dark scarves) and cheapish techy outerwear (think Superdry). If I had the money, I'd be decked out in DEMOBAZA, Rick Owens, and a Google Glass tho LOL..

You said you take "pride" in being in the know about your students, when in fact you are just monitoring their presence online without their permission or the official request of anybody. The fact that you admitted to needing to find out "who liked the girls ass photo" already betrays your creepy personal agenda.

Justify it however you want but you teachers who stalk students are the fucking worst. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seriously does it go back hundreds of years because of cultural tradition, or did it just start with a couple of furry animators and kind of snowballed from there?

I just find it so strange that bestiality is typically regarded as one of the most taboo forms of pornography, yet humans who dress and act (and in some cases even want to be treated) like cats are noticeably becoming more and more mainstream and acceptable, especially in Japan and amongst Japanese pop-culture enthusiasts. Why is this?

<TEXT> Sorry if this has already been posted and sorry for the quality of the video (There are newer uploads but the original is the only one with english subtitles - plus the shitty translation adds to the humour imo)

Anyways one of my earliest and best stoner memories is getting high for one of the first times and then stumbling across this video with a friend. Since we were both kinda nerdy we understood most of the references and sound clips, and it just made for an awesome random experience when I was young and new to the herb. Germans and I would get along apparently.  </TEXT>
