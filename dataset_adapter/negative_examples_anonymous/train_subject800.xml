<TEXT> There is already an Adventure Time game based on D D, in case you are interested. My Lady Blackbird version is much simpler and narration oriented. I don't have much, just lists with races and classes (including detective and ninja) and some notions about swords, princesses and lands in Ooo. I planned to get all the information I needed from an AT wiki.


Oh, also, it's all in spanish. I could translate it but it would take me a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't recall my typography  lessons very precisely but I think it all started with egyptian hieroglyphs. Complex symbols representing whole ideas and objects got simplified geometrically to represent sounds. This symbols were adopted by cultures like Greece, that were adopted by romans. So, letters evolved in time from very graphic symbols to letters that you can write fast.


I found this picture explaining it. It's in spanish but I think you'll get it.

Se liara la de dios. Muy mal se tendra que poner la cosa para que se usara esa web con el propsito que dices.

Una cosa es que los gobernantes trapicheen a escondidas, tergiversen, hagan circunsloquios y jueguen con el lenguaje, o que los medios distorsionen las noticias como en el juego del telfono roto, no se documenten bien o elijan las que ms les convengan a ellos o a los gobernantes, y otra que un gobierno ponga en marcha un medio pblico, una web, para ir diciendo que un montn de noticias verdaderas son falsas.

<TEXT> I guess I've make some nice things but this is the one that comes to my mind. A fond memory.

I went to the cinema to watch The Two Towers with my best friend. At some moment I lied to him and told him "The movie is ending. See? Galadriel is making a speech, saying all hope is lost etc. They are setting all up for the next movie". And then the battle of Helm came and it was getting obvious that the movie was not ending.
"But you told me the movie was ending".
"I lied! Now comes 45 minutes of an epic battle scene!".
He is a fan of LOTR and epic battle scenes so he enjoyed that surprise like a child. He kept on telling me "Thank you! Thank you!".

It was like I had told him that he was not gonna die, but live one month more and it will be full of awesome sex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The spanish laughing man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv-C2x8TrM0) went viral recently.

He is a very popular guy here in spanish tv. The funny thing is sometimes it's very hard to understand him even for spanish people, since he has a very deep andalucian accent.

[Here is the original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDiB4rtp1qw) with english subtitles, in case anybody wants to know what he really says. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are some good articles about OCD? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-02 19:21:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings, comrades. It's been a while since the last time I posted here. Now I come to you looking for help. I'm thinking about making a post about OCD in my blog, talking about things aspects like what OCD is, what causes it, what kind of OCDs there are, how is the life of a person with this disorder.

I would like some help looking for good documentation. What articles about OCD do you recommend? Which ones you really liked? Which ones did you find well explained and useful?

I could use the wikipedia article, of course, but that's not always the best option and I'd prefer texts written in more casual and "human" style, something less academic. And I could use Google, but experience tells me individual users are more helpful finding good material.

Thanks in advance.

Stay strong, my friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the only paranormal thing that ever happened to me.

When I was in highschool I went through my first severe depression. One night I realized one day I would die and I couldn't do anything to avoid this. My death could happen at any moment and it was getting closer one second at a time. I couldn't stop thinking about death, everyday, everyhour, from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. This was my first obssesive-compulsive episode.

For me, life was absurd, since everything finally vanishes in death. I started questioning myself about the meaning of life, about God and religion.

My family was a disfunctional one. The situation at home was a mess. I couldnt' focus on my studies due to all the shouting and arguments and tv noise. I stayed at my grandparents home for a time. I used to study in my grandfather's office. He is a fan of literature and has hundreds of books. Selfs and selfs full of books.

So one afternoon I got to a moment when I couldn't stand it anymore, I couldn't stand all the anxiety and sadness and confussion. In my mind I have a conversation with God: "Ok, God, if you do exist, if all this, life and existence, has a meaning, send my a sign".

So I went to my grandfather's library, took one of the hundreds of books he has, opened it in one of the hundreds of possible pages, and choose one of the hundreds of possible lines.

It said: "And then, he realized it was all true". </TEXT>

<TEXT> My personal favorites:

-The Shining.

-The Ring, both american and japanese versions, though I find the japanese to be more subtle.

-The Exorcist. I always tell people that this is the only movie that got to really scare me.

-The Saga V/H/S has some flaws but in general is very funny to watch.

-Funny Games, the original 1997 version, it will ruin your day.

-The Blair Witch Project.

-The Poughkeepsie Tapes. Quite irregular, but very scary for some moments. I bet many people have watched it just after find about [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAQNnnfLvkQ).

-Paranormal Activity. That fucking ending though, wtf man, why giving it such a clich ending... Damn.

-Poltergeist.

Edit: I like the first Shyamalan movies too: The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village. After those, Shyamalan turned shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a character from the Hellboy and BRPD comics. If I recall correctly, he was having a spiritism session when a bomb destroyed the house and the people inside. So, his ectoplasmic spirit remained free and was later contained in a transparent suit. He has psychic habilities.

I guess I liked his personality. I prefer the [comic version](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/hellboy/images/5/5e/Johann_Kraus_002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140103030020) rather than the [film one](http://halo.bungie.org/images/johannkrauss.jpg) (Hellboy 2).

<TEXT> My point actually is that true art must not be made to please audience. It must be an act of passionate creation. Letting a lot of people changing your work of art is humiliating.

I mean, I understand that in the serious show business you have to get profits and satisfy your clients but I don't think that counts as sincere and real art. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is one of his best books, because it has the creativity, originality and passion of that young age when he started writing it. It has many unanswered questions maybe because it's more about mistery, poetry and atmosphere than about a definite plot. But every following book gets more and more conventional. The world of this setting and the story of the characters get better explained with more and more details with every book. The last books were almost insuferable for me regarding writing style but I can't deny it's a very very funny and imaginative saga. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would sell the most valuable books, get some money and donate the rest of the collection to a public library. You would be doing something  great for your community and will feel great. If the collection is as big as you say the library could put it in a special section and put it your friend's dad name in his honor. That would be a great way to remember him. I work in a public library and we have a special collection named after a guy that made a huge donation of old books.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I checked the Nightvale wiki: http://nightvale.wikia.com/wiki/Fey

Fey was merely a piece of self-aware software trapped in a heavily-defended metal box

And I guess the following can't be considered canon, since it's from the Thrilling Adventure Hour   Welcome to Night Vale Crossover:

Pemily Stallwark (played by Molly Quinn) is erased from existence. Before returning to existence moments later, she finds herself facing an endless stream of numbers and is forced to read them out loud, briefly breaking into "Roar" by Katy Perry at one point. This was a reference to both characters being voiced by Quinn. A "techno-theological debate" from earlier in the episode over whether or not robots (and presumably computers) have souls may hint that Stallwark is Fey's future reincarnation.

<TEXT> Of course nowadays there are a lot of people against muslims in Spain, not only because of terrorism, but because millions of moroccan people started migrating here, and, you know, people are always afraid of immigrants, specially if they have a different religion and skin colour.

And yeah, while the Al Andalus era there was a real war between christians and muslims, the reconquest, and our hate for muslims comes from that long. 

But I can assure you we don't hide or reject our muslim past. Is taught in the school. I am from Murcia, which was a muslim territory and we still have a strong legacy from them. We have moorish monuments, historical personalities like [Ibn Arabi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Arabi), streets designed by moorish and archeological remains. We even have a festivity called "Moros y Cristianos" (moors and christians) were people dress like medieval muslims and christians knights and courtiers, they make parades an emulate fights and battles. But I must admit I'm not proud of this festivity. It looks like a cheap cultural parody with those cheap ridiculous disguises.

Being that said, I'm not gonna lie to you: a lot of people now in Spain are racists and islamophobics who think that muslims are terrorists that should go back to Morocco.

But Al Andalus, yeah, that is cool for us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll post this here since I think it can be of general interest.

There is a debate going with the OP questioning if the term "pre-spanish" is appropiate. He affirms spanish era started after Al Andalus (moorish occupation in the south of the Iberian Peninsula for 8 centuries). Some of us affirm Spain was Spain before Al Andalus, being called Hispania even before the year 27 b.C. and that there were Spanish people living in the peninsula, people from different civilizations and origins, like romans and visigoths.

So, I asked a friend of mine. He is not a historian but has a degree in classic languages as latin and greek, so he knows one or two things about Spanish history. Here are some interesting points he gave me:

1. As OP affirms, modern Spain was in a great degree stablished after Al Andalus, after the "reconquest" when the Catholic Kings expeled the muslims from the peninsula. The feudal system, the main regions, the catholic religion were stablished then. So, Spain doesn't equal Hispania.

2. It's not so simple. You can't say Spain started being Spain after Al Andalus. Before Al Andalus there were the visigoths, and before them the hispanoromans living there. So Spain would be an equation consisting in: Hispanoromans + Visigoths + Moors / Reconquest.

3. There are books wrote by experts still debating about when did Spain started being Spain, so it's an open debate.

4. There is the idiomatic question. We didn't started talking arabic after Al Andalus, but kept using the same language we used before they came. Spanish comes from latin, not from arabic. It's a corruption of latin, so to say. So, linguistically, we have a "hispanic" identity, although we adopted a lot of words from arabic, like "almohada", "algibe" (just to put two examples) and the name for a lot of rivers like "Guadalquivir".

5. Indeed, you can't deny the Al Andalus era. Nobody is trying to do that. But you can't say Spain as a concept or territory didn't exist before them. It's more complex than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I felt so sorry for him in season 4 that I could barely stand the scenes he appeared on. It made me feel uneasy. I felt like they were extending his suffering and humiliation too much for no reason. But that's just how I felt. I guess I empathized too much with him. This is partially due to a great acting, no doubt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Current 93 - I have a special plan for this world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxZpEFJhO6k) (22 min long)

[Penderecki: Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp3BlFZWJNA)

I can't recall any particular song, but I heard some creepy songs by Diamanda Galas.

And here you have some albums:

[The Residents - Commercial Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdSlFl5H76A)

[Diagnose Lebensgefahr - Transformalin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQNUVTfKQM)

This album was made as a therapy by an ex-depressive-suicidal-black metal artist while he stayed at an asylum. I know this sounds like bullshit. Actually there are many fake rumors about this guy, but this asylum fact seems to be true.

<TEXT> He died because of a cerebral edema while the filming of "Game of death" wasn't still finished. In that movie there is a scene where Bruce gets shot. Maybe that started the rumors.

<TEXT> I work in a public library. It has a big press section. Sometimes they throw away useless or old stuff and sometimes I pick up some magazines or books I can later use to make collages. One time I was attending this section and had a look in the recycle bin. I found a thick old magazine celebrating the anniversary of the death of Francisco Franco -Spain dictator for 30 years. I leafed through the magazine and found inserted in one of the pages a very thin and flexible disc. It turned out it was a compilation of recordings of speeches of Franco through history. National speeches, victory speeches, militar speeches. His galician accent, his special voice pitch and the particular way public figures used to spoke at that time of history makes listening to this a very special experience.

It's the rarest piece of my collection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Death Grips - Ex-military](http://www.discogs.com/Death-Grips-Ex-Military/release/3267383)
One of my favorite albums by one of my favorite bands. Can't be reissued because of copyright problems with the samples they used, so now it's kinda rare. Some copies are being sold for 150-200$.

[Moondog - Moondog (1969)](http://www.discogs.com/Moondog-Moondog/release/926533)
One album I love by a very special man: poet, composer, instrument maker and blind. They are even making a documental film about him. Was re-released last time in 2001. It's 35-75$ now.

[Have a nice life - Deathconsciousness](http://www.discogs.com/Have-A-Nice-Life-Deathconsciousness/release/6024716)
I love this album and it's quite common, but since the original recordings were destroyed by accident and only 128 kbps files were left to use for re-pressings, I'm only buying this when I have a lot of money and can afford it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If that works for you and you are happy this way, go ahead. There have always been recluse, hermit and antisocial people, living appart from society, in a cabin in the woods, or shut in their studios. I know some people that live like this and they are happy. I don't like personally this way of living, but I don't see there is any problem for them.

My concern is, as you say, that this can be bad for young people that have social problems. Some communities are reinforcing this attitudes that can cripple their abbilities and lead to problems like depresion.

Maybe I'm just getting old (I'm 34) and I'm in my new-things-are-the-devil phase. But, honestly, as the years pass, I'm witnessing how some concerning phenomena are appearing as the Internet evolves.

I know, saying "get out and get a social live" can be too rude and cliche, and it's not something so simple to do. When I wrote that I was angry, sad and concerned about these people. </TEXT>

The Lannisters have gold and the throne, the Starks had the Wall and the support of a lot of people in the north, the Tyrells have food, Valirya had strange stuff like valyrian fire and steel... There are many different forces clashing in the saga. And there are some mytical creatures like giants and white walkers and, yes, dragons, but very scarce and as remnants of past ages. They just enrich the story and fit the medieval fantastic setting, but in a subtle way, leaving space for political plot.

Yeah, Daenerys has a lot of stuff but she doesn't know what to do with all that. She is too worried about being the perfect queen and fixing every injustice she finds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe there was a time when "duende" was applied to any form of artistic talent, but today we only use it when talking about a talented flamenco artist. I guess you could use this word while talking about other kind of artists, specially talented people, people with "spirit", or a stroke of genius or artists that captivate you. But, really, we almost use it only referring to flamenco.

<TEXT> I just think its arrogant that you think you're in a place to tell people what to do with their lives

I'm not in 4chan telling those guys what to do. I'm in Reddit telling my opinion about their attitude. My opinion is that they should stop romanticizing social incompetence and hating what they considere is "normal".

and pathetic to react with fear towards people who make different choices than you.

I don't feel fear like this people would come to my house and stab me. I feel fear for the future of this people. I could just not care about them at all, you know, they are probably not even in my same continent. But I'm afraid of some effects of technology on people these days.

What are those choices you say they took? Playing videogames? Smoking weed? Surfing the internet? I have no problem with that. I have a problem with the fact that being secluded and hating social people is becoming a cool attitude in some places in the net. What kind of individuals is this going to produce in the future?

By the way, you don't know me. You don't know what choices I have taken in my life. Maybe you'll be surprised. Maybe I'm too similar to this people I'm talking about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there are two possibilities:

1. The kid died while on the swing. He would have fell off. There is no way somebody dies in such a peaceful way he just keeps sitting in a swing. The mother, for no apparent reason, went crazy at that precise moment, didn't care about his death, sat the kid back on the swing and kept on pushing him until the next day.

2. The kid died. The mom went crazy, couldn't accept it and wanted to play with his dead child a little more. She took the body to the park.

Both are crazy and scary, but the first one doesn't sound plausible to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Commiseration can be nice, I guess. People supporting each other's suffering. Sharing experiences and problems. But romanticizing social ineptitude and perpetuating hate towards well adjusted people is not.

I'm not condescending this people. I'm worried about them. They scare me.

I'm rarely happy in my real life. I have a lot of social and mental problems just like this people. Very often I feel a strong hate for "normal" people, but then I try to remember this hate is not healthy, nor fair or cool. "Normal people" don't exist. It's just a tag I put on them because of my own problems.

I have two objectives:

1) Accepting the way I am. I am shy. I am an introvert. I like quiet and sometimes loneliness. I don't like crowds. I don't like clubs or parties. I'm awkward with women.
2) Improving my social skills. If I don't want to be alone I must learn to relate to people.

And I'm not gonna improve my skills if I have people online patting me in the back and saying: "Fucking normies, am I right?" and laughing at my memes. This can be a very bad influence, even more if you are a teenager. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not implying it's easy. I know well how hard it is. I've been what people call an introvert all my life, and I still am. I have had problems with anxiety, depression and OCD. I've always been socially inept. But something I have learn is that you have to make an effort to change, you have to push your limits again and again, you have to expose yourself to whatever you fear.

I had social phobia. People still scares me. But this started to change the moment I decided I wanted to change, that I had to face my fears, I had to expose myself to people so it would have less and less power over me.

All I say is this "fucking normies" or "normies suck" or "being normal is wrong" attitude scares me, because is spreading and many people seems to really mean it, beyond memes and irony and REEEEs. I fear that the hikkikomori problem could spread to the western world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a certain way, as a non digital native, it scares me that people joke about being just a normal and socially adjusted person. I want to believe they are just joking, but sometimes, because of the things I read, I'm not so sure.

There is nothing great about being socially anxious or having social phobia. There is nothing great in wasting all your time alone at home playing videogames or surfing the web. If you don't feel comfortable at parties or crowds, ok, I understand it, I can relate to that. Don't force yourself to do something that makes you feel bad. But, for god sake, try to be social, get some friends, talk to people, go to some events in your town, get some laid. Either way, you are gonna have a very sad existence.

I want to believe I'm just taking too seriously a bunch of jokes in an imageboard, but sometimes I don't know. People seem so serious about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a former sign language interpreter I must say this girl is making many severe professional mistakes. Things you can be sanctioned for, like lying or removing information. The deaf user could even report her and she would be in trouble. She should translate absolutely everything and don't lie at all. But I guess realism will ruin the fun of the scene.

I wish this was fully subtitled, not only the signs. I could share it with my deaf friends and they would find it hilarious, I'm sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the favorite facts I can think of right now is that they decided to leak No Love Deep Web inspired by Magic The Gathering tactics. Zach's brother is a Magic player and told him about control decks, which basically take control over the opponent's cards and turn them against him. So they got into a simbolic stage of power, the Chateau Marmont hotel, frequented by celebrities, and leaked the album from inside. It's all post-modern magic to me. Epic wanted to control them, so they took control.

You can find better explanations of this story here:

Once she ordered me to write some tale very quickly in the typewriter while she was having a shower. She knew I like to write, so she wanted to make me practise and improve. That was nice.

You're walking. And you don't always realize it,
but you're always falling.
With each step you fall forward slightly.
And then catch yourself from falling.
Over and over, you're falling.
And then catching yourself from falling.
And this is how you can be walking and falling
at the same time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On one session my dom forbided me to close my eyes. I just keeped closing it because I was feeling such a pleasure.

Some time later we switched and she was my sub. I forbided her to speak, a different way of having control on somebody. The thing was she had to speak in sign language. I was a sing language interpreter then and I was teaching her, so it was like practising for her. It was incredibly cute to see her so quiet and trying to communicate with me with her hands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played my No Love Deep Web record while practicing a method my therapist taught me for releasing my anger and anxiety. It consists in hitting a phone book with a piece of plastic pipe while you scream.

So, No love was blasting, and I was hitting the phone book as hard as I could, following the ryhtm of the beats, shouting things like "I'm not gonna be sad!" and "I'm gonna be happy!".

Later I got interested in magick and occultism, so one day I tried to practise my own purification ritual. I wrote in my arm "Do what thou wilt, shall be the whole of the law", and in my leg "Love is the law, love under will" (both quotes from The book of the Law by Aleister Crowley). I cut my hair while listening to Beware. Cutting my hair had always some kind of symbolism, like leaving the old stuff behind and starting a new phase. 

I can assure you I felt quite powerful, like I was doing something really meaningful or, at least, different, as Manson spoke in the intro. Then I took a shower. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me and my best (girl) friend are huge fans of AT and sometimes we meet and watch the new episodes. After that we use to discuss and get to the same point: the show is getting more adult. AT started as a children show, but it got a lot of young adult fans, and they have to adapt to that. Adults want more complexity, more mature themes, deepness, sub-plots, story arcs.

But I wouldn't worry. I think the show will always preserve its touch  of innocence and be children likeable. Even in the most serious episodes, a lot of fantastic and absurd things and jokes happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think /u/powerlanguage is the responsible for this experiment, but the explanation you need about the button is much more elaborated.

Sigh... Long story short: There is a button at the top of r/thebutton. Only people with Reddit accounts created before 1 of April can press it. You can press it only once. When you press it, you are assigned a colour depending on at what time did you press it. People are giving these colours religious/mythical/ideological meanings.

Everytime somebody presses it, it restarts from 60s. It has never got to 0.

The button looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/Mpi2qdN.gif

Just read a bunch of threads. It's actually very funny and you'll get the story very quickly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have this problem too. I can't have an orgasm while having sex with a girl. I have to masturbate. When in home, watching porn and masturbating, there is no problem. But this seriously makes my relationships very awkward and frustrating. I lost my libido. I used to be obssesed about sex, but since I take my medication, I totally forgot about sex. I rarely masturbate.

I quit with some of my medication, antipsychotics to be precise (paliperidone, I think) and I have recovered some of the libido. Now I masturbate more regularly. I haven't been with a girl since I quit the pills, though, so I don't know if I'm still fixed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a music blog where I share and review albums. I'm still not very good or professional with the reviews but these are some things I've learned:

-Listen the album at least two or three times before you form and opinion.

-Write about the artist/band origins and story.

-Tell some interesting details/trivia about the album, the artists, some story behind them. For example, I'm very interested when some of the members of the band died or commited suicide. I don't know. I'm just like that, interested in morbid details.

-Have in mind the album's historic relevance, how important or influent it was for other artists at the moment of its realease. Maybe you'd listen Black Sabbath or Venom and find it bland compared to other contemporary albums, but at the moment they were pioneers, the first of it kind doing that thing.

-Explain how the music makes you feel. Its flavour. Its texture. Make metaphors.

-Read other reviews in famous sites like Pitchfork, Rate Your Music, etc, but also in less known blogs or Youtube channels.

I hope this helps you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminds me that time, when I was like 18 years old, I was home alone and somebody called. It was a girl.

"You, sir, are a killer", she said, in a very convinced and funny tone.
"What?"
"You, sir, are a killer", she repeated.
"I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about".
"Well. You will find it tomorrow then".

She hanged up.

I'm 34 now and still have no idea what was that about or who she was.

Now that I think it, maybe I should even tell this in its own thread. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't worry. You are not a bad person or a pedophile just for having those thoughts, that seem just intrusive thoughts caused by your OCD.

Imagination is free. Mind is free. Just thinking about something doesn't mean you are gonna do it or you agree with it, specially with thoughts that you can't control.

Indulge yourself. Imagine whatever you want. You are free. Your mind can't hurt anybody. Your actions do. Don't be scare for your thoughts. That's just your mind trying to fuck you.

I've had problems like yours. Sometimes I see little children and imagine raping them. But I know I'm in no way attracted to them. I would never do anything inappropiate to a kid. I know that's just my mind looking for another way to make me feel bad, like when I imagine accidents or think again and again about that person that insulted me on the street.

Have a conversation with yourself and make things clear. Take a decision about your feelings and grasp to it whenever you feel insecure about these thoughts.

I hope some of this help you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure people relate OCD to not being capable of finishing works. Maybe they could think you are just obsessive and meticulous, that you have some rituals. That's the most extended view about OCD, I believe. You shouldn't worry.

<TEXT> I once listened to Guillotine on my ipod while I was visiting the cathedral at my town. It's quite monumental and peaceful and has a lot of history behind it. The contrast between the violence and profanity of DG and the sanctity and peace of the church was very interesting.

The cathedral looks like this in the inside:

<TEXT> Do you think the magician was high while performing the tricks? I thinks DG have experimented with drugs in some of their videos, like Pillbox Hat, where I'm sure Stefan took some hallucinogen that made him experiment through various emotional states.

Maybe this is something that they found cool. "Hey, get high and try to perform your tricks. We will record you for our next video". Maybe that's the reason why some of the tricks are so poorly performed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a similar problem riding my bike. I always imagine a car appears out of nowhere and hits me. I imagine myself falling, breaking my bones and smashing my head in the road. Following to that, I use to imagine my testimony in a trial, explaining how the accident had place and defending myself. Also I use to imagine myself arguing with some drivers that find I'm a nuisance in the road.

(fuck , my english is so poor right now...)

I've had this obsessive thoughts for years, but lately they have decreased in intensity, I got used to them, partially thanks to the help of my therapist. I've learnt to accept this thoughts as a part of me and not get upset  about them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it has been helpful for me.

First of all, talk helps. You blow off steam and you put your thoughts and feelings in order as you talk.

Very probably, you won't only talk, you'll do therapy, you'll do practical exercises with your doctor that will help you evolve.

I've been through three different therapists in my life and every one of them have helped me solve different problems. I'm not perfectly sane now but I wouldn't be who I am today if not for them.

In the other hand, you need to be lucky and find the right doctor. Some of them are not very motivated or just try to push you on pills. Be careful with pills. They can be helpful if you have real problems, but they have some side effects they don't talk you about. You can get fat, or feel numb or sleepy, or just feel neutral and devoided of any feelings. Pills are not the only answer for everything. I know some people who had some problems and tried going to a therapist, and the first thing he did was prescribing him pills. He declined and later solved his problems himself without medication. But not everybody can do that, of course. Some people really need medication.

Try to make your doctor to inform you about your medication, to tell him what are you gonna take, and why, what the pills do, and what side effects they have. You have the right to be informed. There are some things that your therapist won't tell you if you don't ask. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm happy for you. But be careful. If you start to feel bad again, don't be scared. It's something natural. Don't feel it like a failure. Remember that's a state you know well, and it can't get worse than you alreadey has experienced.

I say don't be scared because recently I had an axiety attack after a long period of feeling really great, and it felt terrible. I was terrified about going down again, I felt like I was going crazy. But I didn't.

One of my therapist warned me: I was doing a great progress but I could have bad moments again. She said sometimes your mind is resilient to stay stable and happy because you have been feeling bad for so long, and you are used to it.

Anyway, good luck. Take advantage of this new state and make some plans to organize and improve your life, so you stay happy as long as you can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meds, therapy, life experience and getting older, mostly. I've been through three different therapist. Every one of them have helped me changing different problems. These changes have reverted in my daily life and my self-perception, making my mind more clear and calm, reducing symptoms like rituals. Also, I think i just grew older and learnt some things that help me have things more clear in life. I still have depression, anxiety and self-steem problems, but much softer since I'm going to the last therapist.

Also I've been under anti-depressants and antipsychotics for many years, and I guess they are in some part the reason of this changes. But mostly, therapy and learning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm much better now, but still have intrusive thoughts. Whenever I'm riding my bike I imagine an accident, a car hitting me, falling to the ground, smashing my head. Or I imagine other drivers complaining about how slow I am or my erratic direction.

The more usual thoughts are negative ones, about how wrong everything is, how badly I do things, all my mistakes and faults. My mind is always looking for reasons to feel bad and guilty. Whenever I do something, there is a voice in my head whispering: "You are doing it wrong. YOU are wrong".

The worst ones are about raping little kids. I know I would never do that nor I'm attracted to that but just having those thoughts popping on your head automatically whenever you see a little kid, damn, it's scary. Luckily this kind of thoughts are not usual anymore.

When I was a teenager I use to have rituals like touching things the same amount of times in the left and in the right. I was obsessed with simmetry. I could spin a jar to the left, then feel obligated to spin it to the right to balance things. Then again to the left, but in a minor angle, again to the right... and so on until the handle stayed in the center.

In hindsight, I think I'm getting better every year, so I still have hope and so you should. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually I'm seeing a therapist again (a new one) partially because I was having too many suicidal thoughts and me and a friend were getting worried.

Now I don't think about it so much, I guess I got little better. But not long ago I was thinking again and again about ending it all. About the final solution. I usually thought about it when I felt depressed or useless or anxious or lost, but this thought came also to my mind in some strange moments. I remember one day visiting a friend and his girlfriend. I was playing on his XBox and he was in the kitchen making cheese sandwiches. For a moment I felt so out of place I suddenly thought "You have to kill yourself. You just have to do it. There is nothing else to do. That's the right solution". 

I think this is the weirdest moment I had this thought.

But yeah, suicidal thoughts, a lot. Whenever I felt that I couldn't stand this anymore, this state of perpetual sadness and anxiety. That would end the suffering, but I don't want to quit struggling. I want to fight till the end. I want to see it all and feel it all, even if my life ends like a big fail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you are alone in your house, try having a rational monologue. Not a mental one. You have to use your voice. Release energy and frustration. If you have to curse, curse. If you have to yell, yell. But be rational. Rationalize your problem. Give yourself questions and answers. What's the problem? Can I find a solution? If not, what I'm gonna do about it? Try to take out all that is in your mind, so later there will be less things to think about.

I'm not a therapist. I'm talking from my experience. Sometimes talking about an obsession and rationalizing it helps. Later there will be less things to think about because you already have come to some sort of conclussions.

Talking with a friend helps too.

It's possible that the obsession continues, though, but try it at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The basic concept around Unknown Armies is that you can have power but it has a high price. The more you sacrifice, the more power you get. There are, for example, epideromancers, who must hurt themselves in order to gain magic charges.

There are also "demons". Rumors say if you can summon one, you can make him help you, give you power and information. But: 1. They just want to control you. 2) They are not really what people think they are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try to face your triggers and your intrusive thoughts, as long as you can. Don't let them have control on you. I know this is easier to say than to do it. I mean: don't fear your problems, accept them as part of yourself, at least of a temporary self. Expose yourself to your fears, alway as far as you can and under your control. Focus on your intrusive thoughts, don't try to cut them out your mind. If you fight something it becomes your enemy. Try to accept what you feel and think. The problems will not disappear but maybe they will be easier to stand and you'll relax a little.

These are some things that I read in a book my therapist recommended me and worked in my case. I hope they work in yours. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is pure-O? Is the first time I've read about this term. Maybe is because I'm from Spain and here we use another terminology or maybe because my therapist have been trying to not use thechnical terms with me so I wouldn't obsess about them.

Is it just a mental obsession? Like something without rituals or compulssion? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could just tell your parents you feel anxiety and have problems focusing on school, or even maybe that you think you have some kind of OCD symptoms, that you overthink things and have too much "mental noise" to focus on your work and want to improve your marks. You are not obligated to tell them exactly what kind of disgusting thoughts you have. Keep that to yourself and your therapist.

About things being normal again, well, I'll talk from self experience. Is very dificult for a person with mental illness go back to total normality forever. If you go to a therapist and have the appropiate medication you can get really better and have a better life. Your symptoms can weaken a lot, but accept that maybe now and then they can come back for a while and have a bad time. But very probably your thoughts will turn into a minor nuisance.

I've have intrusive and obsessive thoughts for years. I'm going to therapy and taking medication and now I'm much better. I still have the same thoughts about accidents when I'm riding my bike, for example, and imagine how somebody assaults me while I'm walking in the street, but they are weaker now. Sometimes I have an argument with somebody or feel very guilty about something, and that ruins my whole day. I fall in a depressive spiral and spend the rest of the day in the bed. But this happens very ocasionally, now.

What I'm trying to say is you can get better, but maybe you'll still have some symptoms or bad times, now and then. One thing I've learnt going to the therapist is to accept the way I am, to accept my intrusive thoughts as a burden or nuisance, to not obsess about them.

Another thing Ive learn in therapy: exposure therapy. Face your problems. Expose yourself to them. Look, triying to analyze or rationalize your bad thoughts is like trying to turn off a fire with gasoline. You are just feeding the machine. Instead of falling in a rational feedback, fighting thoughts with thoughts, focus on them. Look them to the face. Repeat them in your mind again and again. Surrender, don't fight. "Okay, you want to think about this? Let's think about this". Repeat the bad images in your imagination again and again, this time under your own will and control. The pictures appear because you want. Verbalize them, turn them into a simple sentence and repeat it again and again and again. Your brain soon will get bored of this, the thought will loose control on you and you'll pass to something else.

Problem is, this technique can turn into another obsession. It's effectiveness is temporary.

You are still young. In a pair of years you will feel much better. I'm 34 now. Started with therapy at 24 and I've evolved a lot. I'm not a perfect man but I got much better. Not saying you'll need so many years for your therapy, but be prepared to be pacient with your therapist and yourself.

I hope I helped you in some way with this brick I just wrote. :) </TEXT>
