<TEXT> The story has 173 comments.  Do you think the readers of /politics think the story is "off topic?"  So am I correct that the only political stories nowadays that can be posted to /politics are stories about Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump?

<TEXT> From the story:  "Mrs. Clinton has made support for gay people one of the cornerstones of her presidential campaign."  This was a political act to attempt to secure the votes of the gay community.  If it had been "nonpolitical" then we would never have heard about Mrs. Clinton's post because she would have sent a private message instead.  And her campaign certainly wouldn't have publicized the missive by sharing it with the world on Twitter.

I noticed that you've only been on reddit for a couple of years and a moderator for far less time.  I think you should run some of the posts you propose to delete by a more experienced mod before you act.  It makes me think that you have a particular political bent and are simply deleting stories that don't fit within your bias. </TEXT>

Therefore, every GI, sailor, airman and marine who participated in the unjust wars against Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, et al, did so by choice.   They committed war crimes to further the political, religious and economic interests of a select group of elites whose only goal is to promote U.S. hegemony and empire.  They do not deserve admiration or thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Rehosted content" is an article or opinion piece that is cut and pasted by a website from an author-authorized publishing source.  Ron Paul authorized antiwar.com and other websites to publish his original columns and therefore this was not "rehosted."  You may want to check with more experienced moderators that have been on reddit for more than two years before deleting articles and columns in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you will delete any post of a Eugene Robinson column that isn't directly linked to the Washington Post website?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Ron Paul has been writing columns for antiwar.com since its inception.  Don't bring your own political leanings into moderating.  I'm sure you would have no problems with a "rehosted" column written by Elizabeth Warren. </TEXT>

But Mike says the senator is planning a high-profile pitch at the National Defense University this fall to address his critics, and attempt to reposition himself on the foreign policy spectrum.

Hes going to argue that hes smack in the middle - the same place that George H.W. Bush was, that Reagan was, and that Ike was, said Allen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Webbs latest allegations and the other new evidence in the matter could also have implications for the Texas governor, Rick Perry, a strong supporter of the death penalty and a possible Republican presidential candidate.

In 2004, Perry refused to temporarily stay Willinghams execution despite the report of a leading forensic expert that sharply disputed the finding of arson by a Texas deputy fire marshal. Perrys administration has also repeatedly undercut the authority of a state Forensic Science Commission, which agreed that the arson finding relied on flawed analysis. Defending his handling of the case in 2009, the governor declared that Willingham was a monster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The NYT article makes depressingly, horrifyingly clear that we remain very, very far from becoming adults, if by "adult" we mean recognizing certain unalterable facts of our existence. Our politicians, our military personnel, and many Americans still refuse to face honestly and completely the reality of what the U.S. did in Iraq, just as they refuse to recognize the blood-drenched reality of U.S. foreign policy in general. It is inconceivable that any of the catastrophic consequences of our actions, including the suffering of U.S. military personnel, should be our own responsibility. We therefore blame anything and anyone else, including the victims of our own crimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "What it makes me feel is deeper guilt," said Mike Prysner, an anti-war activist who, at 19, was part of the 2003 Army invasion. He served in Iraq for 12 months and left the service as a corporal. 

"One of our roles was to shred their national identity. What is happening today is a direct result of the U.S. occupation's strategy," added Prysner, 30. "I remember the Iraqi government being setup along ethnic lines by the U.S. occupation. I remember arming certain ethnic groups to fight others. I'll live the rest of my life knowing I was a part of that."  </TEXT>

David Hacker, a demographic historian from Binghamton University in New York, has recalculated the [Civil War] death toll and increased it by more than 20 percent  to 750,0000.

<TEXT> You're actually wishing that the Axis had conquered Eastern Europe 

Actually, if the USA had never entered the ETO, it is less likely Stalin would have "conquered Eastern Europe."  Hitler then could have concentrated more forces on the eastern front thereby preventing Stalin from advancing to Berlin.  Over time, the Russians would have pushed the Germans out of the USSR but probably wouldn't have had the political or military will to set up the Communist eastern bloc buffer zone that eventually rec'd the Allies' tepid blessing.

the wholesale extermination of Eastern Europe

If you're talking about the extermination of the Jews and other minorities, please remember that the USA did not go to war with Germany to stop what became the Holocaust.  In fact, [FDR was turning away ships with Jewish refugees as late as May of 1939](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267).  Here's one passage from the article:

"Sailing so close to Florida that they could see the lights of Miami, some passengers on the St. Louis cabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking for refuge. **Roosevelt never responded**."

So perhaps the "miserable racist fuck" you're thinking of is one of America's most beloved presidents.

put a bullet in your head, you fascist fuck

In fact, as a libertarian anarchist I'm the exact opposite of a fascist.  My guess is that your views are much closer to those of the Nazi party.  You probably support torture, endless war against Muslims and other suspect non-white peoples, rendition, domestic spying and the collaboration between govt and corporations in advancing the interests of the state.  I seriously doubt that you have ever advanced the notion that American society would be much better off if it embraced the principles of liberty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendant now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> David Coombs, Mannings civilian defense lawyer, opened by describing an incident in Iraq on December 24, 2009. A US military convoy, traveling along a roadway, forced a vehicle carrying five civilians onto the side of the road. They struck a roadside bomb.

At Forward Operating Base Hammer, where Manning was stationed, he and other intelligence officers watched the event unfold. The other soldiers erupted in cheers because the US forces were unhurt, Coombs said. Manning was disturbed. </TEXT>

Take an 18 or 19 year old.
Send them off to a needless, futile war in a country and culture they know nothing about.
Force them to observe brutality they had never conceived.
Have them watch their buddies be slaughtered and or maimed for life.
Send them home, where life goes on and no one really understands the profound change in their life and perceptions.
Let them deal with the VA bureaucracy that is consistantly overwhelmed and underfinanced. Have the VA delay or deny their rightful claim to disability.
Have republican members of Congress vote against a Veterans Employment Bill.

Combinatons of the above can induce suicidal ideation and action.

Most effective solution? Stop perpetual war for oil and private profit

<TEXT> if you want an endless war, sure, let's keep afghanistan in a perpetual state of domestic conflict and completely ignore the eerily similar events of history.

Intervention by foreign powers has caused all of the problems you're referring to.  What Afghans do in their own country is not now, nor has it ever been, the business of the United States.

You have to understand that you have been brainwashed by your employer with these phony arguments in order to get you to kill people who have never posed any threat to you or your country.

A missile screamed down from the sky, killing the two men instantly. Two chunks of shrapnel flew at Bacha Zarina and lodged in her left side.

Her family raced her to the nearest hospital, a half-hour's drive away, but she died en route, an accidental victim of the rapidly escalating U.S.-led campaign of drone strikes in Afghanistan. **She was 14 or 15 years old.**

<TEXT> U.S. foreign policy is aggressive, reckless, belligerent, and meddling. We dont need a foreign policy that strikes a balance. We dont need a foreign policy that we can afford. We dont need a foreign policy that is like Reagans. We dont need a foreign policy that is less interventionist. We need a wholesale repudiation of the past century of an evil and murderous U.S. foreign policy.

<TEXT> He didn't state in that clip that he would be the sole judge of whether an actual rape had occurred.

Have you ever read the newsletters?  The language in them is typical of what was being said by the Right after the LA riots and hardly "racist."  In fact, he has said on numerous occasions that he has some moral responsibility for what was published.

Ron Paul is simply stating that there has to be some evidence of an actual (he uses the admittedly more clumsy word "honest") rape b/f he would *personally* agree with any measure to stave off a pregnancy.

<TEXT> The reason for the silence about such matters, and the reason commentary of this sort sparks such anger and hostility, is two-fold: first, the US likes to think of terror as something only "others" engage in, not itself, and more so; second, supporters of Barack Obama, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, simply do not want to think about him as someone who orders attacks on those rescuing his victims or funeral attendees gathered to mourn them.

That, however, is precisely what he is, as this mountain of evidence conclusively establishes.

The Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Nimitz agreed: "The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in their defeat." Admiral Leahy, President Truman's Chief of Staff, concurred: the atomic attacks were "of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already ready to surrender" </TEXT>

Hiroshima and Nagasaki were targeted largely b/c there were significant *civilian* populations and b/c they had not been destroyed already w/ conventional bombing.

<TEXT> The military has not tortured anyone legally, you are thinking about the CIA.

So, I guess you're saying the CIA is and has always been running Bagram Prison, Gitmo and Abu Ghraib where torture was routine? And, I don't think it was the CIA who tortured the Afghan taxi driver to death in the documentary *[Taxi To The Dark Side](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/taxi-to-the-dark-side/)*.

President Roosevelt ordered the bombing of Japan

Actually, it was Truman, not the deceased Roosevelt, who ordered the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Japan (who was far from defeated).

Then I guess you [disagree with Gen. Eisenhower](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) who said about Truman's decision to drop the bombs:  "I was against it on two counts. **First, the Japanese were ready to surrender**, and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon."

[Admiral Leahy](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): "It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. **The Japanese were already defeated** and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons."

[Gen. MacArthur](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): [MacArthur] replied that he saw **no military justification for the dropping of the bomb**. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor."

hatred of the military

I hate pointless mass killing and destruction.  Unfortunately, the U.S. military is an eager participant in both of these activities.  The U.S. military does not protect freedom, it endangers it. If I'm wrong, tell me how I am more free today than I was prior to 9/11 or the Iraq War.

You routinely attack countries who do not threaten America nor ever could, you've killed literally millions of people in unnecessary foreign conflicts around the globe, you have tortured and continue to torture helpless individuals at secret prisons at the behest of the President, and, to top that off, you dropped city-destroying nuclear bombs on a nation that was already defeated in WWII.  Look at your real history, not the fanciful mythology you've been brainwashed with, and my guess is that a military acting on its own won't seem like such a far-fetched idea.  </TEXT>

Huh?  I've never heard that our military saved Ethiopia and Indonesia.  You'll have to educate me on that one.

yes we do fight..we do it well.

This just isn't borne out by the facts.  The U.S. military hasn't won a war since WW2.  It lost in Iraq and will lose in Afghanistan.  There is a difference between sowing destruction and death and victory.

criticize the way those liberties are provided

Liberties are natural rights.  Govt doesn't provide liberty.  Govt can only reduce or destroy liberty.

Better men than you or I have died to give you liberty and while criticism is the duty of all in a democracy

U.S. military personnel do not die to preserve liberty or democracy and haven't since (arguably) the American Revolution.  In fact, their actions abroad only serve to reduce liberty and democracy at home (see the TSA and our pointless elections).   They die normally to preserve the financial interests of certain elite groups such as the oil industry or the military-industrial-Congressional complex.  If you don't believe me, then just read [*War is a Racket* by Smedley Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_is_a_Racket).

<TEXT> name one country that we have annexed or taken in the last 50 year.

We tried to annex Iraq (remember the 100s of bases George W. Bush wanted?) and we're trying to continue our "enduring presence" in Afghanistan.  We still occupy Guam, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Japan, Germany, Italy, England, Djibouti and God knows how many other countries.

I have traveled extensively in many countries and have never seen any place where the presence of the U.S. military has had a positive effect.  Of course, nearly every country has benefited from American innovcation and technology, but this would have occured independently from American occupation and bombing.

places where American influence has a been such a good thing

Its a shame. The important issue is [what] the two candidates seem to agree on. They dont really disagree with militarism overseas, they dont disagree with the Federal Reserve system and the bailouts, and they dont disagree on basically whether the role of federal government is wealth redistribution through welfare. So instead, theyre talking about tax returns and that to me is so disappointing, he said. Its all a charade, I think its all contrived to not have a debate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rand wants to eliminate tax "loopholes."  This is the equivalent of raising taxes and Ron Paul has said as much.

Rand wants more *govt* spending on infrastructure.  This is exactly what Obama advocated when rallying support for his $800 billion "stimulus" program.  And nowhere in the interview does Rand ever state that he wants to *decrease* govt spending of any kind.  Ron always brings up reducing spending, particularly overseas.

Rand wants to make sure the behemoth and unconstitutional govt programs Social Security and Medicare are around for another 75 years.  Whenever Ron is asked about these programs, he always states that we need to transition out of them, not keep them around for another century.

And BTW, no one likes a tattletale.

Wherever they find incipient conflict, they are eager to exacerbate it, sustain it -- and feed upon it...Almost invariably, the policies adopted by the imperial managers (of both parties) make the conflicts worse, fomenting extremist resistance and ever-more violent repression: a deadly cycle that benefits no one -- except the "masters of war." </TEXT>

<TEXT> In another event that calls into serious question the Pentagons unfailingly positive view of US progress in Afghanistan, the US military was compelled to acknowledge that it had significantly underestimated the seriousness of an incident that took place Wednesday, when a man drove a truck onto the runway at the Camp Bastion airport in Helmand, just as the plane bringing Defense Secretary Panetta was arriving there.
 
**It has since emerged that the individual driving the truck, which had been stolen from an Afghan soldier, was an Afghan interpreter working for the US-led occupation**. He died on Thursday from severe burns suffered when he apparently tried to ignite the vehicle. **Pentagon officials admitted Thursday that the interpreter was trying to run down a group of US Marines assigned to meet the aircraft.**
 
The incident underscored both the lack of security in an area supposedly secured by the US surge, as well as the continuing proliferation of so-called green-on-blue violence, the term used by the US military to describe attacks against it by Afghan security forces that are supposedly its allies. </TEXT>

The two American officers who were killed were shot in the head and the pistol used to kill them was **equipped with a silencer**, the officials said.

Afghan officials said that Mr. Saboor was at large, apparently **able to leave the ministry without complication after the shooting**. That suggested to some observers that he may have had help in the attack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cant believe in 2012 the federal government is raiding Amish farmers at gunpoint all over a basic human right to eat natural food, said one of them, who asked not to be named but received weekly shipments of eggs, milk, honey and butter from Rainbow Acres, a farm near Lancaster, Pa. In Maryland, they force taxpayers to pay for abortions, but God forbid we want the same milk our grandparents drank. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the comments section: The analysis of Mr. Mallon is good, except in regards to his comments on Ron Paul's foreign policy. Endless war and the gold standard don't get along very well. There is no way that this country can ever return to fiscal solvency as long as we have the oversears empire. For 100 years the USA has tried to be the policeman of the world. The Federal Reserve and our endless over seas entanglements started with Woodrow Wilson. It is time to drive a stake through the heart of Wilsonianism. End the Fed. Bring the troops home. Concentrate on this country and let the world run itself. Wars always lead to high inflation and high taxes. Greenspan and Bernanke though that they could get us through these wars without either. Well we see how that turned out. </TEXT>
