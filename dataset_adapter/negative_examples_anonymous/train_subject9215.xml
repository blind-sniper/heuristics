<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Macs are expensive, we all know that. But in Europe they're crazy expensive and in February or March the prices increased 300 due to the U.S. Dollar. My thinking is that apple would sell a ton of MacBooks if they were 300-500 cheaper. The first thing I hear people talking about macs are how expensive they are. Then 15" for example starts at 2300. Sure with student discount it costs 2.100 but it's still ludicrous. If it was 1800 I'd be all over it. </TEXT>
