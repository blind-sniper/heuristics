<TEXT> I travel about 175-225 days a year for work while keeping my health. It's not easy but my rule is,  decent filling breakfast (yogurts,  fruit,  etc).  Lunch is usually provided for me,  but keep it small. For dinner never a starter or desert. Just a main course and a coffee. Pick something light. 

Exercise wise: body weight training for at least 30 minutes a day,  if the hotel has a gym,  use it. I also go for a 30 minute run every morning before the start of the day (depending on location,  if it's a safe place I am visiting I will go for a run,  if not I will do it in the hotel gym,  if no gym available,  no run,  but 30 minutes of jump robe in the hotel room or garden). 

Take it easy with alcohol. Better yet,  don't drink during weekdays (hard in some cultures).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 3 years ago I ate at Jiro. Made reservations 3 months before and postponed my trip a week to make it happen as fine dining is my number 1 hobby and I aim at at least 2 Michelin stars a month (2*1 or 1*2) and know quite about about good food. 

I would like to point out that almost all of the quality is from his son. Jiro does some QA but that's about it. Honestly I believe his son will take it to a higher level when Jiro steps back completely. Jiro did the first 25 miles of his sushi marathon,  but his son did the final stretch. 

If you aspire to eat there bring between 400 and 600 USD a person (depending on the exchange rate)  and be aware that this is not a place where you sit down for hours. It's pretty much in and out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> White wheat flour bread actually has a higher glycemic load than refined sugar. 

Pure white flour has a glycemic load of 66

Sucrose has a glycemic load of 68. 

White bread has a glycemic load of 70

You're better off munching 100 grams of table sugar than munching on 100 grams of white bread.

You cannot buy the device outright for 199. You still pay the 25 Verizon Edge over 24 months. 

The phone got a 199 discount,  which still pretty sweet. You did not get it for free. 

You kids need to grow up and realize the price of the phone is calculated into your monthly fee.

Also: I had my liquids in a zippy bag. Zippy bag was apperantly too big for the security guard. So she put the zippy bag with content in another (clearly not a 1 liter zippy bag) and was quite content with herself. What's the point?

<TEXT> Remember that a 40$ bottle of wine sold at a wine importer will sell for 150-200$ in a restaurant. The factor is anywhere between 2 and 6 times the purchase value. 

These restaurants don't make much money on the food. If you have 40 seat,  but also employ 20+ kitchen staff,  plus front house staff,  including a matre and a sommelier that will make absolute bank if they are half decent,  you need to win it back on the wine.  </TEXT>

Cue the evening and we're in a 2 Michelin star place. I'm looking at a 400 food bill without wine and she orders a 300 euro bottle of wine for herself. 

Now I would have paid, but she was a total cunt. It became very clear that she was pulling this shit often to get free fancy meals. 

Ate my food,  didn't drink the wine (driving). Got up. Paid for my food and the bottle of water I had and told the waiter we were going Dutch. He laughed,  gave me my receipt,  I tipped him 25% and left. 

No clue what ever happened afterwards as I didn't pick up the 67 missed calls and blocker her on Facebook.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greece would to well to make their country a good place to settle as a company. Make labour laws more entrepreneur friendly, reduce the ridiculous worker rights the Greek people have been giving themselves (really, it's out of hand). Make it a beneficial place tax wise (corporate taxes hardly matter, give people money and they will spend, tax income), give away lands for FREE or very cheap to businesses willing to settle (happened a lot in the Netherlands in the 80's and 90's for example).

Of course the government only goes so far. The Greek workers need to understand that they are not all little saints with rights that others would dream off. Yes, you are important, yes you need to do your part. Take your loss, help start building your country. </TEXT>

Luckily they get a few months of unemployment benefits (60% pay) and then welfare because the EU and Putin have a squabble, I'm sure they'll understand when they are unable to become employed in their field as our economy is also on it's ass.

<TEXT> Loaning money doesn't work like that. And the Greeks need to understand.

"Forgive old loans and give us new loans." basically translates to 

"Forgive old loans and give us free money that you will never get back." 

A better compromise would be (which I still don't stand behind, but still)

"Forgive us part of our old loans and invest in our economy so we can move forward". 

A long time ago during my bachelor studies I was in a project group named "Trade not Aid"  where we helped European companies invest in Africa. No free money, no loans. Setting up businesses and letting the locals make money. It worked very, very well.

<TEXT> In my opinion the referendum is just there to make the people think they have a say in this. They do not. Every single action so far has been in the direction of "We need more money, we promise to pay it back, also lend us more money so we can pay back the previous lender." It's like a pyramid scheme on national level.

What the Greek people and government need to do it turn very frugal, start to learn to live on the welfare level they can afford. Reform the economy (I mean, really, what does Greece have? Tourism and limited agriculture?). Exploit upcoming markets. They have tons of sun and wind, become the number one net exported of Green energy in the world. I'm sure that the EU would be willing to help pay for that. Create the best damn tourist place to be you can. Last time I was on holiday in Greece it was terrible, I would not return. etc etc.

Go frugal, live a life that you can actually afford, reform, create a unique selling point. It is hard, and I certainly do not know HOW they should do it, these are just my ideas, take them for what you will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to be a very vocal "Grexit" proponent. But I feel more and more pity for the Greek people.

It's all a giant clusterfuck of failure. First politicians scammed the people and the EU into joining the Euro. Then everything goes to shit. Then they elect a government  that cannot possibly solve this issue. 

We (the EU) should have let Greece go years ago. It would have been cheaper for the EU, and less painful for the Greek people. The bitter pill would be there, but a whole lot less bitter than it is now.\

My guess: Grexit before the end of the year with very limited impact to Europe, and near third world levels of poverty in Greece. </TEXT>

Fortunately we have a joint venture in China. We ship the 99.9% ready product to them. They tack on some extra nameplates and upload the software (made in the EU) and ships to Russia.

And believe me, we are not the only ones. For us it is either this, or close one of our factories, firing approx. 500 employees, our margins are already razor thin as it is due to competition from lower cost countries.

The only ones that are screwed by this are smaller companies, farmers, and other agricultural companies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you've been living under a rock. Most of their services and products are top notch now.

Surface tablets are incredible. Windows Phone is actually working very well (albeit with a small app store). Holo lens is the same as black magic. XBOne, like it or not, is very good (then again, so is the PS4), Outlook.com works well. OneDrive is better than most alternatives. Office is still king in both home user and corporate environments and works very well next to it being industry standard. On top of that, Windows has been very stable for the past few years and besides thinking that a mobile inspired UI would work on desktops (later fixed) I have very little qualms about it. At least it's more innovative than regurgitating OSX iterations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually according to Dante the most "terrible" hell is pretty much an ice lake.

 Ninth Circle (Treachery)
 The ninth and last circle is ringed by classical and Biblical giants, who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery.[55] The giants are standing on a ledge above the ninth circle of Hell,[56] so that from the Malebolge they are visible from the waist up. They include Nimrod, Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy), Briareus, Tityos, and Typhon. The giant Antaeus (being the only giant unbound with chains) lowers Dante and Virgil into the pit that forms the ninth circle of Hell (Canto XXXI).
 
 The traitors are distinguished from the "merely" fraudulent in that their acts involve betraying a special relationship of some kind. There are four concentric zones (or "rounds") of traitors. These rounds correspond, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of liege lords. **In contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery, the traitors are frozen in a lake of ice known as Cocytus, with each group encased in ice to progressively greater depths**.

<TEXT> Coincidence or freak of technology.

In 2011 I was sitting in a bar in Tokyo and another western man came in. We had a chat. Never exchanged full names, professions, just the regular bar/beer/sports banter.

Two weeks later he is in my "People you may know" section on LinkedIn.

I was thoroughly freaked out. I'm guessing we both logged in on LinkedIn from roughly the same area and the systems recognised it as a non-standard location and decided we may have been at a conference or whatnot. </TEXT>

People need to grow a thicker skin and get the fuck over race. The more you talk about it, the more important it (as in race) it becomes. We're all human. Some of us are just a bit more dark to deal with warmer and sunnier climates.

On that note. I find the sun extremely racist! It burns my pale complexion much more than my black brothers and sisters. Someone make a petition on change.com to make the sun less racist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8 years ago a crazy ex decided I was physically stalking her. 

Don't mind the fact that I was 5000 km away and never contact her. 

After doctoring "evidence" and presenting it to the police (it later turned out the detective was a family friend) it sort of worked and I had to present myself to the public prosecutor. I had my lawyer write a letter and the case was dropped. 

Too bad that shit stays on your record for 30 (or 40, not sure) years here. And every goddamn insurance ever ask you "Have you have something on your criminal record that happened in the past 8 years". If you answer No, you're committing fraud. If you answer Yes you go in the special pile, with higher premiums.

No shit. Want to fuck someone over. Get them indicted in a case. They'll be fucked regardless of guilt.

(The Netherlands by the way).

Some justice porn by the way: She also tried to rob me blind in a civil suit. Which I won. She is still paying me damages and legal fees. It takes a long time on welfare. </TEXT>
