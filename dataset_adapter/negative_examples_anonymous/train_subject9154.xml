<TEXT> Yes there are many names for it. Circle of death is one. I like the idea of the beer tab...brings a bit more excitement into the game. You're drunk...trying not to pop the tab..and BAM..it break and you're chugging. Some of the rules change as well like what each mean. When I only play with 4 people I change 8 to Trivia. bc it's not enough for a "mate"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Playing style differs depending on region I have found. This is how I play it. 

We put a can of beer in the middle of a table and surround it with a full deck of cards without the two joker cards. 

Each person sits around the table and gets on turn each. You pick up a card and depending on what the card is- is what you follow- each card has a rule or activity that must be performed. When you are done with the card you place it under the beer tab....the person that makes the tab burst must chug the beer....

**Rules** 

1. Aces= Waterfall (Everyone starts drinking/chugging at the same time...but the person to your right cannot stop until you do, and his person to the right cannot stop until he does..and so on...So if you are last...it sucks- To determine which way the you start the waterfall from your left or right I usually ask a common question -Common such as *What beer are we drinking?*- between the person to my left and to my right. The one who gets it right I start in his direction, making the loser..last) 

2. Kings= Rule Master (You can make whatever rule you want...such as "little man" "no Names" and every time you break the rule you must drink) 

3. Queens= Question master (Anytime the question master asks you a question you must answer with a question and so forth until someone doesnt and that person must drink- some people only allow this once others allow it until the next queen is shown) 

4. Jacks= Thumb Master (The person who gets this card puts his thumb on the table and the last one to do it must drink) 

5. Tens- Categories (You choose a category such as "Countries in Africa" The person who fouls up must drink) 

6. Nines= Rhyme Time (You pick a word and go in a circle and you must rhyme...if you don't or you repeat you must drink) 

7. Eights= Pick a mate (Everytime you drink your mate must drink with you) 

8. Sevens= Heaven (You raise your left arm and the last person to do it must drink) 

9. Sixes= Dicks (All males must drink once) 

10. Fives= Social (Everyone takes a drink) 

11. Fours= Whores (All women must drink once) 

12. Threes= For me (You must take 3 drinks) 

13. Twos= For you (You must pass out two drinks) </TEXT>

Not really. Kevin and his parents were entertaining, honestly. I can deal with stupid. What I couldn't (and can't) deal with is the politics and just general morale shitshow that is modern education. I got tired of being micromanaged and continually blamed for things that were out of my control. Kevin was honestly a fun part of my career.

Kevin graduated in June and now works at a restaurant about 15 minutes away. He has a 2 year old son and AFAIK, is getting married to the mother(also graduated in June). From what I hear, he kind of grew out of the stupidity and having the kid kind of sobered him up. His future FIL is military though, so that probably had something to do with it.

It comes in waves and happens more when I post in more active subs. I'd say 2-3 times a day it comes up on here. Usually I don't respond if it's not relevant, but I like how you formatted it :P

He slept in class a lot, or at least kind of just made vague attempts at doing work while either not paying attention or attempting to flirt. In fact, most of the events happened between August and November, or May and June. From December to about mid-April, he was pretty low key...when he wasn't suspended or lost." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I try to use it to splat as much ink as possible: depending on the map. In Kelp Dome there are certain areas enemies won't touch for 30-40 seconds when I inkstrike it. 

A few seconds of them cleaning up an instrike is worth it because it's more time they arent supporting teammates or pushing. I stay away from snipers, only on Moray Towers do I use it to move a sniper. But mostly I use the Ink Strike on Moray to strike areas around the top of their tower because hardly anyone ever goes down that more than once. People just run away from their home base and hardly ink it, it's always not inked all the way, lot's of black spaces on lots of maps. 

Or if I am near an enemy at Bluefin I will InkStrike the bottom platforms and they will move out of the way towards me so I can kill them because they have no where else to go- either into the inkstrike and die or towards me and die. While this area will be eventually cleaned up I also leave an Ink Mine there so when they do come to clean it they might die to the mine. Or I leave them in blind spots and go somewhere far away from it. Or...lol if I make the mistake of jumping into an enemy i place a mine right away before i die and then they die </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said they were more special. I said having sex in a dumb way and getting someone pregnant is not the same thing as a sperm donor. Because it isn't. They are completely different. 

I never said it makes them their parent either. I said it makes him the kids father...because it does. He is their bio father. The woman...still has the kid, it is her kid- she is giving birth to it even though she is drunk but the guy dips out..but he's just as much responsible for it as she is. So he's nothing more than a coward. A sperm donor is nothing like that. He offers his sperm knowing exactly what is going to happen with it, and signs release forms saying whether or not contact is allowed...etc They are not the same at all. The guy who dipped out is still the bio father- he just dipped out bc he's a coward. </TEXT>

It takes time to go to the areas to ink to get enough energy to use your special- in that time you could have been doing the same amount if not more inking than what your nuke was worth. So I'm not entirely sure it is worth it- In the beginning yes, because everything is clear so it's easy to get special right off the bat but in the middle of the match it puts your team down a person allowing the other team to push while your off trying to get your special.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This one event didn't cause you to lose.  Don't just sit and cherry pick. Have multiple areas where you can shoot. 

I don't ever use beacons and I don't ever plan to. That being said I never jump where a teammate/enemies are. If I jump, which is rare, would be if my teammate is some place advantageous or it's the end of the game. 

Beacons are a waste of a sub because hardly anyone uses them, and the enemy just destroys them fast. As soon as I see an enemy beacon on my game pad that's the first place I go. Or I just nuke it. 

I try to stay as far away from people as I can and just splat the ground for turf war because that's the object to win the game. In splatzones I do the same, I make sure the splatzones are splatted and don't worry about killing people unless it's in defense or completely necessary. The most important thing is the area to be splatted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I'm not the best shooter in the game but I've figured out a way to move up in ranking. 

I play one game per session online. If I win, I don't play any more ranked games till the next time I play Splatoon. 

If I lose, I get a new team, and play till I win. Then quit. This results in me having two end results at the end of a Splatoon session: 

1. My point/ranking stays the same
2. I move up +10 or +12 or whatever I get. 

I Have used this to move up from C to B. I have never gone 0-7 though in ranked or 0 anything in ranked. Sometimes for Tower Control I'll go like 10-16. In splatzones it's more like 6-5 or 5-4. 

I changed to this style because if I play too many ranked I get frustrated by my team at times. Now I don't get as frustrated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. 


Kids have been trained for most of their lives to think of my gender as the authority.

They might have learned it at an early age when assertive girls were smacked down with labels like bossy "bitch" (see Lupe Fiasco's Bad Bitch song)  a reality that recently spurred the Ban Bossy campaign.

They might have learned it from watching media that rampantly objectifies women, often blurring the line between mainstream media and pornography.

They might have learned it from consistently seeing men over represented and women underrepresented in positions of power.

And I benefit from all of these lessons as a male.

<TEXT> K. Here are some examples. 

As a male....I

1. I Have the Privilege of a Gender That Confers Authority

2. I Have the Privilege to Show Skin- That is men can take their shirts off and not be called sluts, whores..etc 

3. I Have the Privilege to Move About Without Fear of Harassment, Assault, or Rape

4. I Have the Privilege to Enjoy the Internet Without My Gender Being Assaulted

5. I Have the Privilege of Seeing Myself Widely and Positively Represented in the Media




**If you want more**

The Male Privilege Checklist

1. My odds of being hired for a job, when competing against female applicants, are probably skewed in my favor. The more prestigious the job, the larger the odds are skewed.

2. I can be confident that my co-workers wont think I got my job because of my sex  even though that might be true. 

3. If I am never promoted, its not because of my sex.

4. If I fail in my job or career, I can feel sure this wont be seen as a black mark against my entire sexs capabilities.

5. I am far less likely to face sexual harassment at work than my female co-workers are. 

6. If I do the same task as a woman, and if the measurement is at all subjective, chances are people will think I did a better job.

7. If Im a teen or adult, and if I can stay out of prison, my odds of being raped are relatively low. 

8. On average, I am taught to fear walking alone after dark in average public spaces much less than my female counterparts are.

9. If I choose not to have children, my masculinity will not be called into question.

10. If I have children but do not provide primary care for them, my masculinity will not be called into question.

11. If I have children and provide primary care for them, Ill be praised for extraordinary parenting if Im even marginally competent.

12. If I have children and a career, no one will think Im selfish for not staying at home.

13. If I seek political office, my relationship with my children, or who I hire to take care of them, will probably not be scrutinized by the press.

14. My elected representatives are mostly people of my own sex. The more prestigious and powerful the elected position, the more this is true.

15. When I ask to see the person in charge, odds are I will face a person of my own sex. The higher-up in the organization the person is, the surer I can be.

16. As a child, chances are I was encouraged to be more active and outgoing than my sisters. 

17. As a child, I could choose from an almost infinite variety of childrens media featuring positive, active, non-stereotyped heroes of my own sex. I never had to look for it; male protagonists were (and are) the default.

18. As a child, chances are I got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hands just as often. 

19. If my day, week or year is going badly, I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether or not it has sexist overtones.

20. I can turn on the television or glance at the front page of the newspaper and see people of my own sex widely represented.

21. If Im careless with my financial affairs it wont be attributed to my sex.

22. If Im careless with my driving it wont be attributed to my sex.

23. I can speak in public to a large group without putting my sex on trial.

24. Even if I sleep with a lot of women, there is no chance that I will be seriously labeled a slut, nor is there any male counterpart to slut-bashing. 

25. I do not have to worry about the message my wardrobe sends about my sexual availability. 

26. My clothing is typically less expensive and better-constructed than womens clothing for the same social status. While I have fewer options, my clothes will probably fit better than a womans without tailoring. 

27. The grooming regimen expected of me is relatively cheap and consumes little time. 

28. If I buy a new car, chances are Ill be offered a better price than a woman buying the same car. 

29. If Im not conventionally attractive, the disadvantages are relatively small and easy to ignore.

30. I can be loud with no fear of being called a shrew. I can be aggressive with no fear of being called a bitch.

31. I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest, since that kind of violence is called crime and is a general social concern. (Violence that happens mostly to women is usually called domestic violence or acquaintance rape, and is seen as a special interest issue.)

32. I can be confident that the ordinary language of day-to-day existence will always include my sex. All men are created equal, mailman, chairman, freshman, he.

33. My ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is.

34. I will never be expected to change my name upon marriage or questioned if I dont change my name.

35. The decision to hire me will not be based on assumptions about whether or not I might choose to have a family sometime soon.

36. Every major religion in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex. Even God, in most major religions, is pictured as male.

37. Most major religions argue that I should be the head of my household, while my wife and children should be subservient to me.

38. If I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are well divide up household chores so that she does most of the labor, and in particular the most repetitive and unrewarding tasks. 

39. If I have children with my girlfriend or wife, I can expect her to do most of the basic childcare such as changing diapers and feeding.

40. If I have children with my wife or girlfriend, and it turns out that one of us needs to make career sacrifices to raise the kids, chances are well both assume the career sacrificed should be hers.

41. Assuming I am heterosexual, magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with images of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually. Such images of men exist, but are rarer.

42. In general, I am under much less pressure to be thin than my female counterparts are. If I am fat, I probably suffer fewer social and economic consequences for being fat than fat women do. 

43. If I am heterosexual, its incredibly unlikely that Ill ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover.

44. Complete strangers generally do not walk up to me on the street and tell me to smile. 

45. Sexual harassment on the street virtually never happens to me. I do not need to plot my movements through public space in order to avoid being sexually harassed, or to mitigate sexual harassment. 

45. On average, I am not interrupted by women as often as women are interrupted by men. 

46. I have the privilege of being unaware of my male privilege. </TEXT>

There's a scene in the film, which takes place in NYC, where three gay guys are having a threesome and one of them uses his mouth like a trumpet and sings the national anthem in another guy's ass. It's graphic and shows all of this. [Here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367027/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

I have to say, the saddest death was watching that Assistant get taken away by the dino bird, then eaten by the water monster with the bird. She was eaten whole so you have to imagine she was alive while being in the stomach of that thing for probably 2-4 minutes before drowning.

<TEXT> /r/counting is a subreddit where you count things. For instance, they have a long going thread of counting numbers which started with 1 a few years ago. Then someone replies to 1 with "2" and so forth. You cannot reply to yourself. 

They had so many replies in a thread once that it messed with reddit's servers so now each thread in the count can only be 1000. So every 1000 counts, they start a new thread. Right now I believe they are on or around 430,000

There are other threads which count not just numbers like they have a count letters thread which starts with AAAA. The next would be AAAB, then AAAC....till AAAZ..then you would go AABA.. and so forth until you finish with ZZZZ. 

There is also counting with Binary numbers, counting palindromes (same backward/forward) only, evens, odds, counting subreddits. If you can count it- you can make a post which starts the count. 


Here is their [current thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3du07m/428k_counting_thread/)

**[]Lynfect 5580 points 3 years ago** 
Cousin died when we were both seventeen. There was a reception at his house just after the funeral. I went into his room and stole all the money that was there, took some other valuables that his parents wouldn't realize were gone. No one knows that I did it, they just assumed he didn't have any money in his room, only loose change. I don't regret it, but I will never admit I did it.
Also my cum box.

that is his answer
























**and someone...with patience and professional language said in return, "]eeeeevil 3842 points 3 years ago 
Elaborate on this cum box, please."**

His answer: 


Well, it is exactly what it sounds like. It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it. I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.

Because people were asking, my greatest shame.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.

EDIT 3: Fuck, this really exploded. ~20,000+ views of my cum box. Did not expect this.

Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. New picture.

I will never be rid of my need for it. I hate and love the box, just as I hate and love myself.

<TEXT> I suppose this one time my friend got really drunk and made himself a sandwich. He wanted to show it to me, his creation, but first he had to finish creating it. When he was finished he waddled over to me and showed me what he said was a Tuna Sandwich. In reality, it was miracle whip, mayonnaise, and grape jelly all in a gross mound between two pieces of bread. Then he ate it and his dog licked up everything that felt out of the back end of the sandwich. It was really gross. Also, my friend showed me the cumbox reddit post. That was odd.  </TEXT>

It's the number 1 rule that unfortunately still gets broken. Attraction is different yes, but I always remember that these students are younger, and developmentally not on the same level. Even when I was 22 and I had an 18 year old student. They just looked like students. I never saw them as an attraction.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No dude. It is not. It is YOUR OPINION. You have already lost because you think an opinion is fact. I know the definition of a fact. What you have stated is not a fact. It is your opinion. Trying to give your opinion weight by calling it a fact is disingenuous  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not a fact. That is your opinion that it can. It is not FACT. 

Opinions can be supported by facts- but what you have said is not a FACT, it is an OPINION. A fact would be listing statistics (ex: The results of the statistics are...) - the opinion would be the interpretation from those statistics which is "Age disparity can create a power imbalance" The key word being "can" 

You can keep calling it a fact all you want but it is simply your opinion. Calling it a fact doesn't add any more weight to your sentence. I'm not saying I disagree with your opinion, I agree with it kind of, but it isn't a fact. An opinion is defined as indicating a belief, view, sentiment, conception, which is what you are doing. 


It's a common problem people do when they are taking to give more weight to their opinions they say "The fact of the matter is..." or "The fact of..."  They are trying to give more weight to their opinion by stating it as fact- it's not though. It's just an opinion. It's an expression in the English language and a bad habit as it misinforms people to believe the follow statement is fact rather than the opinion that it is. 

Now before you argue further, I have a degree in English. I taught literacy and I most certainly know the difference between fact   opinion- but what you have said is not a FACT. 

I'm not disagreeing with the content of what you said, it just bothers me when people say something is a fact when it's just their opinion. Kind of like how some people get bothered when someone misspells their, they're, and there.  </TEXT>

Anyway, her roommate, we'll call her Cynthia, was dating this guy named Steve who liked to play WoW a lot. No problem there, I played UO and Dark Age of Camelot, I like MMORPGS, we even all used to play Munchkin card game together- lots of fun. 

Anyway, The issues I have with WoW are that Steve, when we were all out getting to know each other bowling or some random double date, he says he has to go because there is an all important raid to do. 

This is why I dislike WoW. You're out in the real world with your girlfriend who wants to give you some pussy and you have to go on an emergency raid for some random item you might have a chance at getting.

<TITLE> Tecmo Bowl (Story) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-18 04:58:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of my earliest memories of playing video games was playing Tecmo Bowl and soon after Super Tecmo Bowl. In Super, it was the only game i could have the Browns win the Super Bowl, which I know will never happen in real life because of God. 

Anyway, I used to play my brother in Tecmo Bowl ALL THE TIME. Every day after school, Tecmo Bowl. Homework done? Tecmo Bowl. Can't sleep? Tecmo Bowl. I also had a black and blue arm for about a year of my life playing this game because every time I scored points my brother would punch me as hard as he could for every point I scored to deter me from winning the game or scoring points. He was five years older than me. I was conditioned into thinking I'd be punched for scoring points. So much so that when I grew older and tried to play Madden online I'd flinch if I scored a field goal or touchdown against someone. 

At this time, this is when I realized that people suck and there is no hope. So I played RPG's instead. Where I could solve puzzles instead of scoring touchdowns. This is my story of Tecmo Bowl. And fuck you Joseph.  

**TL;DR   Brother punched me for scoring points. Fuck you Joseph.**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I hardly eat- I have Crohn's Disease incredibly hard to gain weight with all the blood and shit that comes out of my ass. Reddit banning a subreddit shaming fat people does not deny you free speech. 

Free speech only means congress will not make a law denying you the ability to say what you want. Free speech doesn't mean Reddit, a website, can't ban a subreddit if it wants to- if the guy who made it or whoever runs it wants to do it- they can. It's not much different than a mod banning someone for saying shit either. 

The only guarantee you have with free speech (with the exception of libel) is that you won't be prosecuted for what you say- it doesn't mean you won't get fired from a job, have a website ban you...etc

<TEXT> Your free speech isn't lost. Free speech only means the government won't make a law limiting what you say (with the exception of libel, or words that present clear danger). So...you can still say whatever you want- but that doesn't mean it won't get you banned on a website for it. 

Why should I care if Reddit bans a subreddit about hating fat people? My freedom isn't being taken away. That doesn't bother me. Good for them. This is there website- they made it- they can do whatever they fuck they want with it. 

If you don't like that- why don't you just make your own the way you want it? That seems like a good solution. You can find ANYTHING on the internet. My freedom of speech isn't being limited. It never have. Just because this person disagrees with you doesn't make them ignorant nor myself and it doesn't make me shortsighted. 

You are foreseeing a trickle down where "banning subreddits against fat people...well shit...next i won't be allowed to 'fag' or 'fuck' on this website and anywhere on the internet...my life is doomed!!" 

I think you're overreacting a bit and foreseeing a future that will not happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't disagree Graf had amazing skills, but not any better than Serena's skill. Yes she won 22 slams before she turned 30, but did she win any when she was over 30? No. I think that's impressive when you consider at what age most women retire in tennis. It's even more impressive when you consider her dominance at her age. It's not like she just won one or two close ones after she turned 30, she pretty much revamped her career.  </TEXT>

You mean for disorderly intoxication? He pulled a fire alarm. That's why the officer's arrived at the scene, his wife was too drunk to be left alone so they took her until she sobered up and could care for herself. I live in SWFL and all they did was put him in the drunk tank until he was sober which is just 8 hours. He wasn't charged. They took him for disorderly intoxication- that's pretty normal down here in SWFL since we get so many tourists. There's nothing wrong with that. Had they not pulled the fire alarm for no reason the cops wouldn't have came at all. By the way, you can get in trouble for pulling a false alarm too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We can be shit buddies. I shit a river of blood and you shit Hawaiian Lava hills of fresh stink. 

I once created a rap song. A couple years ago (mind you I can't keep a beat and I certainly can't write). I had this ex girlfriend who had OCD of her feet being touched. Whenever someone touched it, she had the touch the other foot exactly the same then clean them off as they were 'dirty'. For example, if you splashed on foot with water she had to splash the other. So my friend (a drummer) made a beat and I wrote some weird lyrics and we made a weird music video for it.

<TEXT> Makes sense to me. Sniper weapons don't ink as much. I don't think they are good for Turf War format. Honestly, anytime I have a teammate with one I just disconnect. I played for a long time and it's just horrible They go like 2-12 with 2-400Pts. Very little ink. They just sit in one spot and try and snipe people. Even if they move around inking they don't ink a lot. 

So like I said, I understand your opinion. That's cool. I got no problem with differing opinions. I just disagree.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me I have a few things. 

1. Being able to change weapons while you wait for the game to start instead of going to the lobby. 

2. I get annoyed at teammates that use the sniper guns for Turf Wars, they don't splat a lot of ground which is evident by their points, and they don't even get a lot of kills to make up for it. It's a good gun but not for that game type I don't think. 

3. Not having Turf Wars be on ranked as well. 

4. Being forced to play splatzone or tower control instead of being able to have the choice to play one. I don't want to have to wait 4 hours to play tower control. 

5. More maps in rotation than just 2. 

6. Teammates that super jump to your area when you're in the middle of mayhem and they die instantly by the enemy just pointing their gun at the circle where they're jumping.

<TEXT> So my friend and I were on Skype and decided to play some Splatoon. Now whenever we do 'friends' we are only on the same team maybe 10% of the time- dunno why. So today we were against each other 19/24 games (I kept track). We were at the Saltrig so we went to one particular spot stopped and saw each other and just splatted in front of each other the entire game hahaha. 

It was so much fun. We gave away our teammates locations to each other if they were jumping in. If my teammates jumped in I would run block if they tried to kill him and he did vice versa. 

It was a nice change up and a fun way to do something different. I'm pretty sure the 6 people playing with us hated us, but I don't think they ever figured it out. We get about 1800 each just splatting in front of each other over and over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. Thank you for your response. As a user and a mod of a very small subreddit I want to say thank you for your candor and apology.  

I have a question for you. I am not trying to be mean or insulting or anything; however, can you please step down from Reddit? The majority of us do not want you running Reddit. Can you please step down? This is something that would be considered a great action on your part. This is a way to back up your promises. This is a good solution I think. I know you mean well, but you're just not working out well for us. You've had many chances to correct things and you have not. As a result can you please leave? 

The way your team handled this situation with mods and the firing of Victoria and everything the past year or so, is reason enough for you to step down. What has been done on here by your team cannot be made up with a simple 'text' based apology.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe. There's no real way to know that for sure. He has a shot in the democratic primary. It will either be Hillary or him. 

Look, in 2008, I worked on Obama's primary team and no one thought we had a shot over the Clinton machine either....but we won. You can win an election with a very good ground game. 

A lot of people assume that candidates win- with how they make sense of what issues people find important. The truth is, in the ground game for campaigns, rarely do you ever talk about issues. It's all about numbers. They say you gain a vote every 3 houses you talk to people. So we knocked on insane amounts of houses. To do that, obviously you have to have a substantial amount of dedicated volunteers and also you need to have a good program to use to print up all of the people who voted which way and what way in the previous primaries and a good software system to input all of the data. 

When we won the primary and I worked on the 2008 general election one thing I noticed versus John McCain was he had less volunteers on the ground and they wasted time when they went door to door. (this is just in the area I worked in Ohio). They would argue with someone to vote for McCain at their house for a good 20 minutes. If someone tells you "I'm voting for the opponent no matter what" You don't spend 20 minutes trying to convince him you move on. In those twenty minutes, you can hit 5-6 more houses. It's just a waste of a time to argue. Rarely did I ever speak about the issues with people because I didn't want to waste time- only if I thought was it worth it and I always explained why I was voting for him and for people to make up their own mind. In addition, in my area the McCain volunteers were at odds with the Republican Party volunteers (for local elections- republican party wanted to take many mccain volunteers and use them for local campaigns...) Also, they didn't work on Sundays where I was at. Which is fine- I get the reasoning behind that but while they weren't working we worked 24-7. 

Sanders has a good following if he can turn that into thousands of volunteers working for him- he has a shot. Primaries are state by state- it's certainly doable. If he picks up momentum watch out

Republicans have a good shot to win 2016 as well- if they pick a solid candidate. Romney wasn't good and while McCain was a solid candidate his VP hurt him. I think- it would help them if they changed their platform on marriage equality. that likely wont happen though </TEXT>

This sniper was up on one of the pillars at Kelp Dome picking us off so, lol, I just went the long way around snuck up from behind and BAM. It's fun surprising people, it's why I like the Ink Mines. I always like running up to people and plopping it down for a suicide kill.  </TEXT>

And I played for like 10 hours once on a binge so I got A LOT of gold. I bought all the clothes. Don't know what else to do other than buy an amiibo to do those challenges. It's fairly easy to get lots of gold quick. There's nothing to spend it on so it keeps saving.  </TEXT>

12 Sea Snails is cool but what am I gonna do with them? I already have 500K gold, it's not like I need to talk to Spyke for anything.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great. What is his proof besides "someone close to reddit?" Sorry man but you see lots of that stuff. It's all speculation. 

We don't deserve to know because it's not professional for a business to disclose why they fired an employee. It doesn't matter that we use the site and generate posts or not. That is irrelevant in the firing of an employee for a business. It sucks she got let go, was a big mistake by Reddit. But it is not our business to know why she was let go, it is our business on what they are doing to rectify the situation and their mistakes.  </TEXT>

Yeah, it's a shame the mods turned the community private, but so it goes.


It's not a shame some mods turned the community private. The shame isn't on the mods, it's on you guys. The responses you're giving back to people aren't positive it's just the same old BS. The firing of Victoria is not our business- I get that- we have no business to know why- just so you know, she was good at what she did and you will not find someone as good as her. 

I've been on reddit a while on this username and my others, but this has made me question quitting reddit. 

Again, it's not a shame the mods stood with solidarity over being treated poorly. Reading your official response, it's just so smug and arrogant. It's like you think you can easily appease people with that crap </TEXT>

fair is a veritable smorgasbord orgasbord orgasbord

After the crowds have ceased 

Each night when the lights go out

 It can be found on the ground all around 

Oh, what a ratly feast!

Melon rinds and bits of hotdogs 

Cookie crumbs and rotton cotton candy 

Melted ice cream, mustard dripplings

 Moldy goodies everywhere

Lots of popcorn, apple cores 

Bananna peels and soggy sadwiches 

And gobs of gorgeous gook to gobble at the fair

A fair is a veritable smorgasbord orgasbord orgasbord 

After the gates are shut 

Each night when the lights go out 

It can be found on the ground all around 

That's where a rat can glut, glut, glut, glut! </TEXT>

This statement makes no sense. "I did not have an awful home life, but was emotionally and physically abused" 

You understand why these statements are contradictory right?

Also,

<TEXT> Well I explained in my first comment. But I can explain again. 

A daughter will watch her mother and how her mother is treated by guys and how she deals with the situation. She will watch how her mother, and in this case, how her mother deals with her brother and then she treats situations with men similarly. So let's say she doesn't call the police and just doesn't want her brother to get into trouble because of this- even though it is very serious stuff. If she has a child- that type of behavior/attitude will be passed down her child and so forth. It's learned behavior. You think it's normal because that's what you've seen from your parent(s) your whole life so it becomes your norm. 

At some point, you have to break the trend. 

But she deleted her account so I'm guessing it was fake. lol </TEXT>

And you don't have to teach sociology- you can teach history, poly sci, or other social sciences at a high school level, public relations at a business, Human Resources at a business, senior or youth service centers. 

Lots of things you can do. And there are many resources to help you find those jobs as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hijacking top comment. 

I just found this post. You need to call the police and file a report on your brother. This will only continue to get worse for you if you do not. It will become a cycle. Where things may get better then get worse until it blows over, then get better, get worse...etc 

You may not be able to see this now. But accepting his behavior without calling th e police or enforcing consequences for his actions/words will affect your relationship with men for the rest of your life. 

It's important to do what you can to get away from him, not just for your sake but like the comment here, to help other people and other women in his life in the future.

" I mean, I dont want to get him to get in that big of trouble. "  He needs to get in big trouble. I know he's family but this behavior cannot be encouraged. 


Counselor here.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear Falling Skies,


I have been a fan of your show since the first season. I have been most disappointed with this season and yet I will continue to watch the show because now I am unfortunately invested in it.
A couple things. I get that the alien's name is Cochise, but when Tom Mason says it it sounds like goat cheese or coat cheese. As a result it has become increasingly annoying to me that every time Tom Mason talks about goat cheese or to goat cheese he says his name. I saw in last weeks episode they said "goat cheese" about 15-20 times in the show. It's annoying and is really ruining the experience with the show.


Secondly, please kill the Lexi storyline it's awful. This whole season has been so fragmented like you had an idea then abandoned it and changed your mind. It's been strange. Also Moon Bloodgood's character has been written has increasingly annoying. She is a good actress don't waste her talent on such trivial lines that make her sound so whiney. Please.


Lastly, stop saying goat cheese's name so much. Please. It's not necessary. I know who he is! Or perhaps you wouldn't have had to do that if you didn't make the alien's from each race all look like each other. Humans all look different. Logically from an evolutionary standpoint it would make sense that other alien races would not all look identical. Some wouldn't even be the same height. This is a common theme in film and television with aliens and sadly you have not learned from their mistakes on this issue.


If you have not listened to anything I have suggested please listen to only this: Stop saying "goat cheese" so much. Seriously quit. It ruined last week's episode. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well. I DCed once. I am in the middle of inking and then I see the ink come out of the gun but it doesn't render on the ground. Then I got DCed. I don't know why I would DC though, my internet is fine. 

It's just frustrating, I want to a play a full game without someone quitting, or randomly being DCed. 

You think they will ever do a free for all? 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1?? </TEXT>

Okay. I give up. I love this game. But that is the 5th time in 9 games someone has DCed. I also got DCed twice, and I've checked my ISP, I have very fast internet and the only thing I'm using it for is this game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It just seems kind of crappy that we lost team points in ranked when someone DCs. You can't win a 3v4, I've never seen it. It's very rare. 

It's about 4 out of 10 games this happens.

It's only with Splatoon I have this issue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone have constant problem with connection? My connection is fine, it works great and I never have any problems but about 35-40% of my matches someone always has a disconnect problem and it starts us with 3 people so it's 3v4 and then we lose terribly. Or it happens to the other team, same thing with ranked games. 

Wondering if anyone else has problems in games like this. 

Do you think they will at some point fix it so when someone disconnects your team won't be penalized?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> no. you can unlock everything in a week basically. Even the stuff on single player  "hero mode." 

It's a great game except there's only two types of games to play. Splat zone- ranked or turf war. That's it. You can't do turf war on ranked, and you can only play with friends on regular games and you may not be on their team because it is randomized. 

They have a wide variety of weapons and armor/clothing to wear, but only 8-9 maps and you can only play 2 every 4-8 hours until they change them. Every time you open the game the splat sisters talk and you have to scroll through their repetitive talking every time they change courses, which is fine a couple days- then it gets annoying and you can't skip it. 

The upsides are that it is seemingly a fun game. However, they are 4v4 matches so if someone loses internet and it's 3 v 4 you will assuredly get your butt kicked.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak for someone I do not know. Mirroring your behavior is a common counseling technique though, such as what you say, we call it re-framing or summarizing. Might be different than what you are describing. 

I can't speak for a counselor who I do not know but if you felt like she was coming on to you, then I am sorry. That should not happen in our profession. It's in our ethical codes and standards that we not have dual relationships like that. It's harmful to the client. And most importantly our job is to advocate for our client. So I can see how that experience may have not helped you any. Not all counselors are like that, if she was indeed doing that, again I can't speak for a situation I had no part in. 

I can't speak to her mannerisms or the way she counsels, maybe that's just the things she does? With her hair, lip licking, mirroring, necklace touching...I really don't know. 

It's not unheard of for a counselor to check up on a client once they have terminated their sessions. She could have generally been concerned, again I do not know. 

I always tell clients that they can tell me anything, so if they had an attraction to me and told me. I would thank them for telling me, I would go over the part in the ethical standards with them and then I would refer them to another counselor. At that point, the relationship would have been damaged. It really depends how severe it was. But it would make the relationship a bit awkward. It's not a rejection so much as doing the right thing for them. There are some situations where an attraction cannot be avoided like for a school counselor if they have a student who is attracted to them. They can't refer them to someone else. So it has to be maintained appropriately. But those are younger kids who are malleable and easier to work with I think. 

Likewise, I also see a therapist and if I were attracted to her, I couldn't see her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the thing. I didn't know what an amiibo was. I didn't know it was an actual physical toy thing you buy in a box and then scan on your gamepad. I bought this game through wii u virtual so I didn't buy the game physically or anything. So I was unaware you had to physically buy something to complete the 'extra' challenges.

<TEXT> No I just saw people in game with these awesome outfits and stuff and wanted them for myself. So I though..maybe I have to beat single player. So I beat single player and got the sweet aerospray gold weapon which upped my scores in turf war considerably about by 6-700 a round I was getting about 1100 on avg now im getting around 1600 with that thing, and then the Gold Roller

But I want that head that DJ Octavio is wearing and I read online you have to do the amiibo challenges, so I looked how to actually do the challenges but it doesnt say anywhere online. It just says there are challenges so I was confused. 

So I have to buy a physical toy and scan the box.  </TEXT>

If you're the type of player that goes over to the enemy side during splatzone please stop. Every time you do we end up losing to the Japanese players and their god damn sniping machines.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I FUCKED UP REDDIT. I FUCKING FUCKED UP. THIS IS WHAT I GET. 

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

A spider came down on his web from my ceiling and ONTO MY FUCKING LAP PILLOW. He landed on the pillow and began crawling across it, I was frozen in place unable to fucking move by this unsettling and surprising move. 

Out of a rush of panic and delirium i used MY FUCKING HANDS to squish him into the pillow. But the pillow isn't a hard surface, there isn't enough surface friction there, I don't know if I killed him because I CANT FIND HIS GUTS OR CORPSE. 

And to make matters worse I think he is a spiderling babe, so THERES PROBABLY MILLIONS OF THEM PLOTTING REVENGE. 

I'm so fucked reddit. I gotta burn my apartment down. MY CAT IS NO FUCKING HELP. FAT CAT ASSHOLE. 

I'm gonna try and find him, but my carpet is brown and my shorts/ and recliner are both black. FUCK. I'll try and update as the situation progresses into the early morning. Not sleeping tonight. 

**UPDATE: Well reddit, I can't find anything. I can't find the spider's remains or his guts or his live body. Save yourself reddit. I'm a goner. I think maybe I will buy a hotel tonight. I'll bring my cat, as lazy and fat as he is, I don't want him to be killed. This is the end, I'm sure of it.**

Update: Still not found. Hard to sleep. Got a hotel with my cat the next two nights and set a bug bomb off in the apartment...

**TL;DR  can't find the spider i did or did not kill, may have to leave all my possessions and move...tonight**   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They were working not 20 minutes ago. When a video ended I went to start another one and VLC crashed immediately. I went to try the last video file that worked but it crashed too. I tried using my other video players but they all crash immediately.  HDC, VLC, Realplayer, itunes, they all crash when i start to play a video file- audio files they play fine. 

I do not know why it started doing that so suddenly. It happened yesterday too, but I ran a malwarebytes scan and got rid of some malware and then it started working again. However, I ran malware again and it found nothing today. So I am confused. 

I have windows 7, 64bit, 8GB Ram 

All my graphics card drivers are up to date. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the video players. Any suggestions?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> VLC Player crashes automatically when opening video file </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-05 20:03:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have Windows 7, 64 bit

8GB RAM

I have had VLC for a long time, it's fully updated and the newest version. I began using it a few hours ago to watch a television show .avi file and another was a .mkv file. It worked fine as it has always worked fine.
Then I decided to listen to some music. So I listened to an audio file on the VLC player. When I was finished I went back to the video file and VLC crashed. It kept crashing upon trying to open a video file. It still plays music files .mp3 but not mp4, .avi. or .mkv files. It just crashes immediately.
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling which did not work, as well as resetting all the preferences. Troubleshooted some stuff on youtube/google but couldn't find anything that was like this issue.

In addition, I tried installing older versions to no avail. I also ran a virus scan, but nothing changed.

EDIT: Fixed it. I ran Malwarebytes and it removed some malware and now VLC runs again. Weird. Keeping this thread up in case someone encounters same issues. I had originally run Avast Virus Scanner and it found nothing so I figured it was okay.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Kung Fury: A Review (Spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-31 03:24:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>   'I've got your permit right here!' And thus began the best movie ever filmed. Kung Fury, a short film, about a cop who becomes Kung Fury, master Kung-Fu martial artist, via lightning/cobra strike. 
He protects the city of Miami from crime with his super awesome one liners and impenetrable forces. This adventure he must hack time with the help of his friend Hackerman to rid the world of Hitler, who wants the pwoer of Kung Fury for himself. 
         
Written   directed by David Sandberg, it was originally a trailer turned into short film. Made with the help of an amazing kickstarting campaign what David Sandberg has accomplished here is nothing short of brilliance in animation   filmmaking. After my first viewing, I thought it would be better if it could be a feature length film. Then I realized, I could just watch the film three times in a row and it would fulfill that need. 

 This film has everything you could ever want from an over the top, cheesy one liner 80's flick. 

1. Laser-Raptors

2. Hitler, the villain

3. Triceracop- Half mancop/Half Triceratop

4. David Hasselhoff singing 80s style music 

5. Cheesy one-liners 

6. Arcade machines with lasers trying to kill people 

7. Thor 

8. Barbarianna   Katana, Viking Age warrior women with machine guns

9. The Nintendo Power Glove hacking time with 80s computers 'breaking' time. 

10. T-Rex Vs Golden Metal Eagle monster fight with small t-rex arms vs small eagle legs. 

11. Anime sequence with cobras as spirit animals.

12.  Amazing action sequence where Kung Fury takes on Hitler's minions. This scene is perhaps one of the greater achievements of the film. It reminded me of playing Mega Man   Sonic where the POV moves horizontally. Simply genius. 

13. Cheesy product placement. 

**14. And finally paying homage to Laser Unicorns with the beginning arcade game being laser unicorns and a laser unicorn seen in the anime sequence when Fury goes to 'heaven'.**



 Every so often a film comes along, once in a lifetime, where it makes you rethink your entire life. This is that film. The greatest film ever made.  I salute this film. And now will go watch it again. 

**Also, watch the film in 144P or the lowest setting on youtube if you can. It's better than HD. HD is good, but to get the full effect, go for the lowest setting in quality.** </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have an HP All in one. It is old I got it in 2011. I have used it to play two games in the past: Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot. It's always worked fine playing UO, never any overheating problems. I've never had any problems with Dark Age of Camelot until today. I went to re-download the game and play after haven't played for about a year...

When I go to patch the game, which takes some time to patch 3 GBs... my GPU gets up to around 80 degrees and the computer shuts off so I have to wait for it to cool down. I have a fan pointed at my computer to help, but it doesn't help so much. I don't have my computer connected to a TV or anything. 

What could have changed in the past year that my computer would start overheating playing a game I've played for years on this machine? What can I do to ensure it won't overheat without having to buy anything at this juncture? 

My drivers are all up to date. I have ATI Radeon HD 5570 </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-22 19:26:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>   I watched this movie again today. I figured it would be different than the last I watched it which was when I was 15/16. I liked it a lot then and I loved it even more now. 

  I understand the director has made really terrible films since this starting with The Village; however, Unbreakable is quite amazing. I enjoyed the acting from Samuel L Jackson. I think, besides a few other roles it may have been his best acting job. I liked the cinematography and the music. It gave each character a theme much like superhero films. For Bruce Willis, his character had cool colors always around him, greens   blues. While the supposed supervillain was immersed in purple. I liked that contrast. 

I think what I enjoyed most in the movie was this idea of understanding our place in this world. 

I liked watching it in contrast with the influx of all the comic book movies that are popular right now. This is so different from them, even more different than Nolan's Batman films. His Batman's films attempted a sense of more realism I think, but this film captures it ...differently, much more dramatic less action. 

What are some movies similar to this? I can't think of any. It's unique.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-18 08:37:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why couldn't they beam Spock/Khan back to the Enterprise while they are fighting? Chekov says it is become he can't get a lock because they are moving. But..in Star Trek (2009), he beams Kirk and Sulu back on board when they are falling without a parachute. So they were moving a lot faster/worse then, why can't he simply do the same this time when all they are doing is fighting?

Also...wasn't Kirk dead too long for them to save him. I mean, he was dead for what 30 minutes? That's...I don't understand this. So..Khan's blood can effectively raise the dead? Why don't they just harvest his blood? </TEXT>

I read the synopsis for 4..and ..humpback whales? It just seems kind of strange. So out of 4, 5, and 6 which one is seen as next best from 2? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A family walks into a talent agency.... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-10 23:43:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A family walks into a talent agency. It's a father, mother, son, daughter and dog. The father says to the talent agent, "We have a really amazing act. You should represent us."

The agent says, "Sorry, I don't represent family acts. They're a little too cute."

The mother says, "Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us."

The agent says, "OK. OK. I'll take a look."

The father pulls out a watermelon and shoves it in the daughters vagina. The daughter screams in pain from the giant fruit. Then the son takes off his shirt revealing a pink bra and starts fingering himself in the asshole. The mother takes off all of her clothes and starts to finger herself while the father feeds her x-lax pills. The father grabs the daughter and shoves her face right in the mothers butt hole that at that moment exploded with diarrhea all over her face and it filled up her mouth. The the daughter turned to the son and spat the diarrhea all over him. Then the father reaches in the girls vagina and pulls out the now stinky, cum covered watermelon and starts to hump it while the mother begins to shoot her explosive diarrhea in his direction. Then the son begins to rub his cock and cums all over the daughter. Then the father stops humping the watermelon and cums all over her. They continue to cum on her while the mother fills up a plastic kiddie pool with her crap and piss. They all jump in the human excrement and start to fuck each other. Now the pool is filled with cum and shit and piss. 

They jump out of the pool covered in cum and shit and piss and say "tada!".


For the longest time, the agent just sits in silence. Finally, he manages, "That's a hell of an act. What do you call it?"

And the father says, **"The Aristocrats!"**

<TEXT> I noticed this is a movie a lot of people enjoyed. Is there something I'm missing with this movie? It's seem really highly rated but when I watch it there's no endearing quality about it, it's just a cheesy humor, action flick with not so great montages of a kid training while we watch the villain plot. Is this like a homage or satire? 

What am I missing? I feel like there's a joke and I missed it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by telling my friend his behavior was unacceptable </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-03 03:26:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So about 6-7 months ago I told my best friend at the time that his behavior was unacceptable when he got drunk: Example: Overly aggressive, violent, angry, mean, physical, arrogant, and insulting when he gets drunk. One night was the icing on the cake for me, and I told him when he was sober how I felt and that I think he might have a problem. Irregardless if he believes that he does, I didn't want to be around him when he drinks anymore because he treats people badly. 

In perfect him fashion, he said he disagrees with everything I said and never wants to talk to me about it again. 

Systematically the few months after that all of my friends stopped talking to me and asking me to hang out. Now i have no friends where I live and it makes me wonder if I had just gone along with it and put up with it maybe I will still have friends. 

None of them have spoken to me at all in the past 4 months.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened many many years ago when I was in 5th grade but I was reminded of it today when I got a hard on. 

I used to think when I was younger that us men got boners because it meant we had to pee and the stiffy meant the penis was full of urine. 

So one day in class during silent reading time, I had an erection and stood up and walked to my teacher and asked if I may go to the bathroom. I was standing there with my pre-pubescent dick with a pitched tent and my teacher gave me the strangest look. I didn't think anything of it, I thought this was normal and all boys walked around like this when having to drain the snake. 

I went and finished my business and my member was flaccid again so I went back in the room and everyone was still looking at me. Later at recess people kept calling me Masturbating Matt and that set the tone for the rest of elementary school and middle school for me until I went to a high school where no one knew me. 

tl;dr thought my shaft getting rigor mortis meant it was time to go to the bathroom.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Missing person somewhere in Texas last seen:

My friend Thomas W. has been missing for over a week. He lives in Columbus Ohio and his last known whereabouts were somewhere in Texas where he was doing a job of some sort. He does not do drugs so this is very out of his character. He is also a father and needs to be found. If you know anything at all please PM me for facebook info.

Or if you know how to check hospitals or some type of database. He's never been in trouble or anything, but has been missing and his family is concerned.

<TEXT> I wanted to take the time to thank Reddit and people on here for coming together to help the people in Nepal this past few days. We created /r/NepalEarthquake   /r/LangtangRelief both awesome subreddits. Watching it unfold has been extremely motivating, seeing people work together tirelessly. 

We got all this info from people in Nepal, someone who is even talking to people in Langtang via SAT phone to see what they need food wise. News articles, local contact, helping one another find lost ones or missing ones with a missing/found google doc database. 

I find it fascinating   motivating how beautifully the internet can be used to resource and connect people so quickly. 

The /r/NepalEarthquake subreddit is really awesome seeing how fast people have compiled a compendium of everything so quickly- with the sole purpose of helping one another. 


It's fascinating to see the results of what happens when people work as a part of a global team.

Thanks for listening to my ramble. I just wanted to say thank you reddit. You're awesome. 

TL;DR - Motivated by Redditors working together to help Nepal Earthquake victims. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's rare. 

**bagpipper-onnen (OP)**: MacFarlane has to be bangin Amanda Seyfriend, he's casting her in everything he does. 

**AckleyKid1990**: Yeah wow he's cast her in two whole movies. That's insane. If that's how it works, Leo Dicaprio and Scorcese must be married with three kids, a poodle, a couple of Prius' and a beach house in Lake Geneva by now.


**theshape26**:Yep, DiCaprio and Scorsese are together. It's a long story. Now, it's never been publicly revealed but from 1973 to 1995, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro were an item. Unfortunately, Scorsese caught De Niro in bed with Joe Pesci and they broke up. Scorsese stopped casting De Niro   Joe Pesci's career pretty much died. 

Then in 2001, Scorsese ran into DiCaprio at a party and they started talking. They had met in 1993 when Leo was still a teen, at the premiere of This Boy's Life. They were introduced by... Robert De Niro! 

By the way, for those wondering, De Niro and Pesci broke up in 2006 and in 2011, De Niro started an affair with Bradley Cooper. They also knew each other from before when they briefly talked, at The Actor's Studio when De Niro was a guest in 1998.

<TITLE> Twin Peaks </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-19 16:12:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have just about finished season one of Twin Peaks. A couple things I would like to ask: 

Among fans of Twin Peaks, is there a running joke about how many times Agent Cooper drinks coffee, or how excited he is every episode when he gets an amazing cup of coffee, minus fish in the one sip he had. 

I can't tell if some of it is bad acting or if it is done purposely, there are some really hilarious lines. I really feel bad for the girl's dad, but ...damn if it wasn't hilarious watching him try to dance to those swing/big band songs that kept coming on. Should I be laughing at that? lol

I have never seen any David Lynch before, so I am new to his creations and style of directing. 

I was told to watch the movie after I am finished with season 2, is this correct? It looks like a prequel though, is it worth watching?



EDIT: Just finished Episode 8 with the cliffhanger of an ending. Wow. Season 1 was marvelous if for nothing else than that wonderful soundtrack of glory. Running theme of the first season: Almost every female relationship the female is being abused somehow. 

I knew I recognized James from somewhere, he was also in A Few Good Men.  </TEXT>

Just watched the first episode of Twin Peaks for the first time, why is this guy (on the right) randomly doing a strange wormy jig off camera in the background? It's so random...made me laugh out loud. Is this show full of random quirks like this?

 I was originally recommended to watch this show because I love the X-Files, I recognize the music will be a bit weird because this came out 25 years ago, but it seems to be rich full of randomness that just makes me giggle and I love it.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was in my car driving home from Easter Dinner with my mum and a large white spider started crawling across my windshield. I was almost home so I pulled over and put my emergency lights on. 


After this I tried to kill him with my hands but he foiled my attempts at squashing with my clumsy hands and he landed on the passenger side dashboard. I then got a bunch of paper I had laying around in my passenger sit and rolled it up to swat him. 


For whatever reason he survived it and fell on my passenger seat then he scurried away onto the passenger side ground among all the trash I had laying there. 

The worst possible outcome happened. I lost sight of him. He disappeared. I drove home with my car lights on keeping a watchful eye on that side of the car. Then I got home..not sure if I'll ever drive that car again


EDIT: Spider dead. Went down to my car to try and retrieve my cellphone this morning and I saw him crouched against the weather stripping on the driver's side window on the inside. I rolled my window down and he started crawling out on the outside door frame. I threw water on him. He fell to the ground. I stepped on him. I can drive my car now.  </TEXT>

She got a school visa to come to school here. She graduated from undergrad, then she got her graduate degree as well. She is currently working at a job, but they will not help her stay by saying they absolutely need her or whatever on her immigration forms for a visa. She has an immigration firm that is helping her with the massive application process but she is going to have to move away in 4-5 months and be deported if she does not figure out another way.


They could get married, theyve been dating for a while, but they don't want to do that because it wouldn't be "sincere." I mean they do love each other, but not ready for marriage and yet neither one wants her to go. She wants to stay, he wants her to stay.


I want to be able to help because I hate seeing him sad. I know her place of employment had to fill out a certain section of her application and they refused to which I guess was the only way she could stay?
Any advice?

<TITLE> When I was ten years old, my friend's family had a house rule called cuddle time.... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted this as a comment on Ask Reddit on a question about what is the strangest house rule you have come across in your life. This is mine. Someone suggested I put it in /r/creepy and while I am not sure if it is up to part with some of the other posts I have seen here and I have no pictures...here is Cuddle time. 

When I was ten years old, my friend's family had something called cuddle time. When cuddle time started, my friend, his parents, his autistic brother, and his other younger brother would get into bed naked and cuddle. I'm not joking. Luckily, I didn't have to and I left the house and haven't spoken with him since. Literally I walked out the door and walked to a payphone and called my mom. Creepiest shit I ever witnessed. It irks me to this day.

I mean...the way it started out was just bizarre. Anyone ever seen Clerks 2? The way Randall looks at Elias when he tells the story of pillow pants? That's how I looked at my friend and his family when he told me it was "cuddle time" 

He started taking his clothes off in front of me, like it wasn't a big deal and it was completely normal and I should join them. In their defense, they said I didn't have to. They said it's just something they do for family unity or bonding or some shit. I dunno. I got the fuck out.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by eating a piece of chocolate </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-09 08:21:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Around 6PM today I ate a piece of chocolate. About five minutes later I realized I had to go poop. I went to go poop and it was one of the worst experiences I have had pooping in a long time. I was in there for two hours. 

It felt like having a double edged sword swimming around im my stomach constantly laughing at my plight. The laughing would signify the bubble/stomach groans I often felt in the middle, like my stomach was a goblet of fire. 

To make matters worse I was reading that reddit post that was on the front page a day or so ago asking the question of whether or not a fart can overtake a poop or vice versa in the intestine. I pondered this questions while pooping on my own as I would poop then bubble out some farts, then poop. 

I stood up and was exhausted to the point to where I couldn't stand. I felt 'drunk.' So I laid down. 

Five minutes later I realized I wasnt through pooping. The shear amount of force I put into each strain made me feel like I was just going to shit my colon out. I got through round two seemingly quicker, only about thirty minutes. 

I sat on my bed again. Then realized I still wasn't finished. This time it was mostly urine being forced out but yet a bubble in my stomach caused an avalanche of poop and now red blood to come out. Round three was surely the end? Nope. 

It went on like this for about eight rounds. I went and sat in my chair and watched the movie 42. After it was finished round nine started. 

I've decided not to ever eat again. Obviously, yes, I have Crohn's Disease but this is probably the worst day I've ever had. The most pain. 

I often wonder what would have happened if I didn't eat that piece of chocolate. Maybe my poops would have been spread out over time and not been as painful. I have no idea.

<TEXT> My name is Sean. Pronounced Shawn. It rhymes with Yawn. Not Seen.

 I drove to pickup my chinese food order which I ordered online from my apartment. It's been really snowy lately so it was a bit of a hassle driving there but I finally arrived. 

Hello, pick up?

yeah

name?

Sean

uhhhh, last name?

*******

internet order?

yeah, am I early or something?

oh, Seen.

what?

your name Seen

no, my name Sean

says Seen on ticket

says Sean on ticket

*takes my credit card*

sure its not Seen?

yeah pretty sure

why it spelled like that

ask my parents

(Asian woman in background saying something, probably talking shit)
*little boy laughs and stares at me*

thanks?

ok bye

bye

-end-

I took my food and went out into my car and drove home, which is only a 5-10 minute drive. I realized they forgot my chicken fried rice, so I drove back. When I got there it was very busy in the back behind the counter like lots of people there. The same kid came up to the counter and said,

 "Oh..Seen again"

"No..Sean...again, you forgot chicken fried rice in bag" 

*I handed him my receipt* 

*He looked at everyone in the back which was about 4-6 people and said "we forgot seen rice" and everyone started laughing.*

They handed me some rice and I left, somehow feeling ashamed because I was born with the spelling of my name Sean. A bunch of Chinese food employees at the China Wok made fun of me for it and had a nice laugh over it.
