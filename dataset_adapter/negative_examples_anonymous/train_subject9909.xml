<TITLE> Are there any Youtube channels or users who recut trailers for popular movies to remove spoilers? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I stopped watching the new Bond trailer halfway through. Usually, I don't care, but it seemed like overkill showing me every action scene and important female line in the movie. [When I heard](#s "He's protecting someone and then saw the blonde woman,") it just *hit me* and I decided that was too much info for how sold on the movie I already was.

Does anyone recut trailers to save movies from their marketers? Do they, maybe, have a low ^/medium ^^/high content threshold for people who want different amounts of spoilage?

One could argue Bond movies have always given away a lot, but that doesn't mean they have to now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> random list of things I hope to do next time I look at a property: 

* Bring a 100 ft tape and mark out any specimen trees (you want) or physical obstacles to building.

* Figure out where the sun will rise and set, and how high above the level horizon it is (mountains or trees on adjacent property).

* Note which way the wind blows, and look for signs it might not always blow that way.

* If you want to to mob grazing (check out Joel Salatin and Allan Savory) you could even leave trees in strategically to create attachment points for mobile fencing.

* You probably already checked the soil map, but taking a look at dirt won't hurt.

* Double check water sources and rights.

* You in a flood plain?

* Inquire with neighbors as to power outages and nuisances. </TEXT>

<TITLE> "What it Takes to Make a Decent Living Raising Ethical Meat" If you care to study the control of externalities in food industry. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 16:38:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The [article](http://civileats.com/2015/07/13/what-it-takes-to-make-a-decent-living-raising-ethical-meat/) is short enough, but notice there are two books.

1. *[Farms with a Future](http://www.amazon.com/Farms-Future-Creating-Sustainable-Business/dp/1603584382)* was written first and is apparently a series of interviews and observations.

2. *[The New Livestock Farmer: The Business of Raising and Selling Ethical Meat](http://www.chelseagreen.com/the-new-livestock-farmer)* seems to me to have more appeal for theoretical study, since it is a derivative work which makes a point to address how things should be done, nothow others are doing them.

When we discuss externalities in food production, we can talk about the effects on resources, animals, food products, consumers, and the competitive market. I hope to be able to find someone who can communicate clearly the weight I place on social matters as externalities, or develop that message myself. It is one thing to remark on industrial animal farms as inefficient, but another to say when they replace more local food production it has more human detractions. The second message may win us more friends, allies, and converts.

(edit: both books are available on Amazon. I think there is a 25% discount when you sign up for the publisher's mailing list when bought through the Chelsea Green site.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Hampton Mansion, north of Baltimore, was the largest residence in America when finished in 1790. The empire-like holdings the Ridgley family had control over dipped heavily into early industries such as ironworks, mills, quarries, and armories which eventually supplied much of the cannon ordered by the Continental Congress for the revolution.

I would say you are correct. The multiple large cities in the area greatly improved the market for inorganic materials and processing services which have a faster rate of return than farming.

It would be interesting to see if there was a difference in marketing for the local tobacco versus the more southern tobacco. I think the southern product was exported overseas, while urban Marylanders would enjoy the bounty of their neighbors. Marketing overseas includes great risk and overhead, meanwhile the Ridgleys could sell to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Wilmington, and settlers headed west. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. These new mental health facilities and associations may not all be good, and some go bad over time. This isn't a reform looking backward, but forward.

2, 3. It depends how successful any movement is, whether or not bureaucracies will fall.

4. I don't think I see any direct comment through that article's content.

One of the problems with mental health is that in the past we have not had many cases of people being "cured." The terrible situation where once a person falls into a problem, they never crawl out. This is as costly as a lifetime sentence in prison.

Today we have the benefit of improving nutrition and finally have real empathic counseling. Not every patient has a chance of full recovery, but many cases of depression and anxiety can be relaxed by giving people the strength to return to normal life and the lessons to remain with us. We are leaving behind the inhumane and despicable "treatments" of old.

One of the "trusting" aspects of saying *if one political faction makes changes as they see fit, what will happen* is that you have to trust the economy will get better. We all think our way will make it better, so I would extend the same hypothetical to any other suggestion. When an economy gets better, people have more time for personal projects and family, a greater possibility of gaining capital, and less-tight budgets. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the libertarian solution to our mental health crisis?

1. Tort reform to repair us to a "loser pays" system. This enables little guys who have a definite winning case, but no money, to take on corporations with legions of lawyers.

2. FDA told to let all medications meeting basic, fast, approval onto the market. Doctors and consumers should be responsible for using healthy treatments and [private associations can be formed to guarantee product quality.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvxT7fryE3Q) This enables products excluded by the cost of FDA approval to come to market and allows new products to take on old ones without lobbyists preventing the FDA from approving.

3. The VA would stop automatic prescription of psychotropic medication. Our vets need real, personal, mental health guidance. People can be counseled out of darkness, it isn't a chemical imbalance. [There is no evidence of a chemical imbalance causing emotional or mental changes in a way like we hear from pharmaceutical companies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARZ2Wv2BoFs) (By the way that ain't some internet quack)

4. (Presuming a libertarian government is making more decisions and cutting government spending) Reduced taxes and maybe even a restored currency would enable more charitable giving and investment in philanthropic ventures. Families living in fear of siblings or children would have more options for where to send their troubled relatives for help.

This is off the top of my head. I wonder if #2 would help stop family physicians from being barraged with commissions from pharma companies to prescribe quotas of psychotropic drugs. Doctors would also be responsible for commending and recommending patients to mental health facilities. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   figuring that settles the issue

You'll have to point out where I said that, or inferred it. I gave you some things to watch. That doesn't mean I considered it the end-all be-all. Obviously, since we are still discussing it.

 The dichotomy between Keynesian and Austrian capital models come to mind very quickly.

Those are different understandings of a single reality. There are similarities and differences in the understandings and since we are not omniscient, neither one can be proven - though parts can be disproven (As Keynesianism/ use of econometrics has been on a philosophical basis by Austrian Econmists).

 unique moral priority to their culture

I find that humanity has a single morality. Different cultures have different traditional responses to their environments which color morality (espiecially in the absence of Christianity).

 Capitalism fitted the people with a yoke akin to slavery.

As I said, G.K.C. created his own definition of good, pure capitalism (distributism) and relegated the term "capitalism" to crony capitalism in his work. Businesses profiting by use of the force of the state to oppress and repress workers and competition being akin to a yoke of slavery? That I agree with and think he did too - but that is referring to a political mess not a system or quality of economics.

I am a hopeful anarcho-capitalist, though I realize that future is troubled and dim at present. I hold a county-level party position in the Republican party and a leadership position in both a state-level and county-level groups partial to Ron Paul, though nonpartisan.

I am not nice on the internet. Don't know why. Maybe I'm too nice in person. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But I still find it interesting that the Nazi's base of power was in Munich and Bavaria (largely Catholic), but that the locals there still did not support them in large numbers

If the NAZI party tried to base somewhere more mild to their views, rabid supporters like one finds in a minority would not be present. Rather, there would be the diffident reactions one expects from people who agree but are not surrounded by people holding ideas they dislike enough to value activism over working or family. In Bavaria, Hitler probably found people who despised the local norms and made sure to turn up at every event. Supporters from other parts of the nation who were strong enough lent what they could. Disrupting the norm gave them national acclaim.

I am hypothesizing, not dictating from research. </TEXT>

 Obviously don't leave raw meat in warm water for hours, but just to defrost? Its fine.

These two are tied together. If meat is left in the bacterial growth range of temperatures too long and then cooked, it isn't the bacteria you have to worry about - but the toxins they leave behind. If defrosted horribly incorrectly, a meat can still be unsafe when cooked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What would you call an appeal to authority? Everything I have posted is not backed by citations because these people wrote books - which you can buy or find in libraries if you want the knowledge.

There is no such thing as "an expression of capitalism." Capitalism is not political. Capitalism is the use of savings and trade. Chesterton did accept this definition - though he wrapped it in much discourse - but then he liked to be the person making the definitions rather than using someone else's. His main problem with economics was how few people had capital instead and how many had wages because they had no capital. Distributism solved that voluntarily. But that is the thing - a true free market is created by and regulated by voluntary action. Chesterton made Distributism to give free market capitalism a new name, to scoot out from the influence of governments.

"We are so horribly unjust..." Who is horribly unjust? The small business owner who has to choose how to split up 60 hrs of work per week between two employees? The daycare owner who has to comply with mandated regulations and pay legal insurance because tort is unreformed? Can we even *really* blame the corporations for lobbying the governemnt to control and capture our legislatures and regulations, respectively? A corporation is a protected class of private organization only possible thorugh governemnt law and corporations only want to lobby because the government has power over their sectors and industries... so maybe the solution is to remove power from the government at various levels and return a large degree of subsidiarity to our nation?

So that last comment wasn't so much ad hominem as particularly broad. You are making nonsense statements and need more grounding in the background of the development these ideas underwent from different sources than you are used to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [ ...historians with an ideological axe to grind against the market usually ignore an authoritative 1906 report of the Department of Agricultures Bureau of Animal Husbandry. Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclairs allegations, some of which they labeled as willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact, atrocious exaggeration, and not at all characteristic. ](http://fee.org/freeman/detail/29-upton-sinclairs-the-jungle-proved-regulation-was-required)

Same article -

 According to the popular myth, there were no government inspectors before Congress acted in response to The Jungle, and the greedy meat packers fought federal inspection all the way. The truth is that not only did government inspection exist, but meat packers themselves supported it and were in the forefront of the effort to extend it so as to ensnare their smaller, unregulated competitors.

Same article -

 In the end, Americans got a new federal meat inspection law, the big packers got the taxpayers to pick up the entire $3 million price tag for its implementation, as well as new regulations on the competition, and another myth entered the annals of anti-market dogma.

Same article -

 To his credit, Sinclair actually opposed the law because he saw it for what it really wasa boon for the big meat packers.

Enjoy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I respect that opinion and think it applies to so many things in American life, but who is getting the money and how?

1. We know how we got here and who did it. It may have been a conspiracy to snag McGovern to the anti-fat side, but that seems about it. Corporations got in bed with narcissistic scientists, which gave them sway over legislators.

2. The "broken window fallacy" describes how causing an expense in one place does not simply create profit in another. If you break the baker's window, the glazier and judge get a payday but the miller and shoemaker go without. Although we live in a nation whose economic policy has been crafted by people who do not understand this phenomena at all, and sometimes applaud when nature breaks windows, I personally would not lay the blame for a bloated sector on outright government action. Rather, it is known that pharmaceutical and agricultural corporations lobby to preserve the status-quo.

IMO it isn't about keeping people working but keeping people sick. People working is a result of people being sick. A bad economist would say that keeping people working is the goal (to increase economic action) but a good economist would realize that the added expense of healthcare slows the economy and wastes people's money, forcing them to support the added expense while making them less able to do the basic productive acts at all levels of industry.

There is always going to be a fuzzy line between required expenses, subjectively desired expenses, and expenses mistakenly required. All these expenses mistakenly required by government advising an improper  diet are funds siphoned off and straight up handed to various industries: Agriculture, healthcare, diet foods, and exercise. It doesn't matter if someone has a job now because of the misallocation, they would have had a better one if the mistake had never been made. We all kinda had other plans for that money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got interested in all this from listening to a three-hour lecture by Mark Shepard. He specifically embraces capitalism to the extent it is the way to do business.

So here is something interesting. There is another movement: New Urbanism. But if you ask some of the more conservative people they will take the buzz word and scream AGENDA 21! AGENDA 21! So that leaves Andres Duany out of the picture. Andres, along with his wife and some others started it right out of college. But their exposure is limited. This engineer in the midwest, Chuck Marohn, gets fed up with creating bad environments and finally sees their stuff outside the left/right spectrum. He heads a group called Strong Towns. Together - and they are well known to each other - one or the other can get into any town or city in the US.

*They are both promoting the same thing.* Serving people, restoring economic rationality.

It is the same, everywhere. Even with the Papacy! Back and forth. Distributism! But property rights are central! Social Justice! But remember that social doesn't mean government. The earth has to be preserved... We want something and we all think we know how to get it... but we swim in anarchy. That is the reality. Society, markets, and the individual all interact but have different rules on the inside.

Permaculture is kinda like a ruleset for anarchy in some ways. Extremely interesting.

<TEXT> I expect in Sweden there is a lot of literature on what to do and how to do it, along with local representatives who can help you get started. Still, I might suggest frequenting farmers markets without a CSA for a year until you get your feet under you. Sell what you end up with until you can predict what you will have.

But I know goats, not fields, so take that for as much weight as you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a different/concordant theory. I have a coconut allergy and get a rash that looks like the keto rash if I ingest coconut protein. I think people who go keto are trying new protein sources and experience allergic reactions to some. Some people get over the allergy, because oral ingestion will sometimes do that, and not have the problem again.

Since there is no scientific studies yet, we don't know. Both make sense to me because adipose tissue stores a lot more than fat and releasing it fast can't be easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess I'm trying to get away from "whose fault is it?"

People experience incentivized and naturally attractive options; also disincentivized and naturally poor options. I think we are in a situation where different forces have disincentivized the general population from both simply choosing to eat healthier and doing the research to find out what they think might be very healthy eating.

The government may be some of those forces (and the federal overreach enables that), but there are cascading forces off of that - and even more important - there are forces which influenced government in the first place.

Government is a tool for lobbyists. I blame capture on narcisistic scientists and irresponsible corporations. Like take a look at the McGovern report. The government got behind fringe ideas even though strong opposition was there from the scientific community. There is nothing more dangerous than a narcisistic scientist with an idea that a major industry can use to control mass populations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other luminaries include Allan Savory and Mark Shepard. I've seen that Bill Mollison understood most of what these men practice now and Geoff Lawton helps spread news about and teach people.

We can feed the world, but it will mean making farms more labor-intensive. That isn't a bad thing, because done correctly it is healthy and fulfilling work, but people are used to seeing robotic harvesters raoming across the plains scooping up grains. Raising a head of cattle will take much less land and water and almost only the land the herd grazes on will be included in the process. No more taking into consideration the roads between the grains in Iowa and the industrial ranches in Colorado or the water rights in Nevada for the farm in California. With more people on the land those dying midwest towns will liven up, increasing opportunity and prosperity. The deserts of the Southwest can be restored through management by slowing down the water that currently flash-floods away.

How much more valuable would the land we currently till for corn be if it didn't take so many material inputs? How much more affordable would meat and whole food be if it was produced by many more people rather than a few strings of corporate farms? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Progressive government programs are generally an attempt at equal outcomes. Of course, how can a government manage an economy down to the individual? It cannot; so some idiot thought it would be just fine to try and make people equal by dividing them by demographics. Gender, age, wealth, ethnicity. To do so is institutionalizing discrimination and directly impinges free opportunity.

"But!" They will say, "The ---- people have more of these jobs than the ---- people. That isn't fair!"

Why are they acting like those people are different? To get votes from one or the other. Or out of an incorrect sense of justice which relies on discriminating against successful people by seeing their succsess as dependent on institutionalized force... but then why use more institutionalized force instead of just removing what those people were supposedly using? It is like gaining the One Ring and thinking you can control it, when it will really just enslave you.

<TEXT> Being from Senegal *in particular* does not mean anything to his argument. The fact that health inspectors were unaware of why the code was the way it was and maybe that it should be changed was important. They also, like everyone else, did not understand or care how hard it was to do business and what businesses contributed to the community. Both because they were not part of the community and because they were not culturally assimilated. The majority of these immigrants will one day look back and think they might have been too hard on many places they went to.

The other people had a different problem. Straight anti-business attitudes are from stupidity and misplaced elitism. These jerks are masters of the social bubble and will clip their incoming information so that they stay willfully ignorant of the problems they are causing unless an event pops the bubble... and then its even money between them coming around to more conservative attitudes or going full commie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Western European culture has historically toed this line in many ways which evolved into crossing the line. Once people were tempted to defeat the spirit of chastity in each practice it eventually became the norm and progressed from there, again.

Germanic cultures have used a board placed between two young adults sleeping in the same bed to test for marital compatibility. Sometimes there was even a chaperone involved, sitting there in the bedroom.

Allowing young people to sleep together eventually became turning a blind eye to young men "coming through the window" (literally scaling the house and sleeping overnight in the young lady's bedroom) on their own daughters. I've heard it said that coming through the window was a practice which came from times when couples were betrothed but financially or politically unable to marry.

Chaperoning seems to be the most stable resolution to ameliorating temptation when dating. Never leave yourself alone with someone if there is a chance you could get really physical. That will only leave you wanting more. Been there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sinarnu yelled at his ox-drivers around the heavy cart. "You sacks of vinegar!" Throwing his unencumbered hand in the air, he proceeded to point towards the correct dock. "My ships are at berth on the northern wharf! You waste my time and I'll make sure your masters flog you bloody!"

Standing to the side as the cart was more swiftly guided in the correct direction, Sinarnu hefted the box of metal under his arm. It was the most important piece and he didn't trust swine of men with it. It was a shame he had to endure these Bedu slaves - with their lowly foremen not much better. Taking a pace behind his most precious cargo, he tried to remember his own place as a well-connected merchant. He paid no mind to his personal slaves and entourage, which wafted the air near him with slightly scented palms and carried his necessary documents, impressed in kiln-dried clay.

As the cart wiled it's way through the dusty but cobbled streets to the edge of the wharfs, he spied Zannan coming down a sidestreet. A worthy merchant, he was no doubt coming to see what Sinarnu was taking to sea. The boy, Idadda, was also coming. He was coming to the age of twelve and six, fully grown and already accomplished. Their entourage and slaves combined were greater than his own, so Sinarnu pretended not to notice them approaching and hurried past the groaning, burlap covered cart to his waiting fleet. The cobble ended and slaves hurried even past the rushing merchant to identify mud and guide him around it.

The fishermen's fleet of the Aynen Row bordered Sinarnu's fleet and his slaves also took the duty of mustering a path through the men and women carrying baskets dripping brine and refuse on the dirt which sloped into the harbor of Ugarit. One woman, a transplanted Minoan who was customarily bare-breasted dropped her basket behind Sinarnu as he passed - causing his scribes and attendents to prance about, avoiding the catch sliding underfoot. Sinarnu noted the impression that might appear to Zannan, that hoity Hittite. He thought of a dismissive comment - just in case.

With his entourage picking themselves up behind the master - who looked very displeased - Captain Burnu tugged his oiled and curled goatee for luck and decided against smiling as the master came to the decking of the wharves. "We'll load the cargo immidiately."

Sinarnu stepped up, level with his dutiful employee, and sternly looked at him in a class-bridging evocation of contempt for his situation. "No, you'll have to wait until I entertain some friends..." Burnu looked to see Zannan and his son round the corner of another street and turn to walk up to them. There were a few minutes and he could see the oxen making good time through the moderate crowd and spilled fish (the Minoan woman still scrambling to gather the remaining, untrampled, fish). "We might be able to - " A wave of Sinarnu's free hand brought closure. "I have said." The key piece was handed over to Burnu, and Sinarnu confided: "Stow this now and act as if you have nothing to hide."

Burnu grabbed the metal and took it in stride. The master has his obligations, it would seem.

Sinarnu turned toward his approaching cart and kept the corner of his eye on the Hittite merchant. He also looked at the sky, seeing it was clear and blue with a weak and low sun for the late month. Comfortable and bright. The perfect atmosphere for gloating.

The behemoth load stopped at the deck's end, and Sinarnu clapped his hands for the foremen to take orders. Six swarthy Ugarits ambled off the cart and from the mass of livestock and resting slaves. "We are to beach the craft and lift the device by passing poles. Dispatch the beasts and assemble for the task!"

Now Zannan was upon the scene. Sinarnu was now among his strong and tanned sailors, who did odd jobs at the foot of the decking and carried things past - to and from the four ships. The Hittite was now evenly matched, at least in appearence of power. The best power - power over men.

"So you have a cargo, friend Sinarnu!" Zannan said in his brutal northern accent.

"I have a great cargo, friend Zannan. Welcome friend Idadda. You appear strong and fine. See my ships and men."

"Thank you friend Sinarnu, you do me honor. I have seen your ships and men and the wares you attempt to carry. We are all truly blessed in prosperity."

"The west does not see prosperity, though." Sinarnu added.

This puzzled the two Hittites slightly. Zannan asked, "How far west?"

"The blight was not yet upon Crete ere I last did hear."

Idadda replied "We are glad to know. The north is bitter but for the love of the Nile." Zannan nodded in agreement.

Frowning his own agreement to that statement, Sinarnu then smiled and raised a hand in a gesture of changing from news and pleasantries to the matters at hand. The air was open for Zannan to fill it.

"Please, I desire greatly to see what you have. I will give you a pair of tin ox-hides to know it."

Sinarnu chuckled, his tidy clothes concealing a jiggling belly. "Do so and I will show you. You will pay more to be told more."

"Done!" Zannan's eyes betrayed his sense of the importance he placed on new and dashing things. From knots and jointings to dances and spices - he was known for being a glut of information. The desire served him well in practical matters, but fed his soul even more. A scribe of his dashed across to organize the transaction.

A clap from the master and the eavesdropping foremen cut tethers on one side of the burlap cover, slaves pulling it to the ground. A shining contraption stood five feet tall off the bed of the cart. It was framed plainly but full of lines, plates, and spurs.

Zannan stood transfixed, a hand toussling his oiled locks. "You have a maze."

Idadda started to walk around the behemoth of oiled bronze and rubbed wood. "But not for amusement!" he politely called back to his father.

"A man of Babylon's great work." Sinarnu showed his open palm to Zannan. "Will you know what it works?"

"Yes, yes!" Called Idadda, clearly as enticed as his father. He was poking his nose up to the plates and sliding catches of the large machine, respectfully not touching but trying to absorb the complexity.

Zannan furrowed his brow with the upcoming wager for haggling information's price. Staring hard at the sea merchant above him on the decking, he shouted: "Two more tin ox-hides!"

"Done!" Sinarnu called out. Another scribe dashed about to manage the transfer. Sinarnu descended graciously, smiling at his needy competitor. Inside, he was armor-clad in knowing the knowledge would be of little use for the Hittite. Such a man simply did not have the conections, yet, to manage such an event. Strolling together, they circled the cart as the slaves and foremen stood back. "You see this outside of plates and beams, it carries the toothed plates inside. It makes sure the axles - like on wagons - do not move. This is a very special construction unlike we have seen before. I tell you the creator is a magician for what he makes metals do."

Idadda waited for them at the rear of the cart, having calmed down. "Father, there is a trough here for something."

Sinarnu waved a hand in an offer to have Zannan look closer. The Hittite ascended the cart wheel and looked deep into the... machine. "Tell me what goes in here, friend."

"The creature of purple dye." Zannan's eyes grew larger than his son's had. "And out comes the dye."

"I am afraid I have underpaid you... for this information." Zannan tried his most carefully to say as he eased himself to the ground. The dye of royals was immensely treasured. He did not want to be in debt to anyone - even an honorable Ugarit such as Sinarnu. "Please, let me - "

"You are in no need, friend." Sinarnu pretended to look ashamed in politeness. "I have concealed important information about the machine. It is not for sale but I can repeat that the man who built this is a magician." Sinarnu ushered his merchant colleagues away from the polished monstrosity. "Everything I have said is true and all you have seen is true. It is from the east and it is going to the west. It takes in the shellfish and dispenses the dye." He turned and pointed to the batch of his entourage responsible for refreshments and they readied a modestly transportable collection of foods and drinks.

Zannan watched the slaves cover the device back up in preparation for a sea voyage. "I hope to see one in motion."

Sinarnu thought of the metal box he had carried for miles from the trade roads outside Ugarit in confidence. He had opened it in the security of his own home - in the cellar. His cousin who made the journey said it was not magic but skill though some would not differentiate. The bronze spring inside was easily recognizeable as a work of immense value. Sinarnu did not know how it made the machine work. He knew more force was needed for operation, but it was still very alive in his hands as he regarded the power such a thing was capable of. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  peoples taxes (majority anyways) are paid through their employer. 

Exemptions can be requested... it would probably be rescinded after the first offense. That is why it would have to be coordinated. The government is made to act like it owns our money and lets us keep some. Overloading the system to the point where it will only operate if terribly simplified might be an avenue to correction.

The government is staffed by people and tied together by perception. One perception that keeps it aflaot is the perception that enforcers are doing the right thing (this is important within the ranks of enforcers and in the general citizenry, of course). Since this is usually incorrect at some level, administrators have two options to keep the perception alive. They can either walk back the control or lash out and justify actions later.

With the ranch, the government had made a mistake *somewhere,* so they had to stop the hardball. If I remember correctly, it was with not enforcing the arrangement more formally and immediately. Maybe it flew under the radar for a while before someone noticed - I don't recall. Nobody thinks FBI and LMB agents dieing over scrubland will solve anything. </TEXT>

The legal reasons for having a record of marriage is to protect each spouse and any children without any taxes to be accounted for. Churches have long provided this service, which these days provides a great deal of geneological assistance. </TEXT>

You cannot expect stable, reasonable, people to trust a system will be better without proof of the final result. Especially when the change will be complete and total.

You are saying that you can't even concieve of success if less than the entire world is transformed. Are you sure? Maybe a region or a medium sized country? (This is in the context of the reddit post, where there would hypothetically be no armed opposition, nor ideological opposition) Can you concieve of there being a placenta-like interface at the theoretical place where the two meet? Inside the geographical area, socialism with no property rights. Outside, anarchy with other socialist groups.

I think I know what you should say, though I'll tell you if you reply so I don't spoil it.

It sounds like you saying socialism has no way to protect from anti-social elements, or are you conceding that socialism is not good enough to prove itself in the face of no opposition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see them, too. The place I work is doing civil for some redevelopment. There are big problems in Balt with underground utilities and the concept of re-using existing row home frontage.

The Balt city government did a massive public works project a few decades ago and "upgraded" the city water mains. That is in scare quotes because they used reinforced concrete for pressurized mains. At any given time, there is a major road closure because the pipe has popped. Any redevelopment needs to address this and that means it only makes financial sense to do work an entire block at a time.

When people drive through the empty parts of the city, they see the backs of buildings burnt out and the fronts mostly fine but boarded up. Many of these shells could be refilled with a home. It is a waste of time, though, because of the structure of the blocks. First, there is very little hope for anyone to use these mass-produced buildings for small business. The lot size and access are not there. Second, you would have to get the zoning changed and to do that you would have to get grassroots support. While you are doing that you might as well get an entire new government elected. I've been in those offices and met those people. Plenty are capable and confident, but the private development process is not lean by and stretch or chew. Third, the streets are too wide. Three to four lanes of sometimes considerable car traffic will kill any neighborhood. The frontage needs to be closer and the streetscape needs to put the pedestrian in charge. While you are doing this, you might as well shorten the short side of blocks and add a few northing roads, or make square blocks with courtyards.

Bonus problem: MD RT40 "the highway to nowhere" is a 50ft deep cut that bisected a thriving black community when it was built. The city fell hard after that for various reasons, but since it did not much redevelopment and infrastructure restructuring was completed in the area - leaving the area filled with owners but the need for massive changes.

Bonus problem #2: Flooding and storm drains. the watershed for the streams that run into the harbor are concrete, now, so they flash the water down. The city needs some greenbelts inside the limits.

Bonus problem #3: The highland hills. Baltimore is not flat. I'm not talking about the potholes, but some of those statistically contribute to elevation variance IMO.

Bonus benefit: There is enough property to redevelop in the city to spur billions of dollars in growth. Get a good amount of three to five story buildings and you can bring in local mass transit, so leave room for future trolleys in the streetscape.

Bonus benefit: Urban farming. Baltimore has many parks, community gardens, and entrepreneurial farmers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   They know it will destroy the system and they benefit from the system.

What makes you think your system won't be destroyed, too? Rhetorical.

 but if the government can't solve the issue of greed certainly the 'pure market' (pure greed) can't solve the problems of greed either but will exacerbate it. 

Government initiates force with relative impunity. That is the difference.

 Whereas capitalist logic sees accountability as harming the freedom of the owners of capital.

I just wrote about how accountability is essential.

 Other people are just leeches on their success. And what is wrong with them buying and selling favors, when they are the successful ones and us the poor losers?

Is this an argument about how accountability is not essential? It is a straw man.

 always give the advantage to whoever has the most money rather than who is wronged. 

Always? What about reputation? Not between company and simple passengers, but in between companies. The insurance will suffer, the stock will suffer, any professional clientele of the company will feel like there may be less fairness if something goes wrong. Once people are accountable for teir assets, it is not smart to let another company manage them in any way that you won't be able to bring to justice in court. People who rely on that compnay for services will go elsewhere.

 they still have to raise the money to begin with. Which most people cannot feasibly do.

The funds are high right now because of a barrier to entry and the incomprehensibility of the law.

[The role of soil organic matter in sustaining soil fertility](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v371/n6500/abs/371783a0.html)

[Environmental and Economic Costs of Soil Erosion and Conservation Benefits](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/267/5201/1117)

Fertilizers do not increase soil health, merely nutritional availability for plants. There is just as much erosion on an unfertilized field as a fertilized field - all else the same. Without the mycological and plant root structures, the microscopic pockets of air, the microorganisms... Soil is just dirt. Yields decrease and chemical inputs have to go up to compensate for both the lack of inherent nutrient and the increased amount of runoff pulling chemical additives away from plants.

[Here is a visual example](https://youtu.be/nhVWNwCRpKg?t=25m35s) at 25 minutes.

And don't even think about dredging rivers and ports for eroded soil and shipping it back to the fields. It takes billions just to dredge a 14 mile stretch of river with heavy deposits behind a catching dam. </TEXT>

 Then stop using ancient farms causing desertification as an argument. You can't have it both ways.

Prove to me that plowing doesn't harm soil health and increase erosion.

No, the consumer did. Every transaction in a market attempts to pass the cost of supply onto the demand. At some point in the chain of supply there is a wrinkle, like I said. Proper pressure is not being placed on the grower when he comes to the wholesale market. </TEXT>

So in these inherent stages in the progression to complete communism: at this stage is the whole world under one government, necessarily? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, cutting the land is *exactly* what we have been doing the same for 10,000 years.

Second, it doesn't matter if they didn't have science. We do, and we are measuring what those people did to their own land. Roman authors complained of the process as it was happening. They had writing, so maybe you can relate to that. David R. Montgomery has a slide from one Roman author in his lecture you can go find. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If corn and sugar were more expensive, it would make more healthy forms of growing more competitive. This would bring down the luxury charge on organic beef. Simple.

I am well acquainted with both the argument you are trying to make and the nature of pre-industrial farms. Modern farms are very different. Farmers and stock do not live in the same conditions, both are improved. Farmers use technology when it makes sense - such as automation, transportation, health, and various sciences. The fact that a farm does not offload bad costs is not a function of decrepitude of practices and conditions.

Better stated: they have no objective to avoid it because there is no cost to throwing it away. We will agree this is not a free market growers are operating in, and there are social trivialities being reinforced by other factors in the supply chain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  some people have more important things to care about.

Ensuring social order is done naturally in every society. It is done in plain conversation, in written opinion, and in art. It is done in prejudices and insults, as well. It is done in court precedent and in law. I suppose I am asking if a sizeable amount of people did not assume the norm and reinforce it (but maybe act with disdain for it - or malign it privately) would socialism break down?

And a more subtle question - if it can break down, what are people "reverting to?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, you don't know we can take core samples of lake beds? There are ancient caches discovered all over the world preserved materials. Mortar in ancient structures and the ice in glaciers... All these places can hold pollen, seed, and dust samples which are hard evidence and dateable within centuries.

Besides that, the professor in the video (whose book I have read) mentions charts of data about half way through the lecture (at thirty minutes). These charts are made from modern studies on erosion. There are four sets, Agriculture, Mountainous, Soil-Covered Land, and Cratons (or extremely flat areas). I have listed them in order of maximum erosive potential. The most degrading agriculture ever measured was more erosive than a glacier scouring land. You know what dug the Great Lakes? Glaciers scouring the land. The chart does not show soil building, which can be measured separately but cannot catch up to the greater erosion rates. Even a forested hilltop will slowly crumble away.

I'm sorry for being insulting now. Would you like me to link you to youtube videos or National Geographic articles? I just got a thorn in my sole with conversing with you and I shouldn't have. </TEXT>

Durrr, I'm sorry I'm so dumb. :P That's totally not what I meant./s Obviously. But in comparison it is extremely promising.

 Not everyone can afford grass fed or USDA Prime you know.

... we both know why they can't, if you're here - but still: Anything not grass fed is simply worth the cost of protein and fat chemicals available for ingestion and less than that for the undesireable content. Just because the economy is leaking like a seive to regulation and tax doesn't mean eating bad food is normal all of a sudden.

The population growth subsidized by the subsidization of industrial agriculature is a cost of statism as well - don't forget that. People make different decisions with different incentives.

 You mean all farming.

There are farms which add value to anything they associate with. The air is clean, water runs clear, and the soil is healthy. People feel good there and the produce is superior. Open field monoculture negatively affects the value of everything associated - barring the produced goods.

 When you figure out exactly how many units of each product will sell every day, you let the supermarket owners know. Until then, your contention that they are all somehow making the same mistake when they could destroy their competitors by improving is just silly.

With your determined lack of imagination, I must wonder how you can even comprehend the market. Truly - you are a boggling mass of writhing incomprehensions.

Edit: last bit is harsh and I want to apologize. My error of jumping to conclusions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, there is no democratic accountability. That is a lie. Every politician but the rare exception either has a personal agenda or is bought off. - and if that does not weigh a decision the vote is up for trading for favors with others. If you meant regulation by departments, well, just look at the revolving doors at the executive level. The regultory departments are useless for controlling or prosecuting anyone with a fortune. No bankers, CEOs, or anyone else suitably connected goes away down the river.

 (as opposed to taking everything to court which punishes the victims of these negative externalities with exorbitant costs for legal fees)

This is a simple tort reform issue where in some places a losing defendant is not made to pay the plaintiff's court fees.

The market isn't failing when it comes to negative externalities - the precedent has simply not had a chance to catch up to the science. In the days of railroads the companies were sued for starting fires with the sparks from their engines' smokestacks. After losing to ranchers, farmers, and old ladies the companies added spark catchers. We've come a long way since then but the government has gotten in the way of the courts.

 Even small business owners do not want to worry about losing their house because something bad happened at their store or restaurant. 

This fear exists because of both a litigious streak in modern society enabled by bad, morally relative, law and a loophole-ridden tax system which people use limited liability to protect themselves from (some, as they try to game the loopholes). But don't turn your nose up at the small to medium business owner who tried to loop a loop put there by a large corporation as a political lobbying job.

 Capitalism requires this and other actions by the state in order to be somewhat stable, moral hazards and abuses be damned.

If we laid no hands on the free trade of goods, services, and ideas, people would be personally culpable to the actions of their company properties - including stakeholders - and systems would be available to address these matters and enforce them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Organic farmers have just recently shown higher profits than conventional farmers.

Alternative methods include incorporating cover crops, using a seed drill instead of plowing, alleycropping, forest gardening, and grazing animals over the fields. Some organic farmers still use pesticides and herbicides but use ones approved by third parties to meet certain guidelines to protect the environment, farmer, and consumer.

Meat production is done industrially as well. When compared to well-raised meats, it is sickly, anemic, and has a poor nutrient profile. That is a cost on the consumer and supporting it in any way is a cost on the taxpayer.

Industrial farming generates other externalities in the environment, consumer, and farmer which are not costs passed on to the consumer. They are shouldered in various levels by everyone.

I don't advocate emptying buildings and ending business sectors and crap, but I do think that if food costed the true price we wouldn't waste a third before it reached the supermarket and not a small percentage after that. The landfills of California are filled with perfectly fine produce that simply didn't get sold at the right price. That is a large efficiency which means there is  wrinkle in the market that can be ironed out. I think government subsidies stand in the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is substantial data on soil erosion by open field agriculture all the way back to the desertification of the fertile crescent. Our ancestors cut down all the trees and tilled all the soil until it ran into the rivers and silted them up, then once the land was purged of organic matter it stopped holding water to regulate rivers and became desert with flash floods. This happened in Greece, China, Asia Minor, the Tiber River valley, and almost happened in the American Colonies. Ur, Ostia, and Joppatowne were all ports - now they are 150, 20, and 3 miles inland, respectively.

Oh, and the cities buried in the Sahara were screwed by a change in the axis of the earth. Its there in the archaeological record.

<TEXT> There is very little compassion in the way people conduct business, today. That is true. Nestle's water crimes and big oil's world-warping effects are extremes of scale - but not conscience. You can find the same cruelty of externalizing costs to society in every town and city. People think they are not responsible for the pollution and waste and poisoning of our physical and social space as they go about their jobs, but the people making decisions certainly are.

As a Catholic libertarian I want nothing more than to be able to tell people that limiting liability through a contract which relies on some government to stop responsibility passing onto the owners is ruining the market all the world over. Companies hide so much in beareaucracy and fed-propped national banks that there is no accountability and they are sucking up the money as fast as it can be printed. To quip: socialism for the rich. It works out quite well for them, though they enter into it actively, voluntarily, and with full control over the government - which is the only way it would work at any scale.

There is a philosophically classic view of humanity which defines morality and natural rights as they are described by the indeniable truths which relativism in all forms (not academically physical) strives to deny. [However, every time it tries to deny one truth it leans heavily on all the others.](https://youtu.be/Lgcd6jvsCFs) To act human is not to act rationally, but to attempt to do so through whatever haze of explanations life has given you. It is wonderful when a person stumbles through the haze to a path which leads them to objective morals and subjective material value because those are a [understanding rather than an explanation.](https://youtu.be/l_VYCqCexow)

My answer is basic, though leaves the implications not enumerated.

Corporatism is due to entrenched relativity of the responibility of property and employment contracts.  Consumerism is due to a lack of meaning and understanding in human lives. We can probably agree on the current situation, encapsulated in those two statements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Certified Organic is known for not being the most natural. It is used by many people with more money than heart to buy into the Organic market without even having to stop spraying or paying their corporate sales reps. There is no reason Whole Foods' new program should be liable to simply stamp an OK on CO crops. Pay no rents, John Mackey, but why didn't you just start an independent certification business outright?

Here is the letter from CI: [PDF](http://cornucopia.org/Letter-to-John-Mackey-6-23-15.pdf)

Might very well be funded by people who don't like being called out on practices not as organic as they try to sell their crops or the companies that sell the chemicals and equipment. It is natural to complain about having to change practices to adhere to *another* set of standards - and CI is taking advantage of that to attach their less reasonable demands to.

It sounds like Whole Foods is trying to give their customers the ability to pay up front for what would otherwise be an economic externality on the farm side with this system. That isn't CO's goal. Maybe these farmers should drop the CO label and settle down with Reasonably Grown. </TEXT>

The severe  tornadic storm arrived the day that the British Troops had set fire to the Capitol, the White house and other public buildings. The storm's rains would douse those fires. The tornado did major structural damage to the residential section of the city. More British soldiers were killed by the tornado's flying debris than by the guns of the American resistance.  The tornado blew off roofs and carried them high up into the air, knocked down chimneys and fences and damaged numerous homes. Some homes were destroyed. It lifted two pieces of cannon and deposited them several yards away. At least 30 Americans were killed or injured in the heavily damaged buildings and an unknown number of British were killed and injured. (Lat./Long. = ...)

<TEXT> One more reason for smaller government, I suppose. :P

Complaining about the cost of government doesn't make sense whether the resistor even cares about large government or not. If people want smaller government, the cost to make a new center is a convenience cost which also improves representation. Two small centers have more overhead costs but are easier to keep everything else small through activism and involvement. If people don't care about size and spending, then wtf. They probably want to keep the people who want to leave tied up under their elective power to get benefits. Shame!

Not saying you are complaining. Thank you for introducing me to that. It is very interesting.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What if someone bought all the land of a watershed above a tributary stream in an American desert or other currently non-arable land?

Mildly re-shape the land to hold the water and plant the native species back (not a statement against non-native species). Check dams, swales, stream calming, berms, planting mounds... maybe even groundwater-recharge wells like in India.

First of all, I can think of few better ways to improve the value of land making this a very exciting investment.

Second, the people downstream will be affected positively and negatively (although the argument might be made that not taking the optimal flow for a watershed into account is not something you could sue for).

Third, would the government have something to say about that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you cook with that stove, I suggest getting a washable curtain to hang between your bed area and the kitchen area. Make sure you wash it and I suggest using TriSodium Phosphate in the wash. 1/8 - 14 cup per load. The TSP may harm colors, so simple solids or white is best. Make sure you get the real stuff, in the paint aisle of a hardware store. This will make sure the soap releases from the cloth once it has attached to the grease and smoke particles. Better than getting grease on all the walls in your apartment. The hood fan won't collect everything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reducing "Social Distance" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-15 05:41:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Read an article](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/thank-you-chinese/395660/?single_page=true) on /r/travel, today.

 And then another will announce Gei wo yan!, literally Give me salt!, with no sign of a please or thank you involved... A Chinese linguist, Kaidi Zhan, says that using a please, as in Please pass the salt, actually has the opposite effect of politeness here in China. The Chinese way of being polite to each other with words is to shorten the social distance between you. And saying please serves to insert a kind of buffer or space that says, in effect, that we need some formality between us here.

Reading and seeing scenes like this has always reinforced the idea of closeness. A family huddled around a small fire sharing a sparse meal; a pack of soldiers or workers performing a task with few commands; some friends gesturing to pass the drink along.

Does Social Distance have another name?

What is the most poignant example you can recall? </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Very good.](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Rand_Paul_Immigration.htm)

Here's the plan. Secure the border. Make congress enact a detailed plan instead of just ordering a department to do so with little forcing them to. Once the border is secure, find a way for those who are not citizens yet to become legal - but not citizens directly. Eviction is not an option and citizenship is not fair. Bringing them into the legal workforce satisfies all parties... because in that process we can root out the criminals.

The process will not be immediate, and will hopefully coincide with economic growth that will make sure they do not get blamed for taking the jobs from American citizens.

I don't know why some Catholics want open borders; it certainly isn't for the economic reasons that Rand Paul understands the benefits. There can be no open borders right now between us and the dire situations in South America. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And it isn't like we are going to rid the House and Senate of the established old boys club. There isn't going to be a socialist revolution that gets campaign finance reform through in any meaningful way. The only hope is for some champions in the legislature to take what they are given by a president to reduce the size and scope of government. We aren't going to fix this through the courts, either.

*And* no constituitional amendement process is going to happen, much less go well for us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From at least the perspective that humans are rational and have natural rights which extend from their capabilities rather than their needs, yet a government has to impose force to curtail those rights in favor of the needs of other humans for the purpose of civil society.

Society can be civil without central government, but people have a hard time imagining what it would look like since it has been so long since any group of people has lived like this. In the end, there is no central government tying the entire human race toether so we are all effectively anarchists, anyway.

<TEXT> It is telling that instead of considering whether people should be paying taxes for this or not, you went straight to talking about how goosenecking money through administrative channels should not be forgotten when considering how people will be forced to pay for their healthcare through taxes, as if that was terribly different from being forced to pay any other way.

*The simple fact that healthcare is perceived, by you, like a universal public service instead of a commodity is really something.* I'm very interested that your reasoning is not purely ideological at the surface, and I have to agree with what you say in many ways.

But it is the way America has treated it's healthcare and nutritional guidelines which is horrendous. People treated healthcare like a public service and the public servants got it wrong (as humans are known to make mistakes and/or be corrupt). One set of rules across the country and a news service to back it up then made sure that nobody was breaking dogma and getting away with it. If deciding how to treat the sick and feed ourselves wasn't managed on a national level, we'd have shaken off our stupor by now through competition and offering more options. Instead we basically became a technocracy on the mental and nutritional health fronts for eighty years. The externalities of poor decisions in these areas is extremely dire, no doubt, but would not be so severe at the present period if the incorrect funding levels, subsidies, and programs had not been held above competition. Long before now, the evidence would have made it clear mental patients needed more supervision and less psychotropic drugs, saturated fats and cholerserol are not evil and are not well managed by statins, and the general state of medical insurance is a gaping wound in American finance practice no matter which way it is looked at.

I'm not going to say I haven't looked at the data, not that I should know exactly which data you mean from the perfectly broad statement, but why would data make anything more clear given what we agree on? You don't know me, but I have listened and read up on the different views.

What we have is a difference of philosophical opinion, and I'm not sure you accept that, nor understand the consequences.

You are opining government is the best and only way to provide healthcare, it seems. I do not share that conclusion. The place we really disagree is probably the definition of rights. I want to know how you think a democracy can operate when that most basic of assumptions is contested?

And, btw, you never asked me to "question the claim stated in the last statement of your first paragraph." I asked you a question and you obliged. Thank you for that. I kinda riled you up. I wanted an answer so I did that on purpose. Rand used very strong language, and was ultimately making a flawed argument as it is heard in the [video.](http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/diverting-non-urgent-emergency-room-use-can-it-provide-better-care-and-lower-costsd) I just found the entirety of the video and will be reviewing it. Without the context of philosophical matter supporting it and cushioning it, which I am not sure he even provided in the hearing, the argument is laughable on the face. That doesn't mean the statement he intended was, necessarily. </TEXT>

Sweden: History of economic conservatism. The boat is slowly turning back that way, as well. Last decade it became apparent in policy circles that the honeymoon with socialism was ending.

Norway: Can you say oil? Oil.

To note how much these populations still pay in taxes is to realize how much the socialist state requires. Factor in the differences between us and them and you see the price would be higher here. More cronyism, more economic stagnation, less oil per capita. Americans are not prepared to give that much - just like our government is not prepared to handle it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the UN should make vaccinations mandatory the world over? Why not let the states decide?

The other option is letting the community of insurance and lawyers find the right level of risk and indemnity. This will create a reaal price for going unvaccinated and will cause those people to self-select and make a value judgement on whether they want to live in the woods, alone, or in society with a vaccination. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get back on the horse and try to think patiently and scientifically about what factors may be causing your hair to get more oily after being fine for a while. Two months isn't that long of a time for our bodies.

Did you alter your diet? Splurge on something?

Have you tried baking soda, vinegar, lemon juice, etc other home cleaners? Maybe your hair needed more than a hot water rinse, maybe it was actually dirty - or maybe your scalp was. Maybe you didn't brush for a day. Maybe the temperature changed with the season.

I keep a sulfate and silicone-free shampoo around in case my hair gets really bad, like if I decide to use Brylcreem and then need to remove it or I go swimming or to a construction site.Sometimes a day in the inner city or on the farm makes my hair dirty enough. If I need to clean, then a light application is all I use. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   The trick here is how (should he be elected) can Sanders (or anyone else) remove the bureaucracy and money interest to make the government work for all and not for a few.

I can't see this happening in any way other than an increase in subsidiarity and truly or effectively closing federal departments. I have not seen that Bernie is for this, but there is time for me to find out.

Rand is certainly for this. I wonder if Carly Fiorina is as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I guess you didn't watch the video.

The plow has ruined entire civilizations. That doesn't mean nations or cities... it means economies. The Bronze age ended in famine and war because the plow created a technology bubble. But instead of money, it was a bubble of human population. The soil eroded away into the valleys and seas and then people died.

Go 31 min into that video and you'll see how not all agriculture decimates soil. Note that the graph only shows erosion, not soil growth. </TEXT>

The plow has killed more people than the sword.

<TEXT>  This is another case of creating more problems than actually resolving. By further limiting the already limited parking situation downtown and within the Inner Harbor, you place more vehicles on the road at any given moment whom are all actively fighting for already limited parking spaces.

I agree with you, here. Without ample street life, the city still requires weeknight and weekend injections of commerce and places for parents to park in the day to take children to attractions. Removing parking garages can be done after all the other problems are met and mass transit projects have been completed. Parking *lots*, however, are a blight. The ones in Mount Vernon seem to be hanging around because of management, profit margin, or fear of failure issues. </TEXT>

For instance, wherever you find a gathering of gentlemen with canes you can be sure at least some will tap it on the floor or a desk in applause rather than the relatively guttural reaction of hand clapping.

<TEXT> I think it is very important to learn that carbohydrates either are already sugars or the human body converts them to sugars and that sugars are addictive. Sugars, particularly fructose, have various proven effects on the human brain and some deleterious ones which require more studies. What is known is that sugars trigger more "happiness" signaling chemicals. Eating them consistently makes the receptors matching these chemicals partially close, making the effect of all triggers lessen.

A calorie-restrictive diet based on carbohydrates will leave people hungry and lacking "happiness" chemical reception. Willpower is not possessed and/or planning is not accessible to everybody in the amount required to follow their chosen diet. I think being hungry *and* depressed at the same time is what causes people to fail to follow their own goals.

EDIT: Re-wrote second sentence, second paragraph. Original: "The willpower or planning that it takes to follow this kind of diet is not possessed and is not accessible to everybody." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a staph infection on my wrist in college and when I went to the hospital they numbed it and let is sit for a few minutes. Two guys come in and get ready to cut it open and drain it. "You might feel a little tugging."

They sterilize and get the scalpel... and boy, I feel that tugging. These guys are cutting my skin and I can't feel any pain but I can feel *everything else.* POP!

A little pus explodes on to the mat they have down. The guy cutting says "Oh, that was cool. A big one." His assistant just nods and mutters, "yup."

They milk more out of it and then clean it and stuff paper in it. A bandage goes on and I'm outta there.

It is really weird to experience things that would normally have one sensation. Like, if your finger wasn't frozen you probably would not have heard the sound. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ACA has two main ideas.

* require every person to get insurance

* thousands of pages trying to make it easier for people to get insurance through personal means, employers, or state assistance.

Notice how it does not say that the state must provide health care; it says the individual must acquire health care.

IMO, health care is a debacle because of two things. Pharmacuetical, medical insurance, and hospital companies are protected from competition by lobbying the government and professional licensing associations. The companies are using the state to make mioney off us, which is not capitalism. The other problem is our perverse attachment to employer-provided healthcare. This started being a thing in WWII, but the job market has changed drastically and it makes no sense for offices and restaraunts to offer this when people might change jobs yearly. Every three years is common. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a coconut allergy. Why does it take so long for the rash to go away? Is the process the body goes through for eliminating proteins recognized as allergic inefficient?

If anyone has literature or links, I would appreciate them.

I know all about allergies up to the point where antibodies are supposedly attaching and capillaries have dilated to send in the white blood cells... but I can't find anything that tells me what happens next.

<TEXT> My reply:

 That is quite a quandary. Opportunity breeding decisions. You can save local businesses by reserving eggs for them or you can use the money to invest in people who follow your model (I know you aren't interested in personally expanding). Either of those takes people coming to you and being honest with their finances and goals - and you have to be sure of their honesty and integrity. I think you will be able to do both by riding the wave for people and places which do not come to you for help (or do not warrant it), but letting some partake reduced prices. The only sour point there is those who see a double standard or are turned away not be humble enough to understand. If that seems insurmountable, take the money and invest it in more farms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't seen Tomorrowland, yet, but I can wonder why there are no bathroom cleaners. Automation relieved society of the need for that particular menial task.

Automation currently removes the demand for jobs like airline receptionists and secretaries, people who just punch tickets and register information. A user interface and networked customer information system automated 95% of the job, so we can do the last 5% by typing in some info and swiping our card. There is still demand because a human touch is still more agile than a human's code.

It isn't like people are pre-destined to be low-skilled workers (not that I think anyone thinks that, anymore). Automation can also make it easier to live independently for people who might fall into those tasks today and the many that did, previously. People both fall into those tasks and life is not made easier through automation for various reasons which we may not entirely disagree on.

Did the movie preclude that in some way? Were there renegade air conditioning specialists? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough, but that is as hippy-dippy as it gets.

People who engage with this design ethic have increased quality and profits at the same time. Joel Salatin has a well-known example of an extremely successful operation. Mark Shepard documented how he was raking in cash while his plow and corporate seed monoculture neighbors were suffering. There is a good example of an orchard which bucked the norm and did a few things: stopped spraying, diversified cultivars, and increased biodiversity in the orchard; this orchard was a hobby until he did this and it turned a profit. This isn't some get rich quick thing, these are prominent examples which took years to figure out the pieces and fit them together correctly. I can link you to short youtube videos which pertain to each of the mentioned people.

<TEXT> Agriculture has the etymology agri+culture. Agri meaning sky (as in, open fields); culture meaning exactly what we think. Since this is a movement which has found plowing (widely considered a sign of civilization) as detrimental to perpetual habitation, the founders thought a direct challenge and contrast was fitting. Hence perma was substituted for agri. Perma meaning just what you'd expect. All they mean is that this is a design ethic which is meant to find the best way to create a permanent, non-cyclic and non-self-destructive, way of enabling human settlement and life. </TEXT>

Permaculture is just like applying the ideas of human action to each part of an endeavor. "What behaviors, inputs, and outputs does a chicken have?" Then you give it what it needs and use its behaviors and outputs to their best use. Chickens are omnivores and scratch the dirt, so many systems elect to run cows over pasture and follow with chickens. The chickens eat flies for protein and spread the manure. They also eat different greens that grow in the meadow.

Permaculture is a design system, not a lifestyle or save the planet cult.

If you want to know more, let me know. </TEXT>

Permaculture, Strong Towns/ Lean Urbanism/ New Urbanism, and American Libertarianism are three of my interests which are intersecting in this article.

The idea of a responsible supply chain is very interesting. It recognizes externalities of various kinds, empowering journalists and academics to monitor the modern goods and services and supports paying the costs up front which would otherwise be deferred to pollution or human strife.

Come to think of it, /r/keto also intersects, here, because if Allan Savory and Dr. Peter Attia are both right there is a very obvious solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know what I like about a parade? Hearing the drums of the band getting closer and closer. The brass and cymbals coming into range and slowly getting more clear. The sound of a band coming changes if you are in a small town, or near a park or pond, or nestled in the canyon of a city center's skyscrapers. The echo and reverberation can confuse the distance. Then the band comes around the corner and you hear the real power of a marching band.

I enjoy the sight and smell of old cars, hot rods, firetrucks, and military surplus rolling down the street. I enjoy seeing the community and trade groups because they show the vibrancy of a town. I enjoy seeing the Shriners race miniature cars to delight children. I'm not a fan of having children ride floats in parades - it isn't where the children want.

You know what I didn't like about a parade, once? I walked in front of the Macy's Day Parade one year and being in NYC before and after the parade was the worst part, everything else was ok. The Macy's freight elevator was filthy (if you haven't been in the belly of an American city, you don't know what I mean) and we were accosted by the unfortunate mentally handicapped who are homeless on the streets.

A parade is a hopeful thing when done right, but it is easy to do wrong. I don't like watching the Macy's Day Parade because it is done wrong. It isn't personable and it isn't for the person on the street. You can't televise a parade - not the real parades. How long can a parade really be?

People don't like parades because some parades are done wrong. Keep it short. One band in front, one near the back. Have marshals to keep the pace; don't rely on stopping and starting. Only kids who are directly involved should be in the parade; no idle wavers, even in float contests. Idle wavers subtract from the audience. The last piece in a parade should always be obvious, and possibly traditional. Cities still have to keep it short and should consider neighborhood or district parades. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One previous post which was about the rash ended with OP discovering a macadamia nut allergy. Keto rash looks exactly like when I eat coconut protein (I have to use refined coconut oil - which is a shame because I love the taste!).

Red and slightly puffy, itchy but forgettable, and lasts for weeks. Seems to appear above the diaphram and below or between the pectoral muscles/ adipose deposits. All in all not fun, but I can't say that is what you are experienceing for sure and I have not found a way to end the reaction faster. I also have no idea what a protein allergy can do to your kidneys, if anything.

I can tell you that I survive instances without cortisol because if there is one thing I hate more than an itch it is a smelly, sticky undershirt.

<TEXT> The take-away from that should be that those companies don't need subsidies. You should look and see who owns the roads, too (government). So let's say almost all methods of major transport accept government money.

Why are we doing that? There are myriad reasons we are in this state, but the effect is to make travel less expensive for the less wealthy because taxes are progressive, right?

Two things to say to that: some people think the tax structure isn't progressive enough and these companies have made their services more expensive because once you get into the pen the trough of government money overfloes.

Cut off the money. </TEXT>

I think one of the more accessible (and short) works which gives more detail is [*Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations*](http://smile.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery-ebook/dp/B007V2D4JO) by David R. Montgomery.

If there had been record rains instead of record drought, the dirt would have washed away. Just like Boston received red snow, the floods would have been red with soil. Montgomery has good information on how early American farming practices caused massive gullies in the Carolinas and northern Georgia around the time of the Civil War. Thankfully, the seed drill and cover cropping has resolved the most extreme negative effects of agriculture on soil. - it is still odd to think that the plow has probably killed more people than the sword through instgating droughts, floods, and famines.

Montgomery has a few lectures on youtube. In at least one, [he includes material left out of the printed book because it was too data-centric for the intended audience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU) </TEXT>

Putting on my amateur urban planning cap, I will agree with your second sentence.

<TEXT> But, seriously, some people have reported that their 4pm drop in awareness and energy is avoided on the Keto diet. The thinking is that since the body is not running on carbs there are no blood sugar waves. The liver can generate glucose for the brain (and some other organs) but it does not usually do this outside ketogenisis. Having the liver generate brain food on demand smooths out the swings.

I have a hard time staying awake all day even with distributed meals (in a sedentary job), so this is something I want to try some day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Andres Duany has kind of had a turn of heart on New Urbanism - since being one of the founding designers! He now touts Lean Urbanism.

The difference is how change is brought on. NU used political structures and developer relationships to modify sections of the built environment (or build them from scratch, more often); LU tries to fix existing areas (not precluding redevelopment) by relaxing and eliminating regulatory and zoning ordinances. There isn't supposed to be a difference in community involvement, but instead of the process in NU being driven by the town or city, in LU it is driven by developers big and small. the idea is to set up a system of [guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl0hMfqNQ-g) which everyone can use to build a cohesive and healthy town or city rather than the NU way of master-planning everything. The small business owner isn't squished quite as much this way and the process becomes an opportunity for good design and planning principles to take over in a town or city, rather than political squabbling and cronyism. </TEXT>

Or, at least, a heroic image to his acquaintance and superiors. Even Anakin could not hide his darkness from his loved ones for long.

The linked story is a good example of what you could expect from a Sith "hero." There is a short intro plot in the first five minutes and a then a longer one which goes for the whole.

<TEXT> I keep seeing mentions that ["...replacing saturated fats from red meat and dairy with vegetable fats high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats will reduce risks of heart disease."](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/fat-carbs-heart-disease-diabetes_n_6262590.html)

But I have not seen any studies differentiating between *replacing* sat fats and simply *increasing* unsat fats.

One would expect that in any diet the existing dietary fats would have to be replaced t omake room for the unsat fats to not simply increase calories.

The only problem is that people are using the studies to argue for less sat fats when that may not be the motive force behind the benefits.

I still need to find and read the studies but wanted to ask. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then you should oust all democrats for making the state do more with less. They lied and told you they were doing great, we only need little tax raises (and huge municipal bonds). The education budgets grew and the transportation fund was used.

But nobody got a raise except the people with nameplates on the desk. Some people, like the county council in Baltimore County, gave themselves a raise.

So I don't know if you are a person who says "well, both parties are shit." Even so, tell me if there is another option: 

* Cut what things the state does.

* Cut the cost of how the state does things.

* Increase money available to the state to do things.

Then ask yourself whether the last two are remotely possible.

You'll find yourself in denial, or maybe start wondering if the state could do a little less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will give you that his definition of planning is restrictive and punitive.

 Urban planning is the idea that you need some sort of central authority to guide the development of cities, economic investement, and private development

I don't see why he would not make a broader statement which is more inclusive to the need for specialization in the understanding of planning no matter the existance of a central authority or not. He might just be a little exited or has an unreasonable stance on this. In any case, I think it is an extreme and odd statement that stick out from the rest of what I see as a sensible set of statements and arguments.

 Rather than understanding the suburban growth movement and smart growth movement as differing ideas that served different needs at different points in time, he tries to paint them as the same thing, dual aspects of this imaginary ideology he calls "interventionism," as if planners were just sitting around, thinking, "How can we best intervene this year?" The truth is, planners are almost entirely beholden to public opinion. Their job isn't to hand down decisions from on high, but usually just to try to make some compromise out of all the competing needs of a community, according to open, democratic processes.

This is something I want to respond to. Sorry this isn't a full response comment, I should get back to this.

 Ok, so I watched to the end of the video, but I still don't know--what are the unintended consequences?

Unintended consequence of Natl Highway system: solidification of car as dominant means of transport, bringing us car-dependant planning and relegating railroads to second-class land use.

Unintended consequence of car-dependant planning: Social stratification, urban decay, an institutionalized poor understanding of efficiant and dense planning. Also, excessive pollution.

 And what would the consequences be of not planning cities?

As I said up top, it is hard to believe he doesn't believe in any planning. The idea behind a free market is not to have no regulation whatsoever, but to have decentralized regulation. We discriminate against quality and waste, foresight and foolishness, health and disease, or find privately organized advocates for sensible positions on these. A sensible advocate for planning in a city would be well worth consulting. He is either wrong, or misrepresented his own position. I might read more of his work as I linked below to find out. Judging by how much they cut the interview, he seems much more composed on paper. </TEXT>

And just how do these "capitalists" do that? Through political force. You do not see political force as part of the problem, but you should consider that. If these people did not have politicians and bureaucrats who can use the force of law and supposed "public interest" at problems for relatively cheap buyoffs, then there would not be so many problems.

<TEXT> The cold fact is that everyone did experience a higher standard of living. Inequality may have risen (not sure, just saying it might've) but that doesn't mean blacks were less able to feed their families.

The state of de facto and de jure oppression is separate in most part.

Besides, if you grew up in the depression, then fought in WWII, then raised your family in better economic conditions (though probably not better social conditions) you might have lived to see MLK and the civil rights movement.

<TEXT> Only from 1 hour after sunrise to 1 hour before sunset. A sword classifies as a "dangerous weapon," even if it is not specifically called out. Exceptions include hunting trips and transport.

It must not be concealed.

The charge of "Disturbing the Peace" is what I would expect to see if a police officer saw someone with a dangerous weapon.

The interesting part, for me, is that it does not saw anything about use. If you want to go practice /r/wma with a friend you can do so in public with real swords (but even training or wooden swords would be considered "d.w." imo). One would have to look up the rules for parks to see what restrictions are present. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Subbing.

I grew up in the [Christopher Erb house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Erb_House) in Maryland. Let me know if you want a post about it.

200yr old stone German immigrant house. Basement is center wall, the two stories and attic above are center hallway. Our floors are so crooked. There is a sister house and my personal theory is that the Erbs started to make a split floorplan but saw [Hampton Mansion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_National_Historic_Site) after finishing the basement and decided to change the plan.

Not until I happened upon a book about the similarities between the [Zwaanendael Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwaanendael_Museum) and the building it (in part) replicates did I know about jointery markings. The specialized language of rafter joining. I'd been sleeping under the exposed rafters for years.

The house is a form of Georgian colonial architecture. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  ...due to natural factors.

I am here to challenge that specific part of your answer. Not to say "I disagree," but to ask if you have considered the information I will share. It suggests that the perceived climate change event was actually man-made through a lack of understanding.

There are other authors who have stated this, but David R. Montgomery is the one which seems most accessible. His book [Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations](http://smile.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery-ebook/dp/B007V2D4JO) is just long enough to remark on many different instances of the phonomenon of erosion caused by agriculture dooming a population. He summarizes the book and shows some data which was left out for audience tailoring in [this lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU)

The floods, famines, and desertification of much of the meditarranean and middle east can be attributed to the cutting down of trees and plowing of loose soils until gone. Ur was a port city and now lies a hundred miles inland. The mountains of the levant used to be lush but are now dusty crags.

It does not seem that cyclical events caused the agricultural failure. [Milankovich cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) and [DansgaardOeschger events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger_event) could be, but I have not seen anyone claim it.

So the peoples of the Bronze Age ruined their land. This caused floods when there was no more soil and wooded plains to soak up the rain; famines when soil died under the knife of the plow; and a lack of strategic resources when wood was burned for fuel. This followed a population increase dependant on the use of deforested land. Once that land was desertified and decreased in yeild, scarcity strained the social structure.

I'm not an expert and I probably could have just dropped the link on you and asked the question "have you read this and do you agree?" instead of writing all that but I did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Modern swords" can mean a few things. You probably either mean swords of modern design (fantasy blades and such) or swords of ancient design made with modern technology (reproductions). It actually makes no difference because there is a reason swords ended up with the weights they did in the time they were used - that was the balance of power and agility desired. Even as carbon content increased with more steel (bringing on rapiers and the like), the weight stayed within a consistent range.

Most swords are about three pounds.

Does that sound "heavy" to you? That is less than half the weight of a gallon of milk. A sword cannot be too heavy because of the nature of the balance. Your hand is the fulcrum of a lever and on one end is more weight that the other. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I felt like it never even occurred to the author that I might be consciously making a choice.

People do make choices, but those choices are affected by the political structure in which they live, including coordination with businesses at various levels.

Another given in Strongtowns articles is that the sprawl occurred during a wasteful period and that tax revenue from suburbs rarely are enough to support the infrastructure. Just as local governments spent money poorly, so too have many American families - it can be hard on families to justify living in the suburbs when they would much rather exchange the nature and freedom with ease of access to jobs on cheap mass transit and high proximity to wants and needs. The problem comes from the market having been twisted away from dense construction of a quality which enables this. People complain about schools and crime, and the construction in cities recently is either for colleges, singles, or well-off families.

So why is that? American families *want* suburbia but many cannot afford it and would do well to move in. They can't because their house won't sell; they won't because they don't think it is a choice which will make them happy, safe, or prosperous; they can't because builders see basically no demand. Meanwhile, the tax receipts on sprawled areas are putting American towns in debt.

It can come off as insulting. I'm not going to lie. Strongtowns is facing this problem where people disagree because they think the writers disapprove of their choices. We just wish you had more choices, but known the *real cost* instead of having political involvement muddy that.

I, personally, drive 20-30 minutes to work. I live on the edge of a major city and can walk to grocery, gym, park, and church. Also, school, if we had kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah. I would count social conditioning as the opposite of something being thought about, but morals do appear in both cases of pressure and engineering.

So when I said reflection it meant an image, not a philosophical viewpoint (but it could have meant both). That was a little lazy of me. 

 We are made to be very very good to out fellow man, but only the good we think about.

 *or are forced to contend with due to social pressure*, as you point out.

 And then, only to people we define as fellow man.

And boy, that is the mother of all "nurture" scenarios.

What made Mal such a great character, and what makes everyone pine for the unexplored depth of the characters and universe, is that mix of social pressure and constructed morals. I think we felt like those people on the tiny space boat showed us more about ourselves than we wanted to know, but in a slightly-detached way which made it easy to enjoy, rather than suffer through. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it is between how stupid she is and how willing to flip-flop to get the young vote she is.

I think she really cared about that issue.

It will almost definitely come down to *what* young vote she'll try and get... probably the Tumblr one. She is all about social justice and not realyl about connecting with anyone male that isn't in a union. So she'll probably try and institute some kind of mature game registration or a new rating for inclusiveness or something. She won't ban them, just put layers of control on them.

That is, if the legislature returns to the Dems. I need to look up on that chance for 2016, but anything is possible two or four years after that. </TEXT>

Black as the pit from pole to pole,

I thank whatever gods may be

For my unconquerable soul.

-

In the fell clutch of circumstance

I have not winced nor cried aloud.

Under the bludgeonings of chance

My head is bloody, but unbowed.

-

Beyond this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the Horror of the shade,

And yet the menace of the years

Finds and shall find me unafraid.

-

It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll,

I am the master of my fate,

I am the captain of my soul.

 **You are now the fastest pair and mixed pair to ever row across the Pacific, the first couple to row from California to Hawaii, the first Finnish person to row across any ocean, and Trulia is in an ongoing acquisition by Zillow for $3.5 billion in stock. You must feel on top of the world. So whats next for you?**

 I try not to cling on to any accomplishments or results, whether they are good or bad. I like moving forward, staying active, and building new things. After catching up on sleep a bit, my life will hopefully include more of all those things. But probably no more rowing for a while! </TEXT>

What do you think?

The page isn't clear whether they mean support or legal eligibility, but its just a facebook meme so I don't expect much. Legal eligibility is ludicrous in my opinion. Restricting the field of candidates like that is asking for trouble.

More and more, I'm thinking a president just needs to have the priorities, principles, and political support. The first two make him a candidate, the third gets him in. Service in the armed forces supports the third part. Military service definitely puts people in a hotbed social environment where many will decide who they are and what they believe - galvanizing them to stick to what they discover for life. This, the ingrained posture, vocal respect, and personal grooming habits are what draw civilian voters to military candidates.

Obviously, none of these are specially reserved to candidates from our armed services.

What seems to set them apart is first-hand knowledge of the place where so much of our tax money goes, where people say our freedoms have been won, and where many of our American heroes come from. The mainstream calls every soldier a hero - but this isn't the case. [You know it isn't.](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/12/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/) Military culture is filled with rascals and fools, pompous jerks and outright destructive personalities. Civilians have a problem relating to what they see, and do not spend enough time reading about or talking with service members to understand the full picture. Assuming the people who rise tot the top and then put in a lot for president know the financial and internal political situation is unreasonable, but you never see them tested publicly.

Many have not served, but why can't they prove to voters that being inside the armed services isn't the same as *knowing* the armed services? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Matterport](http://matterport.com/) is a new product and related service which enables the rapid scanning of a building's interior, [viewable online in browser.](https://matterport.com/try/)

This [blog post](http://www.valueoc.com/2015/01/05/2015-year-matterport/) sings some pretty high praises, so I thought I'd ask here.

The website for OC Matterport, mentioned in the blog, works ok in IE. Doesn't work in Chrome, so I found [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ocmatterport/timeline).

I have been following Matterport for a while. They use Microsoft Kinect sensors and custom software. Packages for scanning from the company start at $299. The device costs $4,500 and Matterport controls their own hosting services with year plans valued at increments of $500 (three tiers).

That means the company has to scan at least 130 homes of minimal size per year with one full time employee. I wonder how fast the price of OC Matterport increases.

**EDIT: There is integration with Zillow, [Check out this listing](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/31356-Isle-Vis-Laguna-Niguel-CA-92677/25575500_zpid/). In the "Facts" section is a link to the matterport tour of the house.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone seen the irony of statists protesting, saying that their rights are being oppressed and they need more protection... even though by many definitions they think their rights come from the government? So how are their rights being crossed if they are not legislated, yet? How can they conceive of asking for a right before it is voted on?

[This started bugging me after I watched this clip of Monty Python's Life of Brian.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBOQzSk14c) Their intent may be to joke at the whole situation or just one perspective, I don't know for sure.

<TITLE> Purpose of Notary Positions in Polycentric Law Systems </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-06 00:18:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If a company is to form to manage and adjudicate contracts, it must verify the language, assets, and persons in each case. The person traditionally given this responsibility is the lawyer - or a notary. Notaries usually have all the powers of a lawyer except the ability to try a case before a court of law. 

Do you think a law company will employ notaries directly [as the French government does](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notaire), or should they be hired directly by private citizens to review contracts [as Americans do.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary)

Seeing as a company would have to review the contract before agreeing to it anyway, I see companies putting out standard contracts forms like Legalzoom but keeping notaries on hand for custom work. This then enables them to let customers use either self-reporting or freelance notaries for basic and rote contracts. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-12-18 15:47:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I do not have children, yet, but my coworker and I had a discussion about his teenage son who is grasping internet security more slowly than hoped. The father's approach has been largely hands-off, but he realizes this isn't working. The child has a small gaming addiction, has lost money on scam trades, and has riddled his laptop with viruses to the point when it was brought into a specialist he commented it was the worst he'd ever seen.

Most of us grew up alongside the early internet. We can tell a sketchy website from a respectable one. We know the premise of scams enough to weed out most offensive encounters. Most importantly, we know to ask questions of communities and be generally cautious. Some of us even know to RTFM.

A brief search yielded to me only product pages and advice against revealing personal information. Nothing about not clicking the flashing "10,000th VISITOR" buttons (and their devious descendants) or giving out gaming account info.

Are there any subs or resources on Reddit for this? Are there any very good books on the topic? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am just west of Baltimore, Md and am leaving my apartment in the middle of the lease. The lease dictates I pay rent for two months after I leave or until the apartment is occupied, whichever comes first and the rent will be pro-rated until occupied. I have one full months rent as security, but would like to make sure I escape the second. I can harp on my specific apartment, but the office can't push it due to fair housing laws.

I was in a junior apt. You get a wall between living/dining and the bedroom, but not an actual door.

One issue is that the area is close to areas of ill repute, but we don't have these problems in the apartment complex.

What websites should I use, make sure I submit reviews to, and whats the best way to get this in front of college kids? I just had the idea I should ask what colleges my building-mates attend.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> On the candidacy of Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party. (Opinion response to RARE.us article) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-07 20:15:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  ["As a Republican, Johnson was twice elected governor of New Mexico. As a Libertarian, success is defined as getting 1 percent of the vote... There are also plenty of Republicans in competitive races who deserve to have a Libertarian candidate running against them. Rand Paul isnt one of them."](http://rare.us/story/gary-johnsons-foolish-rand-stand/)

The point of this article is that running a strong Libertarian Party candidate would spoil Rand Paul on the issues. It would undermine his support just enough for Rand to lose. Rand is certainly going to be the most sensible person on the stage if no LP candidate runs. If we want better now instead of best never, then the LP should just butt out this year - or at least high profile candidates should not run.

If libertarians want best now rather than better, then I'd love to hear your plan and where you are going to get a billion dollar war chest from. Also how will you get your candidate to shake the hand of every eligible voter in the US - that is what it would take for them to even consider an LP candidate *right now*. No LP candidate will have the media coverage, name recognition, or party machinery to make a dent in the (I am being quite honest) wasteland of American intelligence on politics. You need those multipliers as a matter of fact.

The point is not for Rand to win using the %1.76 of the vote he might get, that is obviously not the case. **The point is to support him. Give him the volunteers. Give him the money. That is how he can win in 2016.**

All the volunteers and money going to the LP doesn't have the multipliers Rand has going for him - meaning the media coverage, the hype, and the support of the Republican Party.

_________________________________________________

I don't expect everyone supports Rand Paul in this sub. I am not taking for granted that this is a Republican sub and not a libertarian one. As a matter of discussing political strategy that should not matter. I want to hear if you want LP to run a strong candidate to spoil Rand in the primary. I want to hear if you think I am missing something. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Silvio Gesell gets a TIL, and why his money was fruity. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Today Reddit found out about Silvio Gesell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdPIOUTd2k) via [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2i9sqm/til_a_man_called_silvio_gesell_once_created_free/). [The video has been seen previously on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1mgs6h/silvio_gesell_currency_and_the_economics_of_money/). The phenomena is generally known as [The Wrgl Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rgl#The_W.C3.B6rgl_Experiment).

Silvio Gesell's amazing shrinking money was like fruit.

Humans can trade in whatever means they wish. Most articles are traded today to indirectly gain goods and services later. We don't trade baskets for sheep, we trade baskets for dollars and then go trade dollars for sheep.

In a world of competing currencies, some are better stores of value than others. In a world of competing tradeable articles, most currencies fluctuate in value more than goods.

But fruit is not one of these goods. Fruit is only useful once it has reached a certain maturity, has certain provisions for care and preparation, and reduces in value over time - just like Gesell's currency.

There is a time and place for every money, but I think it is very funny to think of a whole town trading in fruit and would love for someone to show me who - if anyone or everyone - got the thin end of the pear in this case. Take us to the core of the issue. Explain how this currant-cy was actually a detriment; or maybe that this is a case of the right recipe at the right lime. </TEXT>

Jeff Tucker posted this on Facebook after being tipped off he was quoted in the hitpiece. I went to the comments to think over maybe making a comment about how Common Core is basically the reverse, but your friendly local government will make your life hell if you seriously oppose it - and is going to bankrupt your county budgets. As usual, I decided not to bother... but I found a gem.

**Leif Leifnephewson [Mostly Harmless] 8 hours ago**  
Libertarianism is just as evil as communism and nazism. It's not killed as many yet, but it will. Centrists and leftists really need to stop fighting 20th century battles and open their eyes to this new enemy.

If you would like to see for yourself, find the comments section off to the left of the body text near the end and sort by "hot threads."

Some of the comments are quite good, but I am sad they are wasting time in a Slate comment section. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A brief thought on whether Microsoft will continue development. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-25 22:36:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think Microsoft has been moving to hardware for some time - or at least hardware technology licensing - but only came to develop the Surface device with the hopes that public schools would use them in coming years.

Most of us remember taking plenty of state-run tests in grade school. Gaining information on students and schools has been a top-level topic for public school advocates and large publishers for about a decade. These groups got together recently to attempt to bring their vision of a 21st century school to fruition. All the ["future classroom"](http://youtu.be/mPUfwX4Nqy8) videos made by Microsoft, Pearson, HP, or non-profits have tablets and large interactive screens. Microsoft has [their vision](http://youtu.be/aJu6GvA7jN8) in heavy research, as seen in this [lab visit](http://youtu.be/rJ1p5SD3sOM)... well... part of it.

The other part is already in your hands.

Top publishers and education non-profits came together to create the Common Core standards for the United States. The Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest among the non-profits associated with the standards. These were created and then passed to the states via grant competitions. [The standards are picking up flak,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-greene/how-the-common-core-lost-_b_5694139.html) but not only for how unworkable they are in the classroom. The standards also required legalizing and creating a series of databases for each state in which every school and child is tracked. They call it infant to workforce data tracking.

Some people out there have plans to put a tablet in every schoolchild's hands for the whole day.

As we have seen with the NSA, big data is a big topic and gets a lot of funding - yet officials there say they have no good ways of finding those needles of notable info once they collect the haystack of chatter. The education industry didn't get that message before anteing in but they can just go back to creating the old style books. Microsoft is close to turning a profit and has created an competitive piece of hardware which has not turned a profit yet (that I know of) and the company has no graceful way to slide out of the hardware market right now.

And those grant competitions? Billions of dollars were handed out which baited state and county school boards into spending increasing amounts of their budgets to keep up with the change in curriculum. Reports of boards being advised to buy stacks of books, only to have them go unused, can be found in every state which decided to chase the new standards. Many local school boards have been pretty sleepy, and some have been sleep-building expensive (and usually unnecessary) new school complexes. Their budgets are tight and teachers have been denied cost of living increases in a great many places.

That said, many parents are buying their children tablets, anyway, so if the state says each child needs a school tablet then who do you think would be made to buy them when the infrastructure to make schools able to use them is shriveling coffers?

With Common Core lying on the chopping block and all the other funding problems public and private education has, we can look at the picture with some more insight and try to figure out where Nadella will take the Surface - even if gradeschool education was not a goal in the first place.

-----------------------------



So what do I take from this? What compromises or design choices did MS make in the first models that are no longer there, now? RT is gone, for one. Such a constricted OS doesn't make much sense for an adult, but for a child...

------

P.S. Yes, I don't like the standards, myself. I tried to give information here, and not any more opinion than that I think the Common Core standards are going to be discarded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [A recent Reason TV video](http://youtu.be/n-zESacteu4?t=7m54s) broadly describes why a rendering plant would not open up in a residential area. A real example of a possible failure of this mechanism (as presently existing) would be the West, Texas, fertilizer plant explosion.

In places with or without zoning laws, is there a way to sue or take a civil proceeding with the intent of getting paid the negative difference in appraised property value? Is there a way to address a developer for a change in insurance premiums? Where can I find more information about this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> HEMA, Historical European Martial Arts, is the study and practice of the ways of war and duels from Western culture.

Free for spectators, Longpoint is a HEMA tournament taking place at Turf Valley Resort near Ellicott City, MD. The pools of competitors have been whittled at for two days already - come and see the best of the best.

Watch talented men and women compete with synthetic and steel longswords, messers (a single-handed sword), single-stick (literally a rattan stick - fun and people wear little armor), and do cuttings (technique display with sharp swords).

I'm helping staff tables, but have trained in longsword. This is an amazing activity. We get into padded armor (not like sumo suits, think fencing) and the scoring system benefits those who can make a hit without getting hit back and those who completely control the exchange. You will see fast sword work, suspenseful moments, and skilled throws. You will also see tanks whose blows are terrifying and ladies who can take on any challengers.

**Events begin at 9am in the grand ballroom. Finals start at 5pm and run to 8pm. Don't be afraid to ask around when you come!**

PM me for info on finding me if you seriously plan to come and would like to find me so I can explain stuff. Probably won't be staffing the finals.

Responsible children welcome. There are swords sticking out of gear bags everywhere on the floor and this is a pretty small crowd so please do not bring wildlings or screamers. Bring some water and snacks. I'd suggest sixth grade as the youngest spectator. The rings are roped off and you are in good company, there are engineers and policemen and veterans doing this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Challenging the Concept of Registering a Ship With a Nation. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-05 20:27:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why bother with flags of convenience? The information and assurances ports want guaranteed by a nation can be guaranteed in other ways.

I searched to see if this has been talked about here, and didn't see anything. Just had a thought and busted this out to talk about is and share.

TL;DR Steps  
1. Fly the black and gold to represent a ship as not registered with a nation.  
2. Use the internet or private resources to .  
3. ???? (Make trades and produce to enrich yourself through the market)  
4. Profit!

Is there a *need* for this? Maybe not a dire current need, but there is certainly a desire to remove one's property from the liability of registering to a state. Flags of convenience may not always be available so planning them away is prudent, profitable, and interesting.

##[Excerpt: *A GUIDE TO SHIP REGISTRATION* by the Government of New Zealand](http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Commercial-operations/Ship-registration/A-guide-to-Ship-Registration.pdf)

 The registration of ships is a time-honoured practice. It began principally as a means of controlling ships entitled to carry 
cargoes within the seaborne empires of Europe. In more recent times, however, **it has proved a convenient means of 
establishing title to the property in a vessel** - in other words, who owns it. At the same time, **registration has served to 
determine which country's law governs the operation of a ship and the behaviour of those onboard** - key concepts which 
today play an important part in the international law of the sea. 
 
 Basically, **registration confers nationality on a ship and brings it within the jurisdiction of the law of the flag state**. Thus, a New 
Zealand registered ship is bound by New Zealand law - both its shipping and other applicable provisions - though the vessel 
may venture well outside the territorial limits of New Zealand. **A New Zealand ship abroad is accorded the protection of the 
Government of New Zealand**, much as a New Zealand citizen is while travelling overseas. **A vessel's bona fides are established 
by its registration papers** just as a passport establishes them for a person. **Registration may also determine criminal jurisdiction 
in the event of any incident or accident in international waters.**
 
 Further, registration facilitates financial dealings in ships - their sale and purchase and the raising of mortgages - and **brings 
back to the owner responsibility for any liabilities incurred**. It does so by evidencing title to a ship and thus declaring to all the 
world who owns a particular vessel.

 Emphasis mine.

Flying a flag of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Cayman Islands, North Korea, Georgia, Honduras, Lebanon, Malta, Mongolia, Panama, and Saint Vincent or the Grenadines is not going to afford the ship much protection in fact, flying these [makes you a target for inspection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Port_state_targeting)


* We live in the age of information. Independent ships can list themselves openly on the internet through a self-hosted internet site (which companies can glean and aggregate information from) or use a beacon to broadcast the relevant information locally.

* If states [want to impose regulations on ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Environmental_effects), there are solutions. Ships can be registered into standards associations and companies.

* The ancap flag does not resemble any of the [International maritime signal flags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags), but I have not checked all of admiralty.

Just like bitcoin and other innovations in the realm of decentralization - there needs to be options for systems and applications. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  Nearly 2/3 of all recent education graduates in Ontario are unemployed or underemployed the following year. British Columbia certifies nearly 3 times the number of teachers it needs each year. Even fast growing Alberta has seen many of its school boards laying off teachers in recent years.


 The question of what is a fair salary and remuneration package for public school teachers is a difficult one. I dont have an answer for it either. I do know that the masses of unemployed recent teaching graduates implies that the total remuneration package for teachers is above the market-clearing level. Schools do not want to hire more teachers because they cannot afford them. Incidentally this is one reason why the teachers union and school administrators cannot meet eye-to-eye on the issue of class sizes. Teachers want smaller classes, but administrators cannot afford to hire the number of teachers necessary for this at the current remuneration packages.

 These fresh graduates  bright eyed and bushy tailed  want to make a difference in a childs life. They cannot find work because of a union that has negotiated wages above the market clearing level.

  Let unemployed teachers replace unionized ones during a strike at a wage rate they negotiate with school administrators. If the teachers on strike are worth the money and conditions they demand, the school administration will be all too happy to reach a settlement with them to get them back in their class. And if not? In that case wed have a pretty strong signal that the remuneration package they received in the past was too generous.

<TITLE> Zotloeterer VS Kourispower </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-29 21:08:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/

http://www.kourispower.com/

The Zotloeterer Turbine system and Kourispower system appear very similar, and I want to introduce you to them and explain the differences. **This is interesting because Kouris' original and only patents are different from what he is trying to sell now.** This is a personal and unprofessional work, and I have no connection or contact with either group aside from possibly sending an email to the Zotloeterer group a decade ago.

* A [vortex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex) forms when fluid rotates around an axis. Both system uses an outlet positioned to enable a vortex.

* The differences in systems come from how the water is coerced into forming a vortex and how power is generated. I will use "paddle" to refer to the exposed turbine of the Zotloeterer design and "turbine" for the submerged turbine of the original Kouris design. It seems "impeller" is a misnomer for a turbine in-line with the flow of water and filling the cross-section of a pipe.

##The Point

The installation called the Marysville Pilot Power Plant in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwqwLoc93ZI) and [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPIWSVhVHL0) is *not* the Kouris patented design. It does not primarily utilize the power generation feature detailed in the patent documents. Nothing you can see but the pipes and dam resemble the patented work. It uses a paddle and generator resembling the Zotloeterer design. Kouris says there is an impeller in the outlet pipe, as well, but obfuscates the matter. He concedes the impeller is a failed idea, but **I conclude** he keeps it to maintain a semblance of patent control.

Kouris also has a [two-episode feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxxHdOmHEes list=PLD3902BBECFFF27CF) on Youtube. If you look at the patent and press release dates from Zotloeterer and then watch this, you can see a little problem. I don't know the guy, but I'd say Kouris is a liar. He uses poor terminology and doesn't have a scientific explanation that makes sense. All his language evades resembling the Zotloeterer system. That's sad, because the technology is good and admitting he doesn't have a patent isn't the worst thing in the world (unless he has a big ego that doesn't let him). Because Kouris has an inspirational origin story for the turbine design, but not the paddle design, I think it is safe to say he discovered Zotloeterer designs and copied the core concept.

Kouris says in the video his vortex uses the power of centripetal force but evades saying "gravity" and his brochure says ["operated using the kinetic energy created by the earth's rotation"](http://www.kourispower.com/wp-content/uploads/brochure20.jpg). The Zotloeterer Turbine is marketed as using "gravitational force," which it does (both do). Water falls because of gravity, a vortex just makes it also move horizontally on the way down. Unless Kouris thinks that the earth's spin pushes water out of springs and makes rain fall (both wrong), it sounds like he thinks vortexes form because the earth spins (very wrong).

Look at [this mock up of Kouris' original, patented, design](http://youtu.be/QZSq3alBS_o?t=9m45s) versus [this Zotloeterer concept](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/Fliessgewaesserstrukturen-2011.jpg?1391875144099). I saw the in-line concept in 2003 in high school - about when Kouris modified his plans. In that clip, Kouris is talking about the new design *with the old, discarded one onscreen.*

In the rest of this post, we can see all the reasons why Kouris left the old design behind.

##Structures

The *patented* Kourispower system exists freestanding in the middle of any standing water - generally a dam. A pipe outlet runs from a few feet under the surface of the water, straight down, and then out the bottom of the dam. A vortex forms as water is able to approach the outlet from every surface direction. [image](http://imgur.com/8tPZs7c)

The Zotloeterer system basin is located to the side of a stream with weirs. Water enters through an off-center inlet and exits by falling out the bottom through a central hole outlet. A vortex forms above the outlet through the assistance of the off-center inlet; this enables the basin to be placed out of the immediate path of the flowing water. [image](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/ground-map-GWVPP-2012_1.jpg?1391874738397) / [image](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/bio-reactor-GWVPP-2012.jpg?1391875380890)

I realize the distinction may not be clear. Consider the placement and benefits of each system. Zotloeterer turbines are *to the side* of a *flowing water*. They are part of a living stream or river. Kourispower turbines are placed *in the middle* of *standing, dammed water*. They are scantly different from the internals of the Hoover Dam... except now there is a cool (and kinda dangerous) vortex! WOO STRAYA!

##Power Generation

Zotloeterer systems normally use a paddle on a shaft hanging below a generator as the power generation feature. Since there is only one axle, there is less to break and less to make. The generator is suspended above the basin with the paddle over the outlet, so it is spun by the vortex. Recent patent documents describe a feature which places the generator *in the paddle*. This makes it so that it is not an axle, but a pipe with a wire, that is lowered into the vortex. The paddle-generator appears small and fit for third-world applications where simplicity and being self-contained is traded for power production.

The Kourispower system patent details placing a turbine into the outlet pipe. The vortex does not drive the feature; the vortex was thought to increase the flow past the turbine compared to simply having a submerged pipe. This is similar to a traditional hydroelectric dam operation, but was intended to increase the flow enough that the system can generate relevant amount of power at smaller scales. The flow is not faster, and the turbine experiences less efficiency.

##Watts

 GWVPPs are hydro power plants for low head from 0,7 up to 2m and for a flow rate from 0,05 up to 20m/s and for a power range from 0,5 up to 160kW.

##Pros and Cons

|Kourispower|Zotloeterer|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Creates open vortex on surface of standing water|Vortex is contained in concrete basin|
|Requires fish ladders/ minces fish that go through turbine|Fish are proven to be safe to traverse basin and weirs|
|Requires dam to create still water for stable vortex in addition to head|Requires only head, usually from weirs|
|Problematic to screen from debris without interrupting vortex|Vortex can take small debris, large debris screen is before inlet|
|Susceptible to debris clogging|Flush gate can be operated to clear screen for large debris|
|Maintenance requires draining dam to below outlet|Inlet can be closed for work, moving parts above water|

##Patents

Both groups list where they are patented [K](http://www.kourispower.com/about/) / [Z](http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/gravitation-water-vortex-power-plants/patents/), but Zotloeterer goes a step above and has most of what you need to recreate their design posted, published, or in the patents. This is always useful for dreaming, scheming, or if they don't return your emails. I think patents are a little frivolous and prevent people from freely improving on other's work, but I don't think that is a discussion for this sub.

I had fun writing and formatting this, and I hope you enjoy it [and the formatting](http://reddittext.com/).

<TEXT> GISD: [Pyrus calleryana (tree)](http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1389 fr=1 sts=sss lang=EN)

[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callery_Pear)

[image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Bradford_9288.JPG)

I have observed this up close, and on a macro-environmental scale.

Our driveway has ten of these trees lining it, in northern MD (my father refuses to cut them down, so we killed saplings). The seedlings are thick, robust, and fill in unmowed and untilled ground. The young tree is thorny and sturdy. Maximum size will never be out of hand, as Callery Pears rarely grow past 30ft and the trunk will rarely pass 1.25ft diameter. Each year generates a great deal of seeds, enough to plant an acre at full maturity. I rarely see them eaten, though, so I think spread is mostly accidental and by treefall.

As with many large invasive species, these trees were prized for beautification qualities and introduced commercially.

The unmowed right-of-ways of Maryland are chock full of Callery Pears. Growing up in MD, I have noticed the spread of wild invasive growth from Montgomery County, through Howard and Baltimore Counties, and into Frederick and Carroll Counties. I have seen a right-of-way filled up to a 12ft wall of thorns in less than four years.

Easy to girdle, pull up, and kill in general. Even easy to find, because they flower brilliant white and before any other tree on the East Coast (I think)! The problem/focus with extermination lies with gaining the cooperation of nurseries, developers, and homeowners to remove existing trees and remove them from stock. I don't believe in bans, all that is needed is awareness and the appropriate creation of externality precedent. That means if you plant a new tree or refuse to cut an existing one down, you can be brought to court for restitution per seedling on another person's property (including the state right-of-ways).

The state of MD is not doing anything, that I know of. I have considered calling the DNR to ask what's up, but have not. I just found this sub from /r/permaculture and wanted to post. Any more info would be helpful, especially as to efforts and the status of other affected areas.

edit: Good news! kinda. Bad news first. We cut down a big white pine last year at the end of a row. This year a thousand pears are sprouting in it's shadow. Good news second. My dad conceded we probably should have cut those mature pears lining our driveway down - and we will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/25356747/drug-debate-will-punishing-women-who-take-drugs-while-pregnant-help-hurt-or-both

Will the women doing this be feeling the pain from paying any medical bills for premature births or disorders? Making penalties explicit for harming the unborn will increase demand for abortions before it ushers responsibility for actions into the minds of men and women engaging in intercourse.

Is it a worse thing to place poor mothers in jail and string newborns and maybe siblings into state care? Possibly. And I don't want to give the state the power to do so, because it will undoubtedly be unjustly dealt to some poor family.

If affected women cannot free themselves from a drug addiction, why can we expect them to disengage from one of the more basic and powerful temptations? This law does not improve anything. Might doesn't make right in treating moral laxity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I say put your money where your mouth is, personally.

Sometimes putting your mouth somewhere is good enough, but usually not.

Just like charity, if you want something done you are better off doing it yourself (or as close to that as possible).

Recently, the Obama administration formed ties in Syria with groups classified as terrorists just across some imaginary lines in the sand. The homework was done, and the report was on the desk, but they made a decision well removed from what any of us would see as rational. We agree a state should not meddle abroad.

I think if an an-cap decided to do something it could be summed up like this:

* Individuals would know of the intentions of foreigners like we would know of any other person's through reputation and trusted sources.

* Individuals would support them like we would support anyone else. Personal financial support. Personal physical support. Organized financial support. Organized physical support. (this includes red-cross type groups, non-violent protest groups, violent protest groups, and militias/privateers/private armies)

If there isn't a state to prevent militias (etc.) from forming. Then there is no state to prevent militias (etc.) or individuals from going abroad.

So there are two questions.

1. How would you support a cause such as the Ukrainian riots, if at all, and how would you know whom to help?

2. Does that help ever introduce externalities upon your neighbors and region? (esp. in the case of organized physical support - militias, etc.) </TEXT>

Is it fair to say that it is impossible for a human to be competent at any secretary-level position (or higher) in a modern world government?

American presidents and various prime ministers have been eking through terms by lying through their teeth and their direct underlings [get burnt out from trying to do their jobs, fired for failing to do their jobs, or keep their jobs by lying and shirking responsibility - then evading the consequences of that.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/locked-in-the-cabinet-99374.html#.UwNsoPldWrg)

**Can we start making the argument that no person can effectively hold any position in a government this large, with so many powers?** There are not enough secretaries to receive all the information and too many secretaries for the executive to be briefed by them all. Are all modern world powers effectively structured anarchy (with a side of secretary-level oligarchy)? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [This is super-speed video of the battle.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2zWWg7-Y6o)

When I ask"would this space battle ever happen," I mean to ask that in any case. EVE Online has a few special considerations which are unique and give reason to a few things. I only played a 14-day trial so not everything here may be perfect.

* No permadeath. Everyone is playing a person that is basically immortal and lives through clones. Every time your clone dies, the memories are all saved in your original so they pop out a new one and off you go.

* Sectors have security levels. Super-mega governments/civilizations enforce different levels of security in the different sectors. Some sectors are outside any NPC security. There is fighting in between these that players participate in, but there are also fights between player alliances - which this is. 

This battle, B-R5RB, was for player alliance control of a station located somewhere else. Two player alliances agreed to fight out control in this 0 security sector so no civilization would interfere - thus limiting or entirely removing NPC combatants and any consequences fighting in a secure sector have.

* All armaments are automatic. You pick a target for your ship or individual turrets/lasers/drones/missile racks and pilot the ship so the arms have the target in range of fire.

* Warp navigation. You navigate by engines inside sectors and between sectors by warp. Traveling between sectors is kind of like taking a train. No stops in between and not all sectors connect to every other sector. Some ships (notably the biggest ones) can group warp ships around them to arrive at the same time, in the same place.

Certainly all of these are imaginable, and all are futuristic - but are they realistic? Is the result, seen in the video, realistic? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is this concept found already in any works?

I thought it up last night and am not well read, yet. Plenty of videos and thought under my lid, but I can't read at work.

In any case, this certainly explains how people see this thing called "government" which belongs to "everybody." With no owner (a government could only be "owned" by a sort of autocrat - not the worst thing if he's wise, but all men are fallible and nobody is fit to "rule" especially not in a permanent sense), each person who understands the the common nature of government will attempt to get the most profit out of it, ASAP. The profit comes at the expense of other's liberty - obviously abhorrent to us. But any effort to use and not dismantle this power structure, each user of the government indicates his rejection or ignorance of personal liberty. The former should be ashamed and the second admonished. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Found this story](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/12/the-vast-majority-of-raw-data-from-old-scientific-studies-may-now-be-missing/#.UrPOyrx5sRg.reddit) on /r/PhilosophyofScience

Not a pure science question, but certainly up for discussion.

 When a group of researchers tried to email the authors of 516 biological studies published between 1991 and 2011 and ask for the raw data, they were dismayed to find that more 90 percent of the oldest data (from papers written more than 20 years ago) were inaccessible. In total, even including papers published as recently as 2011, they were only able to track down the data for 23 percent.

 Whats the solution? Some journals... have adopted policies that require authors to submit raw data along with their papers, allowing the journal itself to archive the data in perpetuity. Although journals, like people, are susceptible to changing email addresses and technological obsolescence, these problems can be much more easily managed at the institutional scale.

So where is your raw data? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Invincible Corn Pudding (one dish) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-06 20:24:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Corn pudding is a good dish; easy to make. With a whole stick of butter it tastes pretty darn good. Bachelors! This takes a single dish to cook and refrigerates well in portions.

EDIT: [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/9HOpp)

*Time:* Leave butter out til soft. Prep takes ten minutes. Cooking takes an hour. Serve immediately.

*Recipe:*

* **1** [can whole corn (drain the liquid before using)](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Golden-Sweet-Whole-Kernel-Corn-15.25-Oz/10315427)

* **1** [can creamed corn](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Cream-Style-Sweet-Corn-14.75-oz/10448549)

* [**1** box corn muffin mix](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Jiffy-Corn-Muffin-Mix-8.5-Oz/10448133)

* **4** eggs

* **1/2** cup butter (1 standard American stick, I believe)

* **1/2** cup sour cream

Leave the butter out to soften on the counter, covered or in the wax wrap. This should be done long enough in advance to make sure it is pliable. Maybe a few hours. (If you don't do this, you won't be able to mix the butter in fully. Absolutely not a problem, the butter will melt and get in there just fine - but getting it to mix is the proper way.) Some people zap the butter in a microwave at the last second. If that is you plan, might I recommend placing the butter in the casserole dish? 

* Combine the ingredients in a 2 quart casserole dish (oven-safe dish). We us a round dish as high as it is wide. If your dish is glass, you can watch the butter bubble towards the end. I add the wet ingredients first and make sure they are well mixed, then the corn muffin mix, and then the butter.

* Bake at 350 degrees (ovens in US are in Fahrenheit) for 55-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.

* Serve hot, immediately is fine.

We have this every year at thanksgiving. I had to make it this year because everyone else was too busy with our 8 other vegetables and two turkeys. And candied yams. That means it was in the oven for 45 minutes too low, and then 30 minutes too high because other dishes were more important. Last year the sour cream stayed in small clumps and was not enough to make me not eat this. My grandmother was too busy and did not mix thoroughly. I call it invincible because it is very hard to mess up, especially to an inedible state.

*Original accompanying newspaper clipping from my New Jersey Grandmother's house:*

 Corn Pudding

 (ingredients)

 Combine all ingredients in a 2-quart casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees (F) for 55-60 minutes or until a knife comes out clean.

 Ruth T Nadolny of Hamilton says her family came upon this Corn Pudding recipe from an unexpected source.

   "Years ago my daughter Linda Burch took ka bus trip to Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay with her grandmother. When dining, they were served corn pudding, which they thought was delicious. My daughter ventured to ask for the recipe and, surprisingly, they gave it to her. It has been a family favorite for many years now."

I can say the same for my family, we enjoy this immensely next to our Thanksgiving celery salad, brussel sprouts, and succotash. Funnily enough the recipe came full circle when I got it from my grandmother, because I live in Maryland. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bill Nye's [open letter to Obama](http://youtu.be/XkWetbQHWlk) to divert more of NASA's budget to the Planetary Science Division needs this reply:

Showing that government is an able player in solving new, previously unseen, problems extends the delusion that government can centrally plan any part of human life more effectively than an individual or voluntary association.

I think NASA has done some wonderful work and solved some amazing problems with ingenious solutions, but private industry has begun to invest in space exploration. Private industry has invested in space sciences since the first communications satellites.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Excerpts from official statement:

This year's program will focus on privateers during the "Golden Age of Sail." Leave your eye patches and parrots at home, there will be no pirates or buried treasure here! However, visitors of all ages will be able to participate in authentic drills and exercises. You will learn about the weapons and tactics required for capturing or defending a sailing ship at sea.

 Guest instructors will include Mark P. Donnelly and Keystone Academy of Dueling and Swordsmanship. They will be assisted by Park Ranger Victor Markland and members of the Mid-Atlantic Society for Historical Swordsmanship.

[Here is the quoted Plan Your Event page for the park website.](http://www.nps.gov/hamp/planyourvisit/event-details.htm?eventID=498941-232573)

[This is the facebook page to RSVP on. An RSVP is not required.](https://www.facebook.com/events/526334984068570/)

I attended this event last year, the theme was more towards the gentlemanly sports. There were a few young attendees; plenty of adults. The Hampton historic site is quiet, beautiful, and well kept. Bring plenty of water, and a hat or sunscreen. If you want to visit at times other than the event, tours of the mansion and farm site's buildings are offered on FRIDAY, SATURDAY and SUNDAY ONLY from 10 am to 4 pm. Buildings are closed to the public Monday through Thursday. Grounds are open daily from 8:30 am to 5 pm.

<TEXT> I may have shut down my computer at the wrong time...

Dell Precision T1650

Computer out of box, added all the work software (adobe, bentley, Acad, deltek...), performed automatic updates twice, and restarted for extra freshness. Then, because I have to re-install autocad with a single license for the intended user, I uninstalled AutoCAD. It said Windows Explorer needed to be stopped to complete - don't worry, we'll restart it! (Yes, No, Reboot)

I said yes. Windows Explorer stopped, and the uninstall completed.

...

...

Where is my desktop?

I don't know what to do at this point, and figure a restart will fix it. I press the physical button, but never changed the option for "what does the power button do" So I think it tried to sleep. I mash the power button down for a hard reboot.
Give it a few... power on... Nothing. The box turns "on" and "off" swiftly, and no fans run. Monitor blank - tried using all display ports.

Keyboard lights up.

It does not run the recovery CD on insertion.

This is the hardest I have ever screwed a pc, how do I fix this mess?

HP DesignJet 500

You can tell the belt is going on these by all the little black rubber fluff on your prints. Two months later, the belt sprockets don't catch and you are supposed to have prints for a proposal tomorrow.

Don't know if I'm searching poorly or could use a trade tip, but I have not found *just a belt* for sale. Do parts only come in kits? Is there a place to go to find more cannibalized parts?

112th Congress

2d Session

H. CON. RES. 107

Expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes **an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor** under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. JONES submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that, except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

<DATE> 2013-06-17 17:29:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am working on a business plan for a service which requires a digital product. My field is drafting/modelling - not coding. This service will help designers and companies share, render, and advertise their built environments in a realistic city setting. So far, I have narrowed possibilities for creating the city to Unity3D with C#.

The digital product I require needs basic realistic graphics, an update-able city-sized map, and multi-platform availability (for read-only interaction)

The city buildings might be procedurally rendered, I think its called, where the buildings are all distributed by an algorithm, and seed numbers can be saved to keep the layout the same.

I need to know if creating this product is feasible with Unity3D. Tell me what other info you need to give me an answer. **Even if you cannot give me the answer yourself, expanding the criteria I need to gather is important.** Suggesting other communities to ask in is also a big help. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do the shortages detailed in this article affect mass-production of Soylent? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-28 17:00:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/children-are-dying/

This article has been posted in other subreddits. This issue may only apply to US residents.

As far as I can tell:
American hospitals subscribe to GPOs to keep prices low. There are less than ten companies making 80% of US supply on vintage production lines. The US bars import of foreign supplies for use in health care (?). The FDA found real problems with the US products and told producers to shut down lines to fix the problems. A shortage ensued because no producer knows the capabilities of any other and no hospital knows how much every other hospital has. Nobody knows when more will be available. Nobody wants to tell anybody else about the problem for fear of public reprisal.

We can talk politics elsewhere, but I thought these questions should be addressed before a problem arises. These are questions that may appear if both Soylent and the shortage get press coverage at the same time, and may be sensational or blunt. I encourage you to share any other ideas and questions!

* Are the short chemicals and providers the same as the ones used for the Soylent formula?

* Can Americans acquire and use foreign products?

* Does buying supply kill babies? (sensational *and* blunt)

* Does increasing demand out of health care help incentivize producers to increase production more rapidly and modernize production? </TEXT>

1. We are stewards of the earth. 
2. Extramarital intercourse is probably empty. 
3. The classics are always good to read. 
4. Preserve innocent life. 
5. Trust but verify. 
6. Trust welcomes trust. 
7. Marital intercourse is wholesome. 
8. "Its only a machine. I am the weapon." Gun Rights. 
9. Never give up fighting for freedom, or die trying. 
10. Have no false idols. 

I just saw this movie yesterday, and can recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction, action /adventure, or investigation of humanity... Even if you don't care for Tom Cruise. The soundtrack is good. The cinematic are beautiful. The acting is spectacular. The story will be familiar, but has never been put together in this way, with this quality.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am not gamedev of any sort, but have an product idea and need to know if it will work - this will help me work on the business proposal for the service which would use the product. Thanks for helping.

This product is a medium sized city filled with default buildings, rendered in realism, in which users can submit buildings to be replaced with personally made models. It should be accessible on a web browser without installing an application to the computer and be accessible through a mobile application. In the best case, a link in a webpage or email can send you to a specific address in the city. The focus is on the models, not interaction. In this way, it would resemble a changeable Epic Citadel demo on a city-wide scale.

Do you expect this will be possible with UE4?
Will the map be too large, and loading times too great? This isn't procedurally generated.

It looks like my only other option for would be Webgl... and it is a bit primordial. But please enlighten me to my other options; none I remember is powerful enough for the level of graphics I need.

**tl;dr** What if I made an epic city (think looks like epic citadel), where you could put your buildings in, then everyone could go look at them on mobile and in-browser. Could I do it on UE4? </TEXT>

The digital product is a realistically rendered city. I must be able to update the map and link to locations via hyperlink in browser. It should be accessible from as many devices as possible, with mobile being a choice possibility.
What I need to know is if any game engines out there would work, or if it needs a fresh engine? Unreal engine 4 is cross platform and powerful, but I need to be able to direct people to distinct locations from a link outside the application.

Is this where to start ? Also I'm near Baltimore if you want a chat.
Advice is appreciated. So are criticisms and corrections ;] I haven't told you what the service based on the product will be on purpose.
I dunno if it will say below, but this is cross posted /r/gamedev, /r/inat, and /r/gamedevclassifieds </TEXT>

<TITLE> Biometrics Constitutional Amendment </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-04-11 13:26:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With a New propensity for governments to use biometrics to collect our data and verify our identity, I think at least here in the United States of America a constitutional amendment is needed to control this resource. Immediate and reliable identification processes can be used to catalog and corral people like cattle,especially during the implementation of martial law.
I propose that a two-thirds supermajority of both houses of congress would be necessary to expand the use of biometrics in federal jurisdiction.
This popped into my head this morning and I thought I should post it. </TEXT>
