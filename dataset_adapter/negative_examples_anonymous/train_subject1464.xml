Your input was invaluable, so I am hoping that here, in round 2, you can all assist me again. Link is in comments so as to not be considered advertising.

<TEXT> That actually made me LOL, MOOON! 
Maybe that's why I should have tied into it more, or even just change the title to MOON! 

However, this story has been around since before Twilight, and the moon is tied in, hence the show. Is it vital on the cover? Nope.

I am more interested in what you are trying to say with Show, don't tell. When as a cover, it's all show? That's where I am running into problems, how can I use a cover to say the words I want said. With no words. Perhaps I should turn the world on it's heels and put my synopsis on the front and back, with only a faded image in the background... </TEXT>

"Can evil be defeated, or does it merely transform?


Donovan is evil.


He knows it.


He doesn't care.

When an unprecedented solar flare ruins the earth, it changes all humanity, turns back the clock to days long gone, and gives Donovan the power to do almost anything he wants.

That is, as long as he can get rid of his sister.

After all, she has the same power he does.

I will place a few photos in the comments to show the general outlay. 

TL:DR Glass needs to go in, how can I hold it without making it look like crap? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just ordered my GTX970 (finally saved enough money for it) and within 24h they cancelled my order. Claimed there was a problem with my shipping address. (Used it for 3 years, paypal and ebay confirmed) and that I may be charged the full amount from my bank regardless. But I shouldn't worry, the money will be refunded in up to 5 business days. So they say. 

SO! Now I can't even buy another card since I have to wait a full 5 days to make sure the bank doesn't withdraw the funds for a card I am not going to get and put me in an overdrawn state.

I just beat my head against my firewall for 30 minutes with their customer support, but they just kept copy/pasting the same cookie cutter responses. I have had more intelligent conversations with a bot...

I am not too happy with NewEgg right now. To say the least.

So am I alone? Or has anyone else been treated like this from these guys.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not much to go on, but here is the first description of Dario Fisher from Mirror Thief. 

"For the longest time I simply just stared at the reflection in the mirror. The lines were still there. The brown eyes still had the light inside of them, I could see the signs of healing, although it looked like hell, it must have been worse before. My hair had been cut, poorly, it wasn't a style I would have chosen myself, yet I guess it was better than what it could have been if left to grow out. My face showed only the slightest bit of a scruff growing in. I didn't normally let my beard grow out, but I could see the advantage of not having a close shave at this point of a healing process. I noted with some regret that my goatee had been trimmed off. Ah well, it would grow back if I let it."

He has just awoken inside a hospital after a motorcycle accident. White male about 18 years old. I would like to see what image this little bit brings to your mind... </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a company that makes aftermarket heater setups for older vehicles that never came with any heat. It wasn't a factory fit, but it did supply heat from the coolant lines much like todays vehicles. I believe they used to be a couple hundred dollars. I don't have the places name handy, but I know a guy that will be at work tomorrow who does. Since you mentioned you are in Canada as well I can get the toll free number to his work for you, see if he can dig up a name from his old memory.

<TEXT> In the infancy of the internet I thought I had fallen in love. It turned out to be a joke played on me by a woman that had her own heart broken by another. She couldn't hurt him, so she decided to hurt someone else the same way she had been hurt.

I learned from that mistake myself and have regularly found others falling for similar traps, and sometimes helped them see it for themselves. Other times, I am happy to say, it wasn't fake.

I have even thought I should be writing a book about it. At least my experiences anyway.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amazon ranks free books different than paid. You might even hit #1 in your promo (I have at least twice) but the minute it's over your title drops off the face of the internet.

Even price structure changes where you sit in rank catagories. 

Amazon isn't willing to help indies any more than a big traditional publisher. The best way to get your work in front of people is to write the next book. Then, the next one...and one more after that. </TEXT>

For my wife, it was a childhood of belittlement and trauma that she is still working to get over even at 30 years old. 

Some will say you were blessed with this, others say how sorry they feel for you.

All I can say is, when you get the chance to be a parent yourself, just be there for your kids. It's more important than any of the toys or privileges out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While not a turn based game, I found what I had been missing (and I think you too) when I started playing the Demon Souls/Dark Souls games. They are real time, but the...hard play style brought back the fun. 

Now, if that isn't your taste, there are still turn based games out there in RPG format.

XCOM for instance. Not a classic RPG but still a hell of a game, in all its forms. 

And for the life of me, I remember seeing a new game coming out very soon that is all turn based combat in an RPG form, but the name has left me! 

I am sure another Redditor will remember it and add it here...or I will in an edit once I can stimulate my fogged brain.  </TEXT>

Only other advice I could give is, if it's an older tube style TV, they didn't take to temperature changes well. (Sometimes) So if you left them sit to come around to room temperature they would often start working normally again.

Hell No.

How about this...let me actually control MY OWN PRICES! Let me sell a book for .25 and make .24 in profit. Instead of 2.99 and getting .72c of it. 

You are forcing us to make our books stupidly expensive just to make a buck.

Give us authors a chance to control our work and maybe we will be more willing to help fight one of your battles. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was a long time ago and I only remember a few things...

-It was about 2 guys who tried to climb a mountain? (I think)

- I think one of them died while climbing and the other went into depression.

-He ended up living in an old train car at a ski hill?

-There was of course a woman mixed in here.

-I believe in the end he decided to climb the mountain in honor of his friend. (Not sure)

Sorry it's not much. What I can say so far is that it's not K2, but is from around that era. I have googled extensively, but have come up empty...

Maybe the Reddit hive mind will have better luck?

Thanks in advance!

These have just been re-published, what were the old covers like?

You decided to comment on reviews, even as going as far as calling a reader the grammar police...how is that not biting you in the backside?

I wanted to hate you, but I can't. If you really are making the money you say, it's a jealous problem on my end. I like your latest covers. Simple but nice. Not my tastes, but then again that's why they are my tastes.

It's nice to know a fellow Canadian, and neighbour, can do so well as an indie.

<DATE> 2014-06-10 19:03:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Punched a hole through my transmission last week. So far I am looking at over 2k to have it fixed. Both my kids inherited my wife's jaw problems, we have decided to fix it now while they are young, than wait till they are teens and spend 10x as much. My work, same job for over 20 years, was just hit with a major loss as our CEO and friend passed away. This has shaken the company pretty hard. 

Yep, what's next? I ask myself that too.

So off the top I want you to know, I am not looking for money, at least not directly. I have no problem with earning my money. 
I work hard, but it's tough, you all know it's tough. So I am asking for a trade.

I write books. And I have them available in e-book and paperback. I am hoping that even a few of you might be interested in what I write. It's not a perfect solution, but every sale I make helps out in the future. 

I have seen the power of Reddit do awesome things.

Thanks for your time, and the link to my work will be in the comments. </TEXT>

I wouldn't mind hearing your take on it. 


His parents ignore him.

His motorcycle is trashed from the accident.

He has nowhere to sleep, no money left, and no job to earn more.

With few options open to him, Dario's future is dark, and depression is sneaking around the frame of his world. That is until his fingers push through the boundary of the reflection in front of him, and he learns that he can move through a world that others can only see.

Now...can he use this to fix the errors of his past, or will crime be the only option? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am an author. I don't hide it, and I don't lie about it. 

Sometimes I have free giveaways. And in all honesty, they are for self promotion. Why else would an author give up his/her work for free?

Readers. Authors need readers. 

I understand the strong feelings Reddit has against advertisers, so I do my best to keep my promo's to the correct subreddits. 

Regardless, on one of my promo's a few months back I used Reddit as well as other forms of promotion (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and pretty much any place I could post a link) and a certain Redditer didn't care for the use of a forum they seemed to take as their own personal playground. I have been following this persons comments for the last while looking for some kind of shred of decency, a glimmer of hope for the spark of humanity, but I haven't seen it. I had hoped they were having a bad day and I just happened to be the recipient of that. However, in light of their comments since my turn in their spotlight, I just don't see it.

So, they downloaded my free work, created a profile on Amazon, and promptly tried to give all my books a 1 star rating.

They got away with one. At which point a few of my readers decided they didn't want this person to get away scott free and sent out letters to Amazon asking for it to be removed.

In the end it wasn't taken down, but it was downvoted enough to no longer matter as much. But the stir created by my readers was enough to spike my book up into some higher rankings for a while, and that got me a little more notice.

So, their attempt at a personal strike, even though it hurt, (Authors do care about how people take their work. We all want to please everyone, even if it isn't possible.) turned out to be a good thing for a little while. 

My reader list spiked. I sold a few dozen more works than I normally do, and I gained a small amount of money in my bank account. Perhaps the trend will continue, even though I see the ripples fading even now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You. Yes you, the redditer who claims to be "Helping". You used the information I provided for free. You struck out at me in real life and tried to sabotage my work. 

You are a prick.

But because of your actions, I have had the best two months in book sales in a long time. No, I'm not going to be famous any time soon. No I am not going to be rich. But for the next two months I have little more disposable cash in my wallet and it's partly due to your attempt at petty revenge. All because I don't agree with what you say. 

Your hipster wanna be, pot smoking, old before your time, old people watching self can try to hide in the darkness of the internet if it makes you happy.

I see you.

I know that you tried writing, and failed. I can see it in your typing, I can see it in your responses. You have an education and it shows. 

Shame you never grew up.

So again. Thanks. Your little attack had a good outcome. I hope one day you can realize how you actually did help, even though your intent was to harm.

Right of the bat, look how many words start with "f" try reading that fast...I had to untie my tounge. 

Be sure to read what you write out loud. If you are like me, and know the words by heart, read the sentences normally, but backwards. Last sentence first and so on.

You will soon find some of our errors and sentences that don't flow.

Hope this helps some. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have found, so far, every dollar spent for advertising is a wasted dollar. Unless! It is on personal advertising. And by that I mean heading out and printing posters, setting up book signings, the things along those lines are your best bets.

After almost 4 years in self publishing I am just starting to see a monthly income of about 100 dollars. And that is with 3 full titles under my belt and a couple collections of short stories. 

In short, the more you put into your work, the more you will get out. For me, my family and personal life come before my writing, so it is taking a much longer time to build a reader base. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Getting it available is easy.
Getting it read is hard.

I have been on the top 100 lists a dozen times and I am an unknown name. I can create spikes in sales with a good stint of advertising, but they always fade after a couple of days. If you think of your writing as a business, that will help. 

But whatever you do, don't quit your day job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very well said. 

As it sits my numbers are so low a single theft stands out. Of course my loss of .25c isn't going to break the bank any time soon, nor will it send me into the depths of dispair. (Pit of Dispair?) 

It's more of the stance of a simple theft. Not many other areas of life allow others to simply take something and people shrug and say, ah well, perhaps others might pay me. 

Sadly the more authors that simply shrug it off and move on, will only make it harder for others to stand and say, "I'm not okay with it."

If perhaps one day if I am big enough in the literary world that I know longer notice a single theft my stance might chance. I will have to wait and see. </TEXT>

I don't know how many people I have known that just play an instrument to play it. If you have the equipment, slap on some headphones, crank up a tune you like and start drumming.

If you aren't happy with the 'you' that you are, it might be time for something new. Step out of your comfort zone once in a while, and don't be afraid to fail. Actually, some of the best times I have had are when I was epically failing at something.

In the end the sun will come up in the east and go down in the west and you will have another chance to try something else. Even if you aren't any good at it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone is a bad writer.

To someone.

Hell, there is a redditor that went out of his way to DL one of my free works just so he could leave me a terrible review. Just for spite. 

Does that make me a bad writer? Of course not. It just shows the point that no matter what you write, someone is going to not like it. 

Take any one of Kings work for instance, and pull up the one star reviews on Amazon. I will bet you an e-book that he has dozens of them. 

Thing is you really can't tell if you are a bad, good, or great writer until you have written something. Then written something else, and something else. 

So get to writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What this post doesn't say is that sometimes you are not offered the choice of a pill at all. You are stuck outside the rabbit hole and there is no way to see how far it goes. 

That's when you have no choice but to stand on a street corner, hold your own work in the air and say to the world, "Am I good enough?" 

Even though the act of doing so will open the flood gates to those who will shoot you down, unplug you from a distance, just because they can. </TEXT>

I have had works in brick and mortar stores, yet unless I was there to suggest them to others, they normally sat dormant. 

I have spoken with many agents and the norm is for every 5000 applicants, one is chosen. Many great works will go unknown because of a simple typo on page 34. The selection process is that picky.  </TEXT>

It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.


One.


The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.


Two.


His arms stretched out, the magic building around him forming a bubble in time.


Three.


The scene of a potential deadly future burned themselves into his memory, even with eyes closed against them.


Four.


In an instant, a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.


Five.

<TEXT> Yes, your training as an industrial electriction obviously makes you an expert at singing.

At least in my first post I admitted I can't sing. Never once said I was an expert. All I say is that when you sing a word and you miss the last letter, it sounds off. 

She sings great. I noticed she missed the last letters often. If I notice, odds are others will. But I forget I am dealing with an expert in the field so I humbly step down. </TEXT>

It started with science, and ended the earth.


Aiden and Jess thought they were only doing experiments with light. They had no idea what would happen when they broke the speed of light while bouncing a laser off the moon. 


Using jumps through time Aiden tried to fix what he broke and save humanity, only to draw others into his ruined future. Each jumped pulled another victim caught in Aiden's bubbles of time.


Jane, her life of torment driving her to suicide.

Casey, an adventure seeker, living life for the thrills.

Francis, always on the run, fire her closest friend.

And Aiden's girlfriend Jess, the reason for him to continue trying even after humanity turns against him.


In this, the finale of the Past Jumper series we find out if Aiden can break out of his cycle, or will the worlds become forever unbound.

It was a good feeling for a time. As Christmas got closer I forgot I had signed up, until later and I noticed I had never gotten an address, a name, anything.

I know I got a confirmation when I signed up, but nothing came for me to send to. 

I am disappointed, I really wanted to put a smile on some strangers face, yet for some reason that I don't know, I wasn't allowed.

I find myself angry, yet I can't explain why. I shouldn't be. I have no reason to be. I just am. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a strange experience. The minute the helicopter lifted off and left me behind, the entire island went silent.


I could still see the mainland from where I was left on the beach. The white sand disappeared into the starlight blue of the ocean. They told me before they left I shouldn't try swimming for it. I might make it a few hundred feet before the sharks got me. Almost at command, I watched a fin break the surface a moment before silently dipping back below to the depths. With a gulp, I turned back towards my goal, my future, my death.


The sands stretched out in front of me to the line of trees that seemed impenetrable. This was insane, yet given the options it was the only choice I could take.


In a moment of clarity, I remembered the magistrate standing above me as he passed sentence.


"You have been given the black ticket. For your crimes, you have the choice of a swift death now, or the opportunity to earn your freedom on exclusion."
"Exclusion."
I had stammered the word before I could think about what I was agreeing to.


Now I was left to fight against the islands turmoil of genetically modified animals, and twist one into submission, or die trying.


The simple blade they had supplied me with felt heavy in my hands as I willed my feet to move me to the tree line. It wasn't a choice. Death was rumored to live at every bend on this island. The animals here were the remnants of the gene splicing experiments of 2078.


The activists had insisted that the animals not be killed, yet they were entirely too dangerous to be let loose where people could be harmed. This was the compromise. If only the activists knew what the government was doing now. They would shit themselves.


The worst offenders like myself were given the option to try to tame an animal or die trying. I had heard one woman had done it. Yet, rumors were she didn't live long after. If it was the government that had gotten rid of her, or her pet, no one in the prison could tell me for sure.


A branch broke under my foot sending a single shot of noise through the underbrush. Fuck. My palms started to sweat around the synthetic leather grip of the knife. Cows had been extinct for twenty years. Real leather was too expensive to waste on a dead convict.


I scanned the area to see if anything had heard my mistake and only silence came back in response. As I waited for my heart rate to slow, I saw a flicker of movement off to my side. I twisted my head around and was rewarded with the source of the movement.


A squirrel sat on a log stone still and stared at me with tiny black eyes.
I couldn't believe my luck. Since the majority of dogs had died out in the poisoned air sweep of 2029 people had taken to smaller animals as pets. Squirrels had proved remarkably easy to tame, and the new market they created had swept the world with an entirely new field of clothing, toys, and habitats. They were all custom made to fill the void left behind in the pet field. If I was going to have any chance at getting off this island alive, it was sitting right in front of me, right now.


A quick survey of the ground around me left me with a tiny selection of berries and seeds. The guide had mentioned that food was plentiful here. It was a minor shock to see how plentiful. In a passing thought, I wondered why it would be like this with so many animals around, but with a mental shrug, I dismissed the notion, it wasn't important. Taming this squirrel was important.


Careful not to spook him away I first placed a berry on my hand and held it out to him. I watched for a reaction as I carefully stretched my hand forward. Only a gentle twist of the animals head came in response. I dropped the berry and tried a nut hoping for a more favorable result.


With each item I presented, the squirrel only gave a minor shift of his head, not a negative twist, more of a curiosity. Perspiration built up on my forehead as I presented item after item.


It didn't work. I felt my legs start to shake from sitting still for so long and I stared at the squirrel on the log in front of me. In frustration, I broke the silence and cursed the fuzzy fiend.
"What the hell do you eat you little bastard!"
With uncanny speed, he shot forward and bit the tip of my outstretched hand. My leg muscles convulsed as I fell to the side. A tiny drip of blood pooled on my fingertip where the rodent's teeth had broken my skin. The world around me went out of focus as I watched the deep red turn to a purple and then a black.


I tried to move away, but my body wouldn't listen to my mind. I tried to scream, but no words escaped my lungs. Before my eyes completely glazed over I saw the tiny black eyes of the squirrel stare at me from on top of that log. Moments later another pair, and then another had joined it.


As I fell to the ground with a dull thump, I understood why the squirrel didn't except any of my offerings, and that's why food was so plentiful on the island. They didn't eat any of it.

<TEXT> The girl, and the fire, are pivotal in this, the final chapter of the series.

The by has been removed, however I am still working on the cropping. It may (will?) end up as a paperback as well, so the cover image you see has her hand sweeping to the left and an open black area for the blurb placement. I have been playing with fonts, but as of yet I am unable to find one that truly seems to flow. It has been offered I should use a fire, but that...would be too much. 

As for the series # I don't have much choice. I have had too many readers pick up a book out of order and than leave a negative review because it didn't make any sense. If I don't hit a reader in the face with what book number it is, well...

Thank you for your input, it is consistent with almost everything else that I have heard. I will repost a finished product in an update as soon as it is done. Hopefully to better praise!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am an author. I have many books out and more coming soon, yet I am seriously lacking in the exposure side of my work.

Things I have done are:

- blog release
- tweets (many)
- Facebook promo (shares, promotions, giveaways, paid promotions)
- local promotion, friends, word of mouth.
- Reddit ( limited, self promotion is frowned on, I know)

I have the work, it's available, people like it, yet I am lacking in growing my reader base.

Anyone have some suggestions on things I might have missed? Or is this it for me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple years ago Amazon left my pricing alone, lately they have beef flip flopping it all over the place. 

Amazon will not inform you when they change the price, you have to watch it yourself, constantly, and it's an incredible struggle to get them to put it back. You lose almost all your rights when you sign up with them. 

I may consider sending that email. Communications with them about my work have been a little painful in the past, but thank you for the suggestion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> E-book pricing is generally lower than print book pricing. Yet Amazon takes a larger cut on e-book, so you have to decide to make far less, or raise your price some to compensate.

You get to start the pricing where you like it, but Amazon will change it with no notice to you. I believe you print version doesn't change the e-book versions pricing data all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finding a beta reader who will be honest with you can be a true challenge. It helps if you have no personal connection with the person yet still value their opinion. 

If you do happen to come across a person that fits this bill, you also have to remember that their opinion might not match the masses. That's where you have o go find another 5 of these people and compare all the notes. If they all agree, you have a problem. 

That's why sometimes people just decide to pay people to do it. It's a faster way to the same end. 

That being said, most people, like myself, can't afford to pay people. So when you do get a core group of beta's keep them close to your heart, their input can be immeserable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that hard as long as you work the scenes well. Be clear on your transitions and split the fight only when necc. It wouldn't hurt to have a reason why you shift, a loud noise, or an object moving from inside to out. A thrown chair perhaps? Give the reader a reason to shift from one to another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> POV first. I would start with the inside one for ease of structure. Who is seeing it? Are you in third person? How does it start. 

Writing fight scenes isn't that much different from any other scene, with the exception of how much detail to pour in. You don't need to describe the sound his knuckles made as they impacted his front teeth for instance.

Work with your characters, pay attention to the flow and let them tell you what is happening next. Describe that to your reader, and you will have your fight scene.

If that doesn't work. Call over a friend and have them act it out for you while you scribble furiously.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My son asked me at bedtime, "How much money do you have?"
I have always done my best to be honest with my kids, so I answered honestly, "About $70."
His response was, "How do we live?"

Pretty deep for a 6 year old. 

I work my 8-5 and it pays the bills. I have the dept, same as almost everyone else. I try to pull in money for my family on the side, when I can, yet there is never enough. I write books, my wife cleans peoples shitty houses. We are always living one paycheck to another.

There is never enough.

And I am getting tired of being broke.

I want to throw off my chains of my adult freedom. Yet, I wouldn't give up my life for anything.

I did however question whether or not you actually watched it.
As for the reasons I love it? 
I found it entertaining. 
I connected with the characters and felt the loss when they were killed in the wrap up movie.
I saw a story line that was only given the shortest of time to scratch the surface of potential.
However, that doesn't mean a damn thing to you, and it shouldn't, because it's my opinion. AND your thread asked for that.

Unfortunately, there is a time and a place for using the word -said- in your writing. Some people may over use it, others might ejaculate another word in its place too often. The only right answer is to use it whenever you feel like in your own writing.

If I have only learned one thing in my writing life it would be...

Write the way you want.

You are off to a good start by expressing your feelings, now, take everything you just wrote down, and tell him that.

Even if you have to show him the post, or copy and paste and print it out for him. 

The words will do you more good if spoken to the right person.

If he is as good as you say he is, you will be fine, and you both with grow a bit and move on in your joint relationship.

My other works sell comparitavely slow, anywhere from zero - the low teens per month.

Of course, my promo time has been drastically reduced as of late and that is effecting my sales. As well as the fact I am working on my next release.

As far as patterns go? Yeah, if I self promo a ton, I sell more works, if I am silent, so are my sales. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, we trained for everything.

I trained my students for handling a drive by shooting.

When they got to the basic exam, it was a breeze because the basic scenerios were so easy com paired to what we practiced.

And yes, we used a weight, now remember that 50lbs on dry land is not 50lbs underwater.

We also taught students self defense in water, how to disable a panicked victim as well as how to get out of the grasp of someone who is trying to drown you.

I may add, I am a Canadian, our training has always been harder, my classes were harder than that.

One of my students has even gone on to be an Emerg DR in our local hospital. We still stay in contact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I have been together for 9 years. This is our seventh anniversary and it was supposed to be a special one. 7 month 7 years on the 7th.

We had planned everything out, but about two days before we left, the whole family got sick. And I mean, SICK. Chronic fevers, persistent nagging dry cough, sore throats, ear infections. Plumbing went south, the whole works. So we are sitting with the kids and contemplating just packing it in 3 days early, and driving the 9 hours back home to just suffer there.

We forced ourselves to do a hike yesterday. And paid for it at night. It was one thing off a list of about 6 things we wanted to do.

It took us almost a whole year to save for this trip, we get one a year at best. And now it's a wipe.

This sucks on so many levels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Losing control of your work isn't what you should be looking for in a contract. I know this goes against all common sense as an author, but you can decline a contract...If your publisher doesn't consult you on changes, makes all decisions for you, and treats you like the janitor...find another publisher. There are lots out there, and if your work is good enough for one, another will be interested.

Of course, on the other side of the coin, if this is all fine with you, hand over your labour of love, kiss it goodbye and start pushing a work that may or may not be what you started with.

Oddly enough, almost everyone who has responded to my comments are making great points for going Indie. I hope the OP is still reading them. </TEXT>

I class any traditionally published author as lucky, whether they have to push their own work or not.

I do believe many publishers are encouraging their authors to push their own work, after all, more sales are better for everyone. Yet, sometimes the time could be better spent creating more works for the masses that are waiting for it with baited breath!

(All readers still wait with baited breath right?) </TEXT>

If you are human, shoot for traditional. 

This coming from an indie author...you spend %90 of your available time trying to find more ways to promote your work, and much less time actually writing it. If you expect quick cash from indie, think again. You really have to work for your sales and even a small lapse in promotion can make a big change in the trickle of sales you might have.

Of course, some indies do great.

Just not this guy...yet. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In short, I have been self publishing for over three years. I have used KDP to give away and do some small promo's with my works. My best month was last December when I put a really large push. I had over 5000 downloads of my works, all free.

Since that time I have seen a steady drop until this month where my books are almost at a dead stand still again.

Amazon sent me a letter that I had to remove my works from other markets, as they were in conflict with the rules of KDP. (They, Amazon, have changed the rules so many times now since I started, I just ignored them until caught. Yes, I know, my bad.) In response I told Amazon to remove all my works from KDP and they agreed.

As of that day, I have not seen a single sale of my work.

Have I been blackballed for not playing nice with Amazon?
Has anyone else seen results like this?

What are your thoughts on it?

(For some reason Authors have a very hard time coming clean with actual numbers of book sales. I don't have that problem, but I can understand if you wish to be vague about your own. It's your choice of course.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.

One.

The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.

Two.

His arms stretched out, the magic built around him forming a bubble in time.

Three.

The scene of potential death burned itself into his memory, even with eyes closed.

Four.

In an instant a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.

Five.

*****

Aiden and Jess were only working on a science experiment to prove that the speed of light could in fact be broken. What they didn't expect is what would happen when they actually did it.

Time itself factures and Aiden is thrown forward into a future where humanity seems to be gone. Plants and animals survive, but the planet is in ruins. Through fate and a little help of magic returned, he manages to find a way to jump into his own past, and attempt to correct what he broke.


With each jump back Aiden unknowingly pulls someone else into his future. Those lucky few also find themselves with new power to go with the changed world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.


Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.

The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.

The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.


Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.


Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.


She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.


Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.


The rain stopped. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen to each other.

Don't expect some one to change for you if you aren't willing to change for them. 

Take some time for yourself every now and again.

Talk, about everything, always.

Never, ever, end a day while still angry. Even if it means staying up all night.

Remember what you fell in love with in the first place.

Know that people change as they grew older, the trick is to be try and change together, and enjoy each others changes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just went through rotator cuff surgery. Torn tendon.

Doesn't sound as bad as yours does. I was told 6 weeks in a sling, I was out in 4. I was told 6 months before lifting anything, it's been 10 weeks and I am at about %80 strength. Gaining mobility and strength every week. Slow and steady here.

Did it hurt? 

Hell yah.

It's better now though...and I don't have any of the pain that I had before. I wouldn't worry about it. If it hurts now, you will deal with it later. The end result is worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First thing I think I can help you with is...

With reddit it, it erases your formatting. The best way to get it back is to do a double carriage return. That will help make this patch more readable. I had the same problema couple days ago.

Second thing of note, the boy was supposed to be scared, but he sure was talkative. As a personality trait, most people when afraid clam up. A better way to make this come alive is to keep your sentences shorter, and more choppy, when he is speaking.

Other than those little things, I like what I see. You do create a not traditional mermaidimage, but it works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a big fan of the -show don't tell- writing style, and your first line starts me on an edge. I can understand the need to tell if you are trying to keep a story as short as possible, but perhaps some more description would spice up the writing.

"The trees surrounded me. Their canopy so thick it was impossible to tell if it was night or day."

Now, that's a simplistic take on what I see, I could be completely wrong if your intent was the opposite.

Just my two bits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can try to dredge up some sites. If you do a search on reddit I am fairly confident you will find multiple posts on the subject.

The biggest downside is the time investment, review sights can take months (or longer) to get to your work. Coordinating it all to come together for a big send off is a big commitment.

In case you are wondering, I learned most of this because I made the same mistake on my first releases. Live and learn though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reviews can make or break your work. It's best to give out free copies to reviewers and cross your fingers they like it. It's a very hard thing to do, but honest reviews with ups and downs are worth more than gold. 

People don't like taking a chance, even at free.

My best month I had almost 5k free downloads on my works, it resulted in 3 reviews, and one of those was 1 star because he didn't get around to reading it.

<TEXT> I wish you the best, but for the best exposure, you really need to start the promo at least one month in advance. The more time you have to get ready, the better.

You need to have reviews up and ready.

It's best to have as many blogs as possible showing his work and having interviews or at least something up.

On twitter, you should be doing a contest, a giveaway, something to pull in more readers.

On facebook , goodreads, LinkedIn, and as many other sites as you can get, you need to do pre-posts weeks in advance. Try to drag in as much anticipation as you can.

Local book stores, some hate indie's others are quite open to all others, run a giveaway if you can, and if they let you, try to have some posters up to promote your release day.

Sorry, this is off the top of my head, and typed on my tablet, I am sure I missed a thing or two, but good luck regardless! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.

Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.

The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.

The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.

Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.

Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.

She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.

Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.

The rain stopped.
