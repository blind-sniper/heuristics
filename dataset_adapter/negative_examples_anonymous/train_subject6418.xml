<TEXT> Yeah, I don't like reading books. So what? I don't have the attention span to sit there for hours and constantly read words. It just becomes tedious to me. It doesn't mean I'm not smart, it doesn't mean that I'm any less intelligent than people who read books. Just means that I find it boring to read and prefer to stimulate myself other ways like watching movies or playing video games. I'm sosick and tired of people looking down on those who don't like reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ja, fordi vi har utroligt meget brug for uddannede mennesker indenfor zombie-studier: http://ekstrabladet.dk/vrangen/article4746284.ece

Tror du selv p at en studerende ville betale flere tusind kroner p et latterligt kursus hvis det var for deres egne penge? Men nr nu det er skatteyderne som skal betale, jamen hvorfor s ikke?

Og jeg hvis man brnder for at blive lge eller ingenir, s har man mulighed for at f det financieret selv. Der findes legater, community colleges, osv. I USA til at opfylde denne drm. Der er ikke mere mangel p hjtuddannede i USA i forhold til i Danmark, hilket viser at uddannelsessystemet fungerer liges godt som herhjemme, hvis ikke bedre efter min mening. Jeg behver ikke at f skatteyderne til at trre mig i rven, den kan jeg godt klare selv. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus, relax. Nobody except for the very die hard fans are going to care if he insults the game. First of all, it's his opinion and he's entitled to it. Second of all, it's a comedy show so chances are, he will exaggerate his statements to make them funnier which is working as I and many others found the episode hilarious.

I would love to watch Arin play Ocarina of Time as it's my favorite game of all time. I know he's going to insult it a lot but I'm completely fine with that, and so will 99% of the other people who love the game. Because it's a comedy channel and because we don't take insults to our favorite games personal.

If you want to stop watching Game Grumps, then go ahead. but while you're at it you might want to also invest in a rock that you can live under since if this is all that it takes for you to get offended, you might as well spare yourself and your feelings from the outside world.

Also, tableflip will be released for all in a month or two. Get over it already and let them earn extra money to run the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's an idea how to avoid this: Stop using bisexual as your sexual orientation!

Maybe you are in fact bisexual but only want to date women which is fine. But here's the thing. When us men browse profiles and a woman is listed as bisexual, we assume that it means they're attracted to men too.

Now if said woman writes that she only wants to to date women, most of us will leave your profile again.

But DON'T start sending us messages insulting us, calling us creeps and pigs because god forbid we clicked on your profile thinking you were attracted to both genders! it's not cool receiving a notification on your phone thinking a girl finally messaged you (happens rarely) only to be greeted by a sexist insulting message because last night you happened to click on a profile once! Thank you!

And yes, this does not happen often and most lesbians/bisexuals are sweet and understanding but good lord some of these few extremists really know how to grind your balls. I wish I could say incidents like that have only happened to me once! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Denmark the Saudi ambassador blocked an entire floor in a hospital so that his mother (who does not have a Danish citizenship nor has ever paid taxes here) could be there in peace for her cancer treatment. This meant that many Danish citizens could not receive their cancer treatment because the beds were "occupied". Remember this is Denmark which is supposed to have free healthcare for its citizens who pay between 38%-45% in taxes to get free healthcare. There was also stories about several of the nurses going down with stress and some who quit because the family treated them "like slaves".
The ambassador later claimed that it was okay because "he paid for all the treatment". That doesn't change the fact that doctors could not check up on other patients because the Saudi ambassador demanded his mom get first priority and again many patients were denied a place in the hospital because the beds were "full".

Even more fucked, most media here were completely silent about this. Why did most media not write about this? I wonder. Also it later was revealed the person who ran the hospital had been invited home to the ambassador for dinner.

And they say Scandinavia isn't a corrupt place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thousands of people die in the US every year because they don't receive treatment that they could have otherwise received in Europe. The same would probably happen to me.

If every US citizen with a medical problem was allowed to travel overseas and get free treatment, the quality of healthcare in European countries would greatly decrease or just wouldn't be able to cope with all the patients and in the end it would result in native Europeans not receiving treatment because of the decreased quality or lack thereof.

The same goes for immigration. Countries can't handle the level of immigration currently without it decreasing various aspects of the welfare. This world is not some rainbow utopia where everybody can live happily ever after. When you get older, you will realize that things are not as simple as you think they are. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Nej, dette er ikke en "danske piger er racistiske" rant, det er blot en observation. Jeg vil lige starte med at sige at, jo, jeg ved udemrket godt at der findes danske piger som dater mnd af anden etnisk herkomst, og s vil jeg desuden ogs gerne sige at jeg synes det er helt i orden hvis man har prferencer nr det kommer til dating. Hvis ens prference er at date indenfor sin egen race s synes jeg det er fint nok. Jeg synes frst det begynder at blive "racistisk" nr man helt undgr folk af anden race/etnicitet (ja, jeg ved godt jeg kludrer lidt i terminologierne her, men I ved hvad jeg mener :) ).

Jeg har som s mange andre folk i Danmark brugt tinder til dating, men har desvrre mttet konstatere at matches er meget f og langt fra hinanden. Faktisk kan der g dage uden at jeg fr en eneste match, og det p trods af at jeg synes selv mine billeder er rimelig klare.

Jeg er meget sparsom med at bruge faktorer som "race" og "etnicitet" nr det kommer til kommunikation mellem mennesker men det er nu alligevel svrt ikke hurtigt at tnke "hvad nu hvis det er rsagen?" nr man prver at finde ud af hvorfor man aldrig fr matches, hvorimod ens etnisk danske venner endte med krester i folkeskolen og gymnasiet og selvflgelig ogs har en del matches nu i dag p tinder.

For en uge siden blev det efterhnden rimmeligt kedeligt og deprimerende at vre p tinder igen uden nogen matches, men s s jeg at hvis man opgraderede s har man mulighed for at ndre sin lokation til hvorsomhelst i verden. Opgraderingen glder kun i en mned og virker en smule dyr, p den anden siden koster det ikke mere end en biograftur eller en tur ud i byen p en fredag aften s hvorfor ik?

Havde det derefter meget sjovt med at ndre min lokation til forskellige steder i verden. Jeg havde jo nu uendelige "likes" og jeg kunne lade som om at jeg var i Los Angeles, New York, Maine, Houston, osv. Det har jeg nu brugt den sidste uges tid p og lad mig sige jer, jeg har fet en masse matches lige pludseligt! Snakkede med en masse sde amerikanske piger og det s jo ud som om de faktisk var tiltrukket af mig! Hvem havde troet det???

Fik nogle nye bekendtskaber, nogle nye Facebook venner, en del flirten osv. Det var som om en helt ny verden havde bnet sig op for mig. Da jeg nu havde uendelige "likes" s prvede jeg ogs i perioder at g igennem de lokale danske piger for nu at se om situationen havde forbedret sig, men det havde den desvrre ikke.

Jeg er lidt bange for at konkludere noget her, men jeg har lidt p fornemmelsen af at pigerne i USA er lidt mere tilbjelige for at g p dates med mnd som ikke har samme race/etnicitet som dem selv. Jeg tnker at det mske er fordi at derover er deres samfund meget mere multikulturelt hvorimod at min folkeskole og gymnasie i Nordsjlland var 95% etnisk dansk. Derfor giver det vel ogs god mening at man hlder til sin egen etnicitet. Jeg skal ikke blande mig i hvilke prferencer folk har da det er deres liv og de m bestemme selv, men jeg havde bare sdan lyst til at dele denne lille anekdote da jeg omsidder har indset at der faktisk findes damer derude som finder mig attraktiv og for frste gang fler jeg en lille smule selvtillid :D </TEXT>

Technical problems happen with every service. Lots of people have problems with Netflix for instance while others don't. It's just part of the modern world.

They can cut their monthly cost from ~$100 that cable costs to just $20 and stream their sports. It's a good service for some people. I just don't think that the Game Grumps audience is the right group to advetise this too. </TEXT>

The point of my post though was just merely to explain how Sling could be appealing to many other people and that the $20 gives you more than just Table Flip. Being able to stream ESPN is actually a huge deal for many cord cutters since previously that wasn't possible without an expensive cable subscription. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my understanding, the $20 gives you access to live TV from networks like ESPN, ABC, A E, etc. which is much cheaper than cable TV.

I can totally see the value in the $20 if you're into sports and live TV but prefer streaming it and not pay for cable.

However the addition of Polaris+ and thus Table Flip is really stupid imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Norway and Scandinavian countries in general are very great to live in with lots of security.

As a Danish person who has lived all his life in Denmark (which is pretty much the same as Norway) I can say that I've thought many times about moving away from Scandinavia, especially to the US.

Yeah, it's true that statistically speaking Scandinavian countries might be superior to the US, but I feel that in the end personal subjectivity plays an even bigger part. Some people will love Scandinavian countries, others will hate them. I'm not too fond of Scandinavian countries.

My biggest pet peevees about my country is that people are very cold and not open to meeting new people. When I studied abroad in the US it was very easy to talk to new people or even other people coming up to you and talk to you. I never really felt alone there. In Denmark though, it's a constant battle with loneliness because people prefer to keep to themselves.

I also dislike the socialist aspect of Scandinavian society where almost half of my salary goes to taxes. I mean sure, it gives us free education and healthcare, but that also means that our education and healthcare has zero flexibility and is in total control of the bureaucracy.

But those are just my personal opinions. You should come here for a few months and experience it for yourself. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it. I've met both people who love this place and others who hate it. </TEXT>

Throughout the time I've spent here I've tried short messages, long elaborate messages, jokes, serious messages, etc etc.

I just feel like IRL makes it much easier and gives a better chance at success. At the very least people who don't have much success here should give a local party a try and actually talk to a girl when they're there. They also won't have to xompete with hundreds of other guys trying to get her attention at the same time like here on r4r. </TEXT>

When you walk up to a girl irl you have 2-5 min of her attention to advertise yourself and with a little practice that can easily be turned into 30 minutes or 1 hour which can be turned in to a date with practice. </TEXT>

But I think that there are still many people who would be better off not spending energy on services like this. I feel that many people like me think that this is a much easier and effective way of meeting new people. Why spend half an hour getting ready and then spend money going to places and having to deal with body languages and all other pressure at parties when I can just sit at home half naked in my bed with a bag of doritos and CTRL + V a bunch of messages to people on r4r?

I feel like some people like me just needed to grow some balls and just go out and do it and realize it's not really that bad out there and that it can be much easier just talking to a girl than sitting at home hitting f5 wishing you are one of those lucky guys that hit jackpot and gets to have a 1 hour chat with a girl until she gets bored and stops responding back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, no offense to the mods here or anyone loyal to this subreddit... But after having spent a year here and haven't gone past a 1 week conversation, I feel like I can conclude this is a complete and utter waste of time.

It's one thing to never receive a reply from someone that you message. That's just how it is. But I feel like the biggest kick in the nuts is when you have a conversation going and after a few hours they stop the conversation. It happens way too often.

About a month ago I wen't out with my friends instead to a party. Something I rarely do. I manned up and decided to go and talk to a girl there I thought was cute. Guess who has had a girlfriend for a month so far?

My point is there are so many better and imo easier ways to connect with somebody else. I feel like this has been a complete waste of time and I've gotten nothing out of it yet had I jusy focused my time and energy other places like local parties, I'd have been better off.

Sorry about this little rant. Just feel like this whole online relationship and friendship things are the worst. Good luck to anyone out there still searching. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I go to a University in Denmark. Our school recently made an article about a recent paper from Saudi Arabia that was filled with errors and made up sources. I've heard many of such stories in the past. I'd say they definitely aren't on the same level as Western students. And I'm not just basing that on the students. I'm also basing that on the fact that their university would even publish a research like that internationally without even doing basic things like checking the sources.

I think that's a really big shame for those other students in the region who want to do good and don't want to cheat. </TEXT>

 Jeg ser ikke helt sammenligningen. /u/Maybestof siger ikke at alle familiesammenfringer er positive fordi hans er. Han siger at reglerne er en kse, hvor der er brug for en skalpel.

Hvis der er folk som kommer frem og siger at de har lidt skade af at vokse op med homoseksuelle forldre, s er det vrd at tage det i betragtning.

I sidste ende er brnenes velfrd vigtigere for mig end forldrenes ret til brn. </TEXT>

Jjeg lavede en stikprve p 2 af de personer som der blev refereret til og begge tilhrte LGBT organisationer. Hvad er sandsynligheden for at der ikke findes en 3. i den liste? Hvis man har partiske referencer i sin undersgelse, s bliver ens konklusion ikke ligefrem upartisk. Det er da logisk nok.

Desuden findes der ogs mennesker som er vokset om med homoseksuelle forldre som har fortalt at de nskede at de havde en mor og en far istedet:

rgerligt at det skal g ud over de udlndinge som vil Danmark godt, men man bliver ndt til at se p det store billede i hele landet istedet for at se snvret synet at "Jamen, min kreste klarer det godt, derfor klarer alle mennesker igennem familiesammenfringer sig godt".

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You know how you can go today and qualify for the NWC next month? I was at the Torrance one and I saw Arin, Dan and Ross there.

We were a ton of people standing in line to try our luck and qualify. I had waited for like an hour and there was maybe only 6 people in front of me. Suddenly Arin, Dan and Ross come walking past us all. It was some kid who was playing, maybe around 13 years old. Arin just walks up to him and pushes him to the side. We're all yelling wtf at him and one guy quickly comes up to him and tells him to back off. But Arin just faces him and says:

"Don't you fucking know who I am? I am fucking egoraptor. Internet celebrity extraordinaire. You do not fucking talk to me like that."

The guy was just looking at Arin completely puzzled. I wanted to say something since I was obviously the only one who actually knew who Arin was but I decided not to.

Then Arin was like "What the fuck is this garbage anyway?"

And he like looked at the 3DS and then yelled "Yo Ross check out this kid's shitty score."

Ross looked and then started laughing and said "Do you HONESTLY think you can qualify with that score? Are you fucking serious?" while looking at the poor kid.

At that point more people came to get them out of there and one of the men tried to grab Dan's arm and Dan pushed him away. He had this really mean look on his face and he was wearing sunglasses. He then took off his sunglasses and looked at the guy that had approached him and he said:

"Uhm... You may not recognize me as I was wearing glasses. I wrote an Internet song about dinosaurs and lazers in 2010. I'll escort myself out."

Then him and Arin and Ross walked together with Ross still laughing at the poor kid. I then saw them walking up to a car that was parked in a handicap spot and then they drove off.

Man, what the fuck is wrong with them? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There are adults out there exploiting these stupid kids

What do you mean? Are you implying that ISIS fighters are going door to door in the UK and recruiting the kids?

Don't be naive. The only way these kids could get in contact with the ISIS fighters and be recruited is if the kids themselves actively seeked them out on Twitter and other places. These kids already knew about the rape and murders and they still got in contact with ISIS fighters to help them get there. They were already motivated to join the ISIS before they even got in contact. There's nothing innocent about them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I also love that the pressure is not on Qatar to actually reform it's laws

Uh, yes? That's because last time the West tried to interfere in the Middle East, Arabs got angry and told the West to mind their own business.

Now the West is starting to mind their own business by not putting pressure on Qatar and interfering with another Middle Eastern country, but instead putting pressure on an organisation based in the West (FIFA) and now you're complaining that the West is not interfering in Middle Eastern politics?

Basically, the West is damned if they do, and damned if they don't. Now isn't THAT just fucking convenient? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup. Now imagine an entire country and its media with the same censorship mentality. Welcome to Sweden. Where any criticism of extreme left-wing politics will result in the media branding you a disgusting racist, where you'll receive death threats and be forced to stay quiet. This is a major reason why beggars and criminals from around the world come here. Because they know that our dear extreme left-wing population will do anything to protect these criminals human rights and silence anybody who is against these criminals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't worry about it. Hey, guess what, my post just got removed as well.

You've just gotten a first-hand impression of the idiocy that is Swedish political correctness. Talk about immigrants? Censored! I come from immigrant parents, and even I'm not allowed to talk about immigration because it's apparently racist. Go figure! It's only going to be a matter of time now before I'll get banned from here. Watch as the mods will claim that this post very post is racist. Don't even bother with this subreddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something fishy is going on here. Your post didn't seem to be breaking any rules yet it was removed. I'd be really cool if the mods would be transparent here and give us some sort of explanation.

Generally, if your post is removed on reddit, it still shows up for you, but for everybody else it becomes a [removed] and it disappears from the subreddit listing. </TEXT>

Sweden is more worried about [the portrayal of women in video games](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/20/the-insane-swedish-plan-to-rate-games-for-sexism.html) and [the lack of ethnic minorities in children's toy catalogues](http://www.metro.se/nyheter/morkhyade-barn-saknas-i-leksakskatalogerna/EVHnki!MCHp6rkn5uAK2/) and to [help ISIS-fighters get therapy and jobs once they return to Sweden](http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/orebro/kommun-hjalper-is-krigare), to be caring about the growing number of beggars and all the other bad things going on in society. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Muslim student in Denmark receives compensation after suing cooking-school for forcing her to eat pork - Was the school right or wrong? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-09 03:27:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Source: http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/skole-tvang-muslimsk-elev-til-at-smage-svinekoed/5556877

An educational center for cooking in Holstebro in 2010 broke the equality law, when they insisted a muslim student should taste the pork that she prepared.

The court has come to the conclusion that the school must pay the student 40,000 kroners ($6,000) in compensation for lost education. She stopped at the school after she was told to taste the pork.

The 24 year old woman came to Denmark from Libya as an infant, and she is muslim.

When she started studying at the school to become a nutrition assistant, she knew that pork would be part of the foods in the curriculum, but at the school she was allowed to skip the pork.

In the summer of 2010 the administration for the education applied new rules which dictated that students must taste the food that they cooked.

When the student refused, she was summoned by the school to talk about the incident. Here she recorded the conversation.

During the conversation she was told that the teachers agreed that you must taste the food that you cook but that you don't have to swallow it.

Furthermore she was told that if she refused, it would have an impact on her education.

The day after, she stopped her education and filed a complain. She insisted that she was treated differently due to her religion.

The court agreed with her and ordered the school to pay her 75,000 kroners ($11,200) in compensation.

But the school defended itself by saying that the student was absent a lot of the times from her classes and that was another reason why she was summoned that day.

A higher court ruled that her absence from classes had no consequences for whether she was treated differently, and ruled that the compensation should be 40,000 kroners ($6,000) instead. </TEXT>
