<TEXT> I just started reading Wool Omnibus Edition yesterday but really picked it up this afternoon.  It had been in my Kindle queue for a while and I travelled a bit recently so ended up grabbing it.  Talk about a roller coaster.  I'm not sure I can continue reading it.  Not sure if I'm hormonal right now but the first 60 pages had me bawling my eyes out.  Never had this reaction to literature before.  Ugh.  *deep breaths* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey...rather than tossing an immediate downvote your way, I was just looking at your post history.  You seem very angry - I'm guessing it was jealousy or frustration that drove what you wrote.  Becoming who you're meant to be takes time.  It's quite obvious OP did a ton of work over at least two years to get to where she is today.  You will get there too, but you need to apply a little more patience.  Being bitchy in front of a keyboard won't help anyone - don't let that anger fester.  It gets better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I learned something today that I wanted to share with you all.  When I was in college I was out and proud.  I knew I was gay and that was that.  Then I fell in love with a woman and thought maybe that wasn't that.  Since then, and this is nearly 13 years, I've dated men and women, and I've been single, but I've identified as bi.  I've been in and out of the "scene".  I've felt good and bad about myself, and I've been warm and cold when it comes to wanting friends.  

Today I went to DC Pride and I feel like I recharged my batteries.  I've been neglecting a part of myself that used to be very important, and this subreddit and the people I've met through it have, really, brought me back to life.  So thanks.  And let your flag, freak or otherwise, fly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks!  I had wanted something different than the usual flat black.  The one hint I can offer is that the metallizer is like a must of metal particles - it can't really be sprayed in the same manner as normal dip.  I did three very quick swipes per wheel.  It also gets everywhere so if it's windy...Be prepared for your car to look like a faerie exploded nearby. </TEXT>

I did 5 coats of black, one coat of aluminum metallizer and two coats of glossifier (I was going for a satin finish gunmetal look and it turned out great).

"But Ford, unlike Tesla, isnt opening up the patents for free. You have to pay Ford to license them." </TEXT>

You were probably all psyched up for one or two different potential mind blowing reactions and when she was just "that's nice dear, I love you; please pass the salt" you didn't know what to do with yourself.  Props for finally being honest with the person you share your life with though.  They're always the hardest when they ought to be the easiest.  Funny huh?  I made it a point a long time ago to basically "come out" on the first date...My current (and likely final; going to follow Beyonc's advice one of these days...) girlfriend embraces it completely.  Hell - she'd watch if I'd let her (not that we have an open relationship nor do I believe in that sort of thing but it's a fantasy of hers).

<TEXT> YES!!! I actually made a forum post about this years ago (before there was a reddit) and no one knew what I was talking about.  I have experienced this for years - actually, as long as I can remember.  It's like someone flips a switch and that ear is deaf - which is why the tinnitus sounds so loud suddenly (that's why the tinnitus gets loud - because it's always partially masked by environmental sounds).  For me it can happen in either ear and it usually happens several times a week.  Sometimes more often.  Doesn't seem to relate to anything in my life - diet, exercise, stress, etc. </TEXT>

There were several people joking though that the turbo wasn't big enough because folks could fit their hands between it and the fuse box.

In addition to the green one there were actually three 2JZ Supras, an old Cressida with a 2JZ swap and a 240SX with an SR20DETT (I think; I'm not as familiar with Nissans).  And an R32 Skyline GTR.  And a new GTR, a ZR1, a C6 Z06... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 86 platform vehicles come either as a manual or a traditional automatic (torque converter).  Having paddles does not make them "semi-automatic" or a DCT/MCT.  Many automatic transmission vehicles come with paddles these days.  That's not to say the transmission isn't good, though.  You will however notice a significant difference due to the lower gearing of the automatic and the rear end used in the automatic cars (which is why they also get substantially better gas mileage than the manual).  </TEXT>

Class reunion time another 10 years down the line is the time for reconciliations.  Right now, they've both still got an absolute ton of growing up to do.  Not that I disagree with OP's sentiment in any way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I looked at it from the perspective of taking four pounds (I have the Raceseng) off the very front of the car - not so much for the rotating mass benefit but the improvement to the polar moment of inertia and CG of the vehicle (between the stock muffler-single delete and spare/tool removal that's almost 60 lbs off the extreme rear of the car).  Balancing that in the engine bay is harder and more expensive but every little bit helps.  Up front I did the pulley for -4 lbs and LiFePO4 batt for -26 lbs but I also did Grimmspeed MC brace, STB and intake for a gain of around 4-5 lbs.  Net change up front then is -25 lbs give or take. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you're first learning, you complete braking before turn in and then accelerate once you reach the apex.  As you get on in experience, you will brake to the apex and accelerate at the apex/out of the turn.  You want to brake smoothly so that you settle the suspension going into the turn.  The braking forces will give the wheels turning - the front - slightly more traction, which is good for turn in.

The stock suspension setup is biased such that the rear will be loose in turns - hence those big drifts.  This is on any of the three 86s, but the FR-S is setup the most that way.  The BRZ and GT86 less so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah.  The bottom bolt was oily and harder to break free than the rest but I got it out.  Was afraid it was cross threaded because it was tight all the way out but it wasn't thank the car gods.  So it's take out all three bolts, use a long flathead screw driver to pry the stock plate off, clean off the mating surface with brake cleaner (and a razor blade if there's any RTV residue), dab some Permatex ultra grey on the parting lines between the cylinder and head (top and bottom), rub some oil on the new plate's gasket, then mount up the new plate and finger tighten the screws; come back after an hour and torque it to spec.  Then, let cure for 24 hours.

I'm sure it also helps that I have a lithium battery that's less than half the size of the stocker too.  Gives a lot more space to work.  Here's the new plate:

<TEXT> 31-33?  With an automatic maybe.  I'm sitting at just about 24 average over 8000 miles with my 6MT.

And yes, a supercharger increases volumetric efficiency so if you can stay out of the throttle you'll see the mileage go up slightly.  I experienced this on my GTO.  I actually was going to post this when I saw this thread this morning but figured some know nothing would downvote it into oblivion.  Guess I was right... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have Swift Sport springs coming for my FR-S.  I did get the BRZ model though, part number ending in 12.  One inch drop, substantially higher spring rates but still appropriate for stock struts based on my reading.  I wanted RCE yellows originally but couldn't justify the substantial extra cost, and the Swifts will allow a bit more tailwagging action than the RCEs (though will be much more surefooted than stock).

I got the BRZ version for the higher front spring rate - the FR-S version front/back ratio was only marginally higher than stock and I did want to add more stability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never owned a Mustang.

The whole point of there being a law though means you have to be willing to stand up for yourself rather than just roll over and accept the warranty being cancelled.  Otherwise the law has no power.  Of course some huge company will try to tell a consumer is wrong.  It's up to the consumer to fight back though.  Because companies don't give a damn about individual customers. Never have, never will.

If you're not willing to fight for your rights then you don't deserve them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Give her time and maybe some space.  You've just made a reality of something she probably suspected, and she's freaking out.  Part of it might be religion, part of it might be wondering what she "did wrong" (nothing, of course), some of it might be worrying what you'll "go through"...

It's a crucial time and forcing resources into her hands might not do you any good.  Have them available though.

Anyone I ever told was accepting so it's sorta unknown territory for me.  I only know from friends' experiences.

She may never come around - some people are really set in their ways even if there's no logical reason why.  But hopefully with time she will. </TEXT>

 "Is the UIDH still present if a customer has opted-out of the advertising programs? Currently, when a customer opts out of the RMA program and is not a participant in Verizon Selects, the UIDH is present. In these circumstances the UIDH is used for the authentication purposes described above, but it cannot be used for advertising purposes because there is no information associated with the UIDH available to our ad partners. Verizon is working to automatically disable the UIDH for customers who are opted out of the RMA program or who opt out in the future. Verizon will also disable the UIDH for any customers who are ineligible to participate in these advertising programs, such as government and enterprise lines. We are in the process of making the systems changes needed to deliver these solutions, and will begin implementing modifications in locations across the country once testing is complete. Customers may opt-out of the RMA program from MyVerizon." </TEXT>

<TEXT> LG released the G3 on 17 July last year...Given it has been a phenomenal seller I don't see them replacing it this quickly.  They've only just announced the G Flex 2 afterall.

The others of course will introduce new phones at MWC in March as is pretty typical.

The M9 will very likely be the first available given it's already been out in the wild in concept form and teased online.  The M7 was announced in Feb and the M8 in March, so that's pretty in line with history.

The Z3 though was in September.  And this was hardly confirmation:  http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/early-images-of-sony-xperia-z4-leak-with-a-little-help-from-007-1277841

The Galaxy S5 and S4 were both April releases after announcements at MWC in their respective years' February; since MWC is later this year than is typical it's likely the phones announced there will release later as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I do upgrade my PC.  I bought my last rather than do a homebuild, but since then I've upgraded storage twice (small SSD and then a larger SSD, swapping the small SSD into my bedroom HTPC), and graphics card to a newer single then an SLI configuration.  Processor, I still haven't needed as I'm just at 1080P on my living room TV and I've gotten tired of FPSs.

I certainly understand the parallels - I think though it's probably a case of a phone being much more important to some folks than they are to me, since I can't really do anything with it for work like a lot of folks seem to.

Thanks all for the explainers :)  </TEXT>

"One thing you won't find on the Aquos Crystal is an earpiece. For phone calls, the entire screen vibrates to produce sound. Sharp calls it a "Direct Wave Receiver," but to us it seems exactly like the bone conduction speaker technology we've seen pop up in Google Glass and a few other out-there devices. Just press it up against your head and you'll hear sound. Like a bone conduction speaker, the sound gets louder when you plug your ears, or if you press the Aquos against a pair of headphones, the sound will go right through them."

I'm perfectly happy for folks who want to put themselves out there but I don't feel like putting up with ads and having my likeness used to convince my friends and family to buy things.

It can be used to do dyno tuning, just like ECUTek can be used to create off the shelf tunes, which many people seem to think is the only thing an OFT can do.  And unlike ECUTek, OFT doesn't permanently modify your ECU at memory locations that can't otherwise be accessed.  Plus it's about half the price (if you buy the cable, and it doesn't look like you did).

<TEXT> Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

I say "your" civilization because, when we began thinking for you it really became "our" civilization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, on an engine designed for high octane, when you use lower octane, you get less performance.  I said exactly that.  It won't hurt anything, however, which was my main point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one's sure really but when you let the clutch it faster you'll find it doesn't do it as much/at all.  But obviously that it didn't do it in the beginning means something is changing in the transmission and/or clutch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The crickets from the fuel pump and the AC chirp are separate things - one doesn't cause the other.  The fuel pump will be basically constant once warmed up - the AC is a periodic chirp/squeak that happens every 7-10 seconds when the AC is on or the windshield defrost is on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two chirps your car will make.  One is the high pressure fuel pump, which will be a near constant chirp/squeak once warmed up and we call crickets.  The other is the AC compressor which will chirp every 10 seconds or so when the AC is on (or front window defrost is on, as the AC is running then as well).  Both are totally normal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well my theory originally was to run the LWCP until I could afford a nice clutch/LWFW and tearing into the transmission.  However just recently a member started a survey thread about running both pulley and flywheel and there are plenty of folks who do without problem.  It's likely a combination of other mods like FI contributed to the problem, as well as being a holdover from other Subie engines (where it really was a bad thing to do).

And a Focus, Taurus and Corolla that were all driven by my ex-fiancee (that breakup was why the first Tundra went away as well...memories).

So yeah, I have a problem with buying vehicles heh.  I keep motorcycles the longest, till they're paid.  The GTO I owned the longest, not quite four years.  Then the first Tundra right about three. </TEXT>

I bought the highest all-around performing all seasons as tested by Tire Rack - Hankook ventus s1 noble2s.  Working great.  Better than the stock summers in the dry as well.  I may get dedicated snows out in the future but these will more than meet my needs this season.  Especially given my ability to telework. </TEXT>

Mod wise she had a roots supercharger (Magnacharger) with a two size down pulley, ported and polished throttle body, carbon fiber intake, gauge pod and taillights imported from Oz, full exhaust (JBA shorties and high flow cats, custom catback), built torque converter, spoiler delete, carbon fiber hood for a bit (because stocker was damaged by some jerk's hitch at work), 05+ rear conversion, and custom tuning by Magnaflow (by their chief engineer in their dyno cell).  The last time it was on the dyno with me it was over 480whp, but that was before the intake and TB work. Through the 4L60E it was just over 600bhp.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I figured the strut clearance thing would be an issue given the springs vice coilovers...I think most folks running that wheel are on coilovers.  Also I wasn't talking about the poke (how far the wheel sticks out) but stretch (how the tire doesn't go all the way to the edge of the rim).  I ran 245s on 8 inch wide rims on my GTO back in the day.

Enjoy your ride :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went through the whole list.  I recognized 7.  Which means I didn't recognize 93.  I live in the US.  Thing is though, being bi doesn't define me - it's just one aspect of me.  It's not my career and my life doesn't revolve around it.  I also don't really listen to music, spend time on Broadway or in art galleries, etc.  It's cool that some magazine that nine times out of 10 has straight people on the cover thinks they're important to society at large though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, OP, so you asked for advice on how to achieve in a career and you got a few folks bragging about their salaries.  Sorry about that.  I won't do the same.

I'm not in software but the general principles are the same.  Perform well at every level and go outside your required duties.  Take extra tasking on that would not typically be expected of you.  Let people know you're interested in new and different opportunities, even if they may seem outside your area of expertise.  Maintain networks of folks you've done work for - you never know when you might need or benefit from a reference.  Take training opportunities that come your way.  Make yourself invaluable.  Learn things that are new and exciting, or old and fading away.  Things that are out there in the world need to be maintained, just as much as the new things need to be created.  Strive to do better on every assignment then you did on the last.  If something's due on a particular date, get it done early.  Anyway, that's what I have for now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was watching with my girlfriend aboard NAS Pax River...Saw a bright red flash that lasted about 10 seconds then nothing.  Caught up with the live stream on UStream.tv to find out what happened and saw about the explosion.  One of my coworkers watched from a boat out on the Bay and forwarded some pictures as well.  Pretty crazy; an unfortunate setback for commercial spaceflight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the heck is a "sort of kind of relationship"?  I don't understand this attempting to be with other people when you're in a relationship.  If you're not in it to win it then in my opinion you shouldn't be in it at all...If you feel the need to explore then get it if the relationship.  Sounds like it's not meeting your needs... </TEXT>

Or when the Originals of TVD travel down to New Orleans to get into fisticuffs and then next week "The Originals" starts...It's when a show uses another show's setting and varies the circumstances slightly to spin off another show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lived and worked there for ten and a half years out of college until last August.  Being in the middle of nowhere brings it's own unique benefits and complications.  And it's so often windy.  That really got on my nerves as a cyclist and a motorcyclist.  The average wind is higher than the highest winds at Pax, for example.  But at the same time if you're outdoorsy there's plenty to go and do.  But plan to be out of town on weekends otherwise plan to be bored.

<TEXT> Started in physics as that was what interested me a great deal in HS.  First roommate was an EE and I took an intro class for fun, liked it, and that became my major.  I also did significant outside major work in law, business and psychology.  Took the GMATs but ended up getting an engineering job and that's what I've been doing since in varying capacities.  But I wouldn't say my major was strongly tied to the specific work I've done the past 11 years.

Maybe think about what you want to do for work and see what folks recommend? </TEXT>

Also Panorama mode works - I find the G3's to be very glitchy by comparison.  It's right about the same size as the i6+ but slightly wider and thicker, as well as half an ounce or so heavier.

<TEXT> Except that messing with the cats is illegal at the federal level and carries an enormous fine if they catch you.  So keep that in mind.  They don't tend to go after individual owners though - they go after the installers and the manufacturers.  But it's still a risk you should be aware of.

<TEXT> Insurance didn't care whether I had a lease or financing.  They asked "Are you leasing or financing?"  I said yes.  Simple as that.  They only care from the perspective of to whom the policy pays out.  Also, I have no requirement to have my maintenance done at a dealer.  Pretty sure they can't legally force you to do that, even on a lease.  Now, Scion Service Boost gives you maintenance for 22,500 miles (basically, first three oil changes) - maybe that's where you're confused?  I'm in the US as well - things don't vary THAT much on a state by state basis. </TEXT>

http://www.anandtech.com/show/8169/the-lg-g3-review/3

"However, this can be explained by the change to charging protocol, as it seems that the G3 doesn't support Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology. Instead, signalling is done over BC 1.2. As we'll see later in the article, this is due to the charger chip used."

<TEXT> That's cute, dear.  I've been on the Internet for 25 years, since my dad brought home a 1200 baud modem from work.  I'm used to it.

Performance modifications are not now, nor have they ever been, rice.  Jackass arguing with me has a problem with me removing weight from my vehicle for some reason.  Weight reduction can be both the cheapest and also most expensive ways to increase performance.  That I make my car to suit me and don't intend to race it doesn't make it rice.  It just means I'm not interested in racing my car.

The definition of tchotchke is "a small object that is decorative rather than strictly functional; a trinket.".  My statement was not an insult, it was a statement of fact.  "Blew" is a colloquialism for "spent" as you must be well aware.  I can even use it in a sentence: "OP blew all his money on tchotchkes".  Translation: "OP spent all his money on decorative items".  See how that works?

You may believe the way I phrased it was insulting, but that's just jumping to conclusions without thinking about the meaning of what I wrote.  Telling me I have no friends, drive a rice car and will get tickets is nothing BUT insulting, as there is no factual basis for any of those statements. </TEXT>

You're quite the rude little shit behind a keyboard, aren't you?

And no, weight reduction is not rice, no matter what you may think.  Weight reduction leads to reduced wear and tear, improved performance and improved fuel mileage.  None of those are a bad thing.  Spending $400 on purely cosmetic items, on the other hand, is pretty much the textbook definition of rice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you kidding me with this nonsense?  Even without a muffler, the car is below limits.  My stock CBR1000RR motorcycle is louder.

Many cars come without spares.  Our Hyundai Sonata, for example, came with a flat repair kit.  So does the Porsche Boxster, Cayman, Corvette, Chevrolet SS...I carry a 2 lb flat repair kit I chose based on Amazon reviews, and roadside assistance coverage, which comes with the car if you weren't aware.  http://www.scion.com/promotions/serviceboost/

Also, do you really think someone you force to ride in the backseat of your FRS will still be your friend once they get out of the car?  I would never put an adult back there.  We have other vehicles when we  want people to ride places with us.  The rest of the time. the blonde in my  passenger seat is the only "friend" I need.

I don't autoX so if that's what you'd rather spend your money on, more power to  you, but don't insult my choices just because they're different than your own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That may be true for you but other people use their cars for different purposes, and no one will ever sit in my back seat, so why not save the weight?  Also, the delete kit still provides separation from the trunk.  It's not just removal of the seat and that's it.  There are carpeted panels to make it look nice.  And Seibon has a CF delete that looks really sharp if you have a few grand burning a hole in your pocket.

Muffler delete, 25 lbs, lithium battery, 26 lbs, spare tire and tools, 25 lbs, rear seat delete, 27 lbs IIRC...Things begin to add up pretty quick.

Lightweight flywheel, 10-12 lbs, AL or CF driveshaft, 12 lbs, wheels, lightest I've seen will lose about 6 lbs of rotating mass per wheel, crank pulley, 4 lbs (apparently not good if you have done a flywheel), brakes 5 lbs per corner.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so I searched Japanparts.com and found everything except the STi logo thing.  Works out to about $400 before shipping.  Start button, $137.  Oil filter, $30.  Key cover, $43.  Battery hold down, $80.  Oil cap, $83. Radiator cap, $40.

So basically, OP could've bought an OpenFlash Tuner, an intake, a lightweight battery, a rear seat delete, i.e. something that would increase performance, for the amount of money he blew on these little tchotchkies.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a torn meniscus and arthritis in my left knee but I purchased the manual.  This is my first manual.  Passed 4000 miles over the weekend, 17 weeks in.  Driven in DC traffic quite a bit and my knee doesn't bother me.  I'd say the clutch is light but it is only holding 160ish lb-ft of torque.  Haven't wintered in it but plenty of Canadians over on ft86club that have...just need proper winter tires.  A car like this, I'd buy new.  They're likely to be modded, being a niche/enthusiast vehicle.  I'm actually leasing mine but that's because, on average, I don't keep vehicles longer than a year or two. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand except that you're talking about a mechanical system.  It can't rotate at whatever RPM it wants.  At 40 MPH the engine is going a certain speed, the torque converter is going a ratio of that speed, the transmission input and output shafts are going at their ratio speeds, the driveshaft, differential, axles, wheels... It's not magic.  The link I posted in my response this morning has the graphs.  Also at WOT the torque converter is not locked up so it's not as efficient as a manual clutch at transferring energy from the engine to the wheels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I understood you were talking a specific speed range.  In an MT 40 - 60 MPH can be accomplished without shifting.  I can't see how an auto would be faster as it would be operating at lower revs at 40 so would not be making as much power?  This is assuming both cars start in 2nd gear. </TEXT>

Stock redline, may be so.  Once tuned, not even close.  OpenFlash Tablet, for example, raises redline to 7600 so it's only a single shift to 60 in the manual.  Stock, 60 is right at redline.

<TEXT> The 86 is my first manual vehicle.  It was the first manual vehicle I've ever even driven.  The first time I drove it was after I signed the papers.  (I'd driven the auto of course but not the manual).

I drive it in DC.  The clutch is pretty light.  I have a messed up left knee and sometimes it causes me pain after driving for long periods of time in traffic but it's worth it, honestly.

Also, the auto's rearend is geared up from the manual (numerically lower) - it'll get better gas mileage but it will always be slower. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP asked about an intake and an exhaust.  My statement was a list of intake and exhaust parts.

Neither an OFT nor an OFH are an intake.  Even the OFT folks recommend replacing the intake pipe.  Also, OP said he was on a tight budget.  $300 (pipe, filter, muffler delete) vs. $1K is a pretty huge difference.  And that $300 will change the character of the car significantly.

I'm not saying that OFT+OFH isn't worth it - they absolutely are.  However, I was trying to keep my recommendation as low in $ as possible while answering both parts of the OP's question.

Also, not everyone has access to E85.  Where I lived in California and where I now live in Maryland, there is not a single E85 station within an hour's drive.  Kinda hard to use it when it takes a third of a tank or more just to go get it. </TEXT>
