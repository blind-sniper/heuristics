<TEXT> Religion won't die out, for sure, there'll always be strange people who believe in magical small arab jews capable of answering over 7 billion prayers each day including on their day off, which is when most of the praying takes place, and who have big beards that also get eaten by fish and build big boats and live up to 9,000 years old 

(Wow if religion never existed, you'd think I was absolutely high as fuck right now.)

<TEXT>  "I'm Jewish"

 "I'm not religious"

 "I'm agnostic"

Make your mind up?

.

From a religious point of view (pretending i'm religious) from birth you grow up thinking santa is real, and thinking that religion is real. But with santa, you find out it's just your parents. And there's evidence for it. Thus making you no longer believe in santa.

.

Now I know that's a very blunt and narrow minded way to put it, but you get the jist of what I'm saying. In addition to how Christianity always needs money, doesn't pay taxes, and leads you to believe that after you've worked your entire life to make big companies money, you'll die, and go to this fantasy land. But when you die you'll realise that they all lied to you. 

Haha jk, you'll be dead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Modern society has decided that selling your daughter into sexual slavery and owning slaves isn't okay, so we don't do it. We've decided that there's nothing abhorrent about human sexuality, gay or straight, so we've tossed that out. "

So how did this bit manage to make its way into the holy bible? I'm not being sarcastic, but isn't that kind of... weird? To have a holy bible then to ignore it? Not that 'it' being rape is a good thing to do. [Bo hits on some good points too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxc20saM8DA)

In terms of having Charles Darwin on the note, that's awesome. Showing science advancing the understanding of the entire human species all done by one person is an outstanding way of showing how well we can perform once our minds are free. </TEXT>

So we've gone from asking a question about Darwin and religion, to me trying to look 'cute' 'bias' and 'clever'? Correct?

Science and religion can coexist side by side. I didn't say it couldn't.

The bible states that you can sell your daughter for sex, own a slave, cannot be gay or eat shrimp, and even goes on about living over 9000 years old. Tell me more about how we're not adapting the bible to fit modern society?

<TEXT> Well it's first of all not very easy to do, and there are many challenges faced in order to do so.

Firstly, the body or brain may choose to reject one another. Meaning that you'd die basically. Much like heart transplants, but precautions can be taken to try and minimise this risk.

Next we'd need to connect the brain up to the body, this will take hours on hours to complete, and it'd need to be attached to the spinal cord which is extremely / impossible to do as to date.

We need to connect all the of neurons, each of which contain up to 10,000 synapses EACH. And in some places such as the cortex, will even be in trillions. (Yes spelt with a T.)

And quite frankly, the technology needed is no way near to the advance level of the human brain.

While it may be possible to do a brain transplant. We simply don't have enough understanding and technology available in order to proceed. Though this may change in years to come. </TEXT>

Why are we adapting the bible when it is said to be the divine perfect book of good and bad? Surely it shouldn't need changing? I'm not saying it's a bad thing that we're adapting something that's out of date and is no use to the advancement of humanity in the slightest, but why is it being changed when been written by man through the voice of god? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Changing it by force will not change the quality, the quality will remain the exact same.

The image has it's own set of pixels, this is called the resolution. Making the image bigger will only simply make the pixels bigger, thus, not giving it any additional quality. A bigger image will require more pixels(Resolution) if you want to capture the detail.

The only way to get the image quality to stay the same while at a bigger size, is to make the image that size in the first place (with a high resolution)

Or if you're a tech savvy like me, can go into photoshop and just add more space to the work area, keeping the image the same, just adding more black space around it, and possibly using the clone tool to make it look part of the image for things that get cut off.

[In fact, I've done it for you. 1920x1080 just like you wanted.](https://i.imgur.com/bpjFxaz.png)

Edit: You fixed it while I was doing this. XD I'd still recommend using mine though, as it won't stretch the image due to the original being 1918x1080, and 'mine' being 1920x1080

Edit edit: I'm an idiot. Used the lower quality image and sized it 1920 for you. Send me the original image? </TEXT>

* - Spent 2 hours figuring out why it wouldn't boot the installer, it was caused by another usb.
* - Spent another 2 hours trying to connect to the internet, I used an ethernet cable in the end to get the drivers needed for the adapter to work (WHY THE FUCK WEREN'T THEY FUCKIN INCLUDED IN INSTALLATION?!?! WTF GOOD LOGIC.)
* - The wifi adapter kept going on and off, I fixed it finally though, somehow after half a day.
* - Spent over 3 hours trying to get the freakin video drivers to work, I'm running on a GTX 980.
* - Installed video drivers, buggy as fuck. Tried fixing the bugginess, broke the operating system.
* - There is no logical method of finding out what video drivers you need.
* - Couldn't login, would go black and return to the login screen. Opened the terminal and fix it that way.
* - Ran some updates. Broke it again.
* - Tried to login again, same thing as before.
* - Me being super wise thought I'd just put the backup I made in earlier. There's no option to do so via recovery.
* - Thought I'd repair broken packages in recovery, did literally nothing. Like enter ubuntu is now afk
* - Currently uninstalling this disease.


And they call this Linux with learning wheels?

Rating: 2/10. Very shiny. Requires a degree in space rocket launch sequences to get it simply in a running state. (And this is all using fairly popular hardware...)

Going to go cry in a corner now.

<TEXT> With the computer being years old, I'd **strongly reccommend changing the MB** out for a newer one, even if it isn't very good.

From personal experiance, older boards tend to catch fire MUCH EASIER. Mine set fire due to a very small (and I mean very small) amount of dust which overheated a capacitor, blew it up and caused an internal fire. If i'd of left it running while I was out, my house would be gone.

Not only this, but it may not be up to date with the hardware it's running, check and see if the MB manufacturer are still putting updates out for it and get the latest one ASAP.

Other than that, epic upgrade! ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just installed Ubuntu, and holy cow was that one hell of an epidemic. CPU failed initialization before I'd even installed it, required ethenet cable to download adapter drivers which should of already been pre-installed, and then the video drivers almost destroyed the entire OS, I'm hoping it's all fixed now. Took me 4 hours just to get the damn thing up and running properly. xD </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alot more secure than the new Windows 10. 

The NSA slapped their backdoors in last second before release. You can see the vunerabilities of Windows 7 simply by using Linux tools such as metasploit, most of them are listed there, and MOST, but not all, can be prevented with simple precautions such as anti-viruses and firewalls. Not only this, encrypt everything and your golden.

Now then, Windows 10 is going to be alot less secure with the NSA in mind from the very beginning is it not? Would you like Windows 7 or Windows 10? I'm using Linux as my personal OS, dual bootcamped with Windows 7 for games / production. GG NSA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> God damn, just spent all this time trying to install it, finally I install the damn thing, then the network adapter is being a complete dick. It says it's in there somewhere, but whenever I run ifconfig, wlan0 isn't there, there no enable wifi in the connections menu, and it's not doing anything. ugh.

Edit: fixed after running around with an ethernet cable :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Timmy,

What specs are you using, more specifically, your motherboard name.

Try the following

* Ensure that your hard drives inside of your computer case are **properly connected.** Look for the name of the hard drives as well for the next possible solution.


* In the BIOS boot sequence, make sure that the hard drive with your operating system installed on it is first in the boot sequence. If you are not sure how to do this, it may be in your "advanced bios features". or you can boot up the computer and spam (usually) F8, depending on your motherboard, to tell it which hardware you want it to boot up from (select your OS hard drive)


* If you find this too confusing, try unplugging all your hard drives and optical readers, except for the one with your OS installed. And ensure your HDD is first in the BIOS boot sequence.


* If the boot sequence is not the issue, then I'd recommend updating your BIOS, simply google your motherboards name and look for the latest BIOS drivers. You may need another computer and a USB stick in order to do this. There are many tutorials on how to do this. Check your BIOS version and write it down before doing so, in order to save time, incase it's the newest version.


* Finally, if all else fails, try clearing the CMOS, this can either be done in the BIOS menu somewhere, or usually there is a small black button on the motherboard itself. Press it while the computer has turned on, and it will restart, hopefully fixing your issue.


Goodluck! Any help you need, ask away! </TEXT>

Edit: 'Underclocking' the CPU seems to of solved the issue. Hm. Could it be PSU related I wonder? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm. My long guess is that the GPU 'crashing' aka no signal caused by GTA has upset something in the windows files, as I've had to force the computer to shut down, due to having no display.

Hmm. I'll try booting windows disk and checking for any issues. Thanks for the brainwave.

<TEXT> **Edit: FIXED. I don't know exactly how this resolves it, but I noticed the CPU temps going high, and the CPU multiplier bouncing all over the place, so I 'underclocked' the CPU to x12 instead of x16, and it seems to of solved the issue. I'm not sure how this fixes it... but It did =o**

[THE ISSUE (Reddit didn't wanna link)](https://imgur.com/JOHznwS)

Okay, hey guys, so I'm having an issue with my GTX 980, as are some others, and I just can't figure it out. It was working flawlessly a few days ago. #Sadface

This has happened before, I just switched the power cables to the ones provided with the GPU, and it was solved. But now it's back.


As you can see, there are multiple drops that keep reoccurring every X seconds. It happens in every game on any settings.

****
**Things I've tried so far:**

* Set Nvidia power settings to performance

* Set windows to performance

* Set pre-rendered frames to 3

* Turned off Vsync and put everything to low (still happens)

* Ran Microsoft Troubleshooter.... hah just kidding.

* Ran it at different resolutions

* Looked for Driver updates (even though it was working fine on the same update before)

* Running on Win 7 Aero

* Shut off services and processes that are not needed

* Full defrag on all hard drives (except SSD)

* Checked over wires, nothings lose

* Ran Windows 7 Disk searched for errors - none

* Removed recently installed programs

Extra note : Problem seemed to have started when the GPU crashed a few times on GTA (the system kept running, the GPU was turned off though, no signal.)
I'll post the solution when I figure out what's up, for anyone else having this issue.
