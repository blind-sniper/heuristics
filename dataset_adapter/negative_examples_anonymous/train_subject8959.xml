EDIT: I distrust practically any and all tech in the US right now for the record but I do believe money is more important to them than US interests at this point. I definitely don't trust them but I also can't set either company sacrificing global market share to satisfy American intelligence agencies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it can be demonstrated to have likely prevented any shooting this year, I'll consider your moderate approach. Otherwise all cute freshman year 101 Pavlov name bombs aside, no amount of regulation is going to address the real crisis, an emerging human condition that relies on libido and base desire and anger and violence when reacting to the world, instead of genuine concern for others. Infringing on a right our Supreme court supports as a constitutional one is not only the wrong approach to fix the issues, it's the issue that specifically led to Maryland failing to elect a shoe-in Democrat governor, Colorado to demonstrate effective recalls against Democratic reps. It will lose us the White House. I'm a nonhetero Democrat and I know this as fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I think these responses appear to be incorrect. Groupon is actually not making money. It's losing money on a massive scale. But that fact aside, they do not charge marketing fees up front, and advertising is an indirect profiting mechanism. They typically promise businesses an increase in revenue in exchange for a cut of the revenue they bring. There is a significant problem with this business model, they don't pay up front meaning businesses provide the service, Groupon collects the money and businesses do not get the money immediately. 

Businesses essentially front the service and are paid by Groupon in lump sum afterwards. For some businesses this is fine, for others, this is difficult to manage. The criticism lately is that often businesses find the increase in customers does not cover the loss of revenue between fronting the service and the decreased rate of said service provided.

<TEXT> Virginia is open carry and you don't see that anywhere. It's a responsibility that could be abused, sure, but the facts show it isn't. Dumbasses with drivers licenses concern me far more. A drunk college student with keys in his hand is a much scarier scenario. Any responsibility can be abused. Living in fear of that possibility or placing unnecessary restrictions on the whole to try and prevent these abuses is absurd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you implying concepts like income equality are not feasible? I'd be interested to know your sources on that, because there have been numerous examples throughout history of economic equilibrium.

Converse to your critique, history shows that when the income gap widens to publicly perceived "insurmountable" levels, as we saw in Greece for example, the top heavy system tends to collapse on itself and leads to economic turmoil for all. As bank systems can be deemed so big that they can plunge the world into grief should they fail, the economic ramifications of having a massive gap between the haves and the have-nots can theoretically result in much more catastrophic market consequences. Some of these I would wager we are beginning to see currently in the US in the form of widening state financial deficits coupled with coagulation of corporate holdings. In short, as the rich get richer and practically eliminate taxes, the poor grow poorer as the infrastructure that supports and more importantly employs the lower classes begins to fail.

Again, I'd love to see your source for the disparaging remarks against income equalization because I don't believe they are rooted in any formal education on the issue at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think mine would involve paying for my Comcast services with a Comcast bank issued credit card that I make monthly payments on with income I make working in a Comcast owned grocery store that I drive to every day in my Comcast sponsored transport pod. On the way to work, I pass the Comcast Public Library, the Comcast Community High School and wave to my friend who is headed to work at the Comcast Water Department. On the radio, I only hear the "latest pop hits" Comcast plays on their menus and between each song I am exposed to 5 minutes of advertising for the lastest "hit reality show" Comcast will be showing that night.

Yes. That sounds like hell to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd love to see those stats. How many people use Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Crackle etc who were enrolled in cable television when they started, and how many dumped cable television within 30, 60 days of using those services. I feel like Comcast attempting to buy Time Warner is an admission  from them that the broadband cable is their last possible attempt at future profitability, because television is dying. And once Google fiber and other comparable services start rolling out en masse, I think Comcast is going to start breaking off pieces of their company and spinning them off to avoid complete bankruptcy. I cannot wait. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Making this issue out to be a Bush vs Obama issue is disgusting and beneath this nations reputation. 

Obama wrote an executive order banning these techniques, an order Bush COULD have signed in the form of a bill passed by the House and the Senate but he chose instead to VETO a bill requiring CIA to conform to the Army Field Manual when utilizing interrogation strategies. 

Obama has allowed drone strikes, NSA wiretapping and many other atrocities, but don't try to tie CIA torture around his neck. This one is owned by the Bush administration generally and GWB/Dick Cheney specifically. It is a stain on our country the likes of which has not been seen since slavery and any attempt to justify it or distract from the topic is indefensibly atrocious.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, completely different than the US? ;)

Similar for me. I think the concept of electoral college needs to go, centralized banking needs to go and I think we should elect Presidents for one 8 year term without ability to run again and Congress for one 4 year term without ability to run again so they get in office, focus on the work and then get out without having a few years of campaigning overlapping with "work".

<TEXT> LONG answer, sorry in advance but - 

Similar situation with me, as you saw in prior discussion. My heart still feels "abnormal" and it's been 10 months. A heaviness or squeeze...I can't explain it  but I feel like I am cognizant of every heartbeat and this is new to me since my heart attack/myocarditis dx.

I had the flu last December, then a week or two after recovering, I was drinking with my wife at an event and felt sudden pain in my heart. Significant. I was half drunk  so I actually joked about it with her. "Wow if my arm starts to hurt I'm in tr- OW FUCK". I took way more aspirin than I should have and went to the ER, they doubted me until they saw lab results blah blah blah.

Long story short, staying at Johns Hopkins, the cardiologist told me myocarditis is difficult to positively diagnose and even more difficult to treat since many times the root cause of the issue is unknown. While still in the hospital, I receive a call from the wife of a friend of mine who I had not seen in several years. Come to find out he had a heart attack post myocarditis diagnosis and was in intensive care.35 years old. I'm 34. 

His wife asked me for advice about what to tell the doctors, what to have them look for since I seemed like I was about to be discharged and he was in a hospital in another state. 

The next day, he died.

Fast forward to now, and sometimes I think I'm losing my mind. I still feel each heart beat, I'm fucking terrified of getting the flu again and it feels like the medical community as a whole knows fuck all about myocarditis or what to do to prevent it. Every single doctor I've dealt with has a different opinion.

I love Johns Hopkins and I do feel it's an amazing medical center, but even their internal staff have differing opinions on what it is and how it should be dealt with. Some told me it will resolve and I'll be fine. Others told me it can be chronic and I have to weigh myself daily to watch for fluid retention or congestive heart failure symptoms. Some told me it was "just one of those things" and I'm fine. Others told me it could significantly impair me for the rest of my life.

One doctor (Hopkins is a learning hospital so you get a million docs) told me this summary "Myocarditis is so incredibly rare, it's essentially winning the worst lottery you can think of. And I have a better chance of guessing tonights winning numbers than telling you if you will go through this again."

What I have learned of myocarditis is : It seems to strike a disproportionate amount of healthy young men between 18-35 (obviously it affects more than just healthy young guys), it's possible to survive it with minimal scarring or damage if you take aspirin or blood thinners the moment you feel a true onset (at least that's how it went for me. Heart MRI showed "virtually no scarring"), it causes anxiety, depression, insomnia etc, it feels as if it changes the way my heart feels in my chest, there are many cases of chronic myocarditis and there's no definitive way anyone has explained to me to be declared "cleared" of it or to be certain it won't happen again. 

Sorry for the lengthy rambling, I am at work on break and this is something I'm incredibly passionate about. I wish you the best in health, you are so much younger than me and I felt like a kid on the telemetry wing, I can;t imagine how this is impacting you. Feel free to message me if you ever need to vent, I'm as sympathetic as anyone. Take care.

tl:dr - myocarditis is largely a mystery in healthcare and it messes with your head

"Why the flu vaccine doesn't work"

This is coincidental correlation in OP article. Please stop posting this garbage, it makes those of us who are pro vaccine look like assholes. The flu vaccine is one the least beneficial health tactics ever, and yes I'm counting thalidomide when I say this.

It invokes a false sense of trust that makes people like OP and the thousands who upvoted this article feel "safer" when they receive it, when the science says otherwise. Denying the science behind the ineffectiveness of flu vaccinations is like denying the science behind climate change - you are intentionally skewing data to see things the way you want to see them.  </TEXT>

If we were to perceive this infinite energy in its true form, we'd see the state of everything we know to exist as simply varying forms of the same energy. Everyone around you are simply different states of you. You are every single person who has ever been, currently lives and who will ever be. Along with every single other "living" thing. </TEXT>

My question is, over the course of years, decades, that kind of resource abuse is a zero-sum game. 

But a good friend of mine who is a devoted Tea Party member completely agrees with you and said almost your exact argument. I just feel like it fails to touch on the issue of preservation.

<TEXT> Thanks everyone, I appreciate the feedback. He is nearing middle school age. The divorce was years ago, I can't even imagine her discussing me publicly knowing how many times we've been to court. I'm going to try the pro bono avenue, I've tried before and I get many rejections based on wages.

Any attempt to return to court from position of plaintiff fails on my part, they don't listen or take me seriously in any real regard. It's hard to get into details, but essentially the relationship between a counselor and the judge in my case wound up costing me. I disagreed with the counselor regarding her attempt to medicate my son (I work in healthcare and knew a licensed counselor was not legally allowed to recommend medications for my son), so I requested a new counselor and suddenly she testified that I didn't listen to medical advice and bam, lost medical rights over my son. This was followed by my ex immediately filing and stating that if I disregarded medical advice, then my son wouldn't be safe traveling to my place. Ta da. 

A frustrating aside, the divorce started when I caught her cheating with a man 20 years older, who was both of our boss in the civilian military contract we both were working at the time. She denied this in court, I presented evidence she lied. That's how she lost, as she was proven to be unreliable in court. But the moment this counselor and I disagreed, the entire game changed. Just incredibly frustrating how biased the family court system is in favor of the mothers, but in this case I am convinced there is a loophole or a crack I've been overlooking that could help me.

Thanks again everyone. </TEXT>

Out of money and representing myself, I lost that single case and she gained majority custody.

My ex has completely stopped letting me see or contact my son and I cannot get the courts to act. I am still paying a large sum in child support and live paycheck to paycheck with my current wife and our baby, even though she is married to someone retired from military and they own three houses. The fact that she has children with her new husband was considered a hardship by the judge in our case and I had an additional 10 percent added to my final monthly child support.

I just want to see my son. I have no money, at all, to hire another attorney. I've burned through every dime I had in court costs. I won 8 consecutive cases. I have tried appeals, they were overturned. The judge told me to get a lawyer. I make too much to qualify for legal aid but my wages are on paper. In reality, I have a family to support and I'm struggling.

Anyone with any suggestions, please let me know. I literally have no idea what I can do now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) What timezone do you live in and what hours do you normally reddit? DC area, all day typically off and on. 

How many hours a week do you normally use reddit? 20+

2) Where have you moderated before? Game and music forums mostly, including the XBOX Addicts forum, dnbmp3, soulseek 'music', OKCupid and long ago dogsonacid

What do you like and dislike about moderating? I like interacting with people and helping solve problems. I do not care for having to sift through endless pictures of genitals.

If you could ask the admins to change one thing about moderating, what would it be? Bundled HTML notifications via email are always useful

3) What does AskReddit need to change? Less repeat questions is a big one

How would you improve AskReddit by being on the team? Actively search history, plus I am here enough that I recognize the repeats and questions that feel "common"

4) A post goes up and your gut says that it breaks the rules but youre not sure which rule it breaks. What do you do? Research. If that doesn't turn up a good solution, then I ask someone who may know (another mod)


5) Why is rule 5 important? Objectivity is important. This should be a place to share knowledge, not rant and rave. There's better places for that. No exceptions.

6) Why is rule 6 important? Should there be exceptions made? If so, what? There are more suitable subreddits for that. No exceptions.

7) Do you agree with the expansion of rule 8? I agree so long as it remains in genuine good faith adherence to the community spirit and not some personal act of spite against a particular user.

9) What do you consider to be a bannable offense? Blatant trolling, repeating a question despite the question being removed and harassing other users are significant issues.

10) Youre a new mod and you see another mod make a banning that you dont think is justified. What do you do? Stand behind the moderators decision and expect they stand behind decisions I make. If there's a REALLY strong case for "wrongful banning", I'd shoot them a PM voicing my concerns then let them make the final call.

<TEXT> Not that I have to explain myself to anyone, but sure. A country that dictates our policy, ridicules our economics in open public addresses and has less national debt than we do should be, in theory, able to support themselves without attaching their lips to our nipples. Just my opinion, but handing aid to a country that has repeatedly been caught spying in our government and repeatedly acts without consulting us (normally to the detriment of the entire middle eastern region) is not someone we should be shoveling hundreds of millions to when we have major economic problems in this country that could use those funds. </TEXT>

<TITLE> NYC Redditors, need a hotel/restaurant suggestion. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Going to the club le poisson rouge in Greenwich Village later this month for our anniversary, would like a hotel in the vicinityof the club. I've never been to this area before and it's my fiancees first time in NYC at all (moved here from Europe a few years ago).

I'd like to give her a great NYC experience for her first time, so looking for smaller non-chain hotel and restaurant suggestions while we're in town (two days). 

Any advice welcome, thank you!

<TEXT> A recent debate between myself and some coworkers got me thinking - is it rude to request a read receipt in Outlook? On one hand, a receipt allows you to be thorough when dealing with a given issue but on the other hand it can convey that you don't trust someone is going to read the email in a timely manner.

Interested in the opinions of others on this. </TEXT>

Please help me find this holy grail. I know it is out there, waiting for me to hate it. </TEXT>
