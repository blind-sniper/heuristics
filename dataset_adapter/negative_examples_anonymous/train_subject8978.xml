<TEXT> Hey there, I've been working with Dave for several years and am currently helping him promote his work online:

1) You should be able to get virtually any of the phonebooks from your local comic book store. Just ask them to order them from Diamond. The first two phone books have just been remastered. The third one should be done soon. Eventually the whole series will be remastered. I don't think any of the books are currently out of print. Diamond should have some copies of each phonebook.

2) If you want to order them as PDFs, you can go to either http://sellfy.com/cerebus or to http://cerebusdownloads.com. Sellfy is a little cheaper if you share the link on twitter. The second one, "High Society" is free. Cerebusdownloads.com has PDF and CBZ. Sellfy only has PDF but CBZ coming very soon.

3) You can download them as a torrent. Sim has [expressed his understanding](http://www.cerebusdownloads.com/DaveThinking.jpg) that some people just don't have any money. The two main Cerebus torrents out there have the entire issues, so you get the letters and essays.

4) You can read it a page-a-day (approx.) on Tumblr: http://cerebusonline.tumblr.com/

5) Dave does weekly updates every Friday on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGlbTwyt9cw4XZ9jRqrPeUg

6) Twitter with lots of cool photos here: https://twitter.com/CerebusOnline

7) Facebook group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/cerebus/

8) Keep an eye open on eBay and Twitter for sales. People are always selling bundles of the phonebooks or individual issues for cheap.

9) Excellent Cerebus blog here: http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.com/

Hope that helps, let me know if you have any other questions! I'm running a lot of the social media side of things so am very much interested in any suggestions on getting the word out there. If anybody has any ideas or suggestions, let me know!

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! You make several good points, I agree on the perception of women being powerless being very dangerous. It's one of their strengths, ironically.

You probably saw the point about the Twitter case:

http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-ruling-in-twitter-harassment-trial-could-have-enormous-fallout-for-free-speech

That's where feminist "ideas" about free speech lead us.

"I suppose you can view human society as a system not unlike a biological system or entity..."

I think that's exactly what Dave is doing here, it's an analogy, seeing the feminist hive-mind as working collectively while men, as a rule, work individually. He's extending that analogy to the point of suggesting a hive mind. Again, it's a work of fiction. If you're at all interested in Dave Sim's work, I would recommend Tangent. I think it should be sidebarred here. I'll definitely be posting more quotes from it here in the coming months:

Thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree...but I think you're both saying the same thing, Sim's just taking artistic license with the concept because it's about a matriarchy in a magical medieval society with talking aardvarks.

<TEXT> Ha, you're up on some stuff...I've been working with Sim for about ten years now. Currently helping him get his material online, for sale on an official site: https://sellfy.com/Cerebus and up on tumblr for free: http://cerebusonline.tumblr.com/ Just promoting his stuff on twitter, etc. Wonder what tumblr when say when we get to the 186 pages! Well, it'll be a while till that happens. But in general, I think r/TheRedPill would find a lot of what Sim says to be pretty insightful. I'm just going to post some various quotes of his to gauge the reaction. Although maybe going with "Women Read Minds, Guys" isn't the best way to approach it....still I've posted other quotes from him around here to positive response.

I think it's safe to say Dave Sim is very big on God these days, and so a fan of the Jews...and the Muslims...and the Christians. </TEXT>

<TITLE> "All women read minds, with very few exceptions." </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-15 15:28:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "It's a little more complicated than that. "Woman's intuition" is a nice way of putting it. "Women are more sensitive" is another way of putting it. A not-so-nice way of putting it is that women rape men's minds the way men rape women's bodies. It's not an exact analogy, of course, because rape is invasion and invasion is the man's way, not the woman's way; absorption and consumption are the woman's way; what they're built for. Consider the two genders; one that invades and violates and the other that absorbs and consumes. The nice way of putting it is that theyre complimentary. The not-so-nice way of putting it is that they deserve each other; serve each other right.

Some women are more efficient at reading minds than are others. Some only pick up impressions; they just get a "feeling" you could say. Others it's as easy as reading a book, For many of them it's like eating a piece of candy; absorbing the entirety of a mind in one gulp.

"Reading" minds isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is changing the minds they absorb; planting contrary thoughts. Changing her mind, the saying goes, is a woman's prerogative. Changing others' minds is a woman's darkest secret; the black cauldron of which we all partake. Some greedily, some guiltily. Some intentionally, some inadvertently.

What is spreading throughout the civilized world is an abomination. An abomination I was very helpful in bringing about and an abomination which can come to no good end. It is a very large and very dangerous force. Whose minds are being absorbed? Heads of state, business and economic and religious leaders. Whose minds are absorbing them? Unelected wives, grasping and opportunistic mistresses and concubines with handsome eyes and attractive figures.

Simply put, the civilized world is being subjected to mental bullying and thuggery on a monumental scale of which it is completely unaware."

Dave Sim, [Cerebus](http://i.imgur.com/aIIDecv.jpg)

----------

Just interested in hearing your thoughts on this. To make a very, very, very long story short, the above is from Dave Sim's [Cerebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark). Widely recognized as one of if not the most important achievement in the history of the comic book medium, Sim was vilified by the industry when he came out as an anti-feminist in 1994 with issue 186 of Cerebus.

The quote above is being told to the main character by the betrayed leader of a matriarchal movement. She was responsible for building a matriarchy but was betrayed by another woman, the story's main antagonist. This is essentially her tl;dr of how women were able to take over a (fictional) society, but I think the overall theory of women using their "intuition" as an indirect means of influencing men and that "behind the scenes" there is an absolutely monumental amount of mental bullying and thuggery that goes on between husbands and wives--including between very powerful husbands and wives--is an important insight into how the world works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what Hunt actually said:

Its strange that such a chauvinist monster like me has been asked to speak to women scientists. Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry. Perhaps we should make separate labs for boys and girls? 

Now seriously, Im impressed by the economic development of Korea. And women scientists played, without doubt an important role in it. Science needs women and you should do science despite all the obstacles, and despite monsters like me.

That this was turned into a sexist controversy and forced a Nobel Prize winning biochemist to resign is beyond disgusting. Things are way worse than you think. Nice to see someone has the balls to stand up to this nonsense:

<TEXT> "Journalism had been an early casualty in the war between the Female Void and the Male Light. "How do you feel?" had virtually replaced "who, what, where, when and why" as the journalistic cornerstone. "What are you feeling right now?" Every once in a great while, the Female void would run afoul of some military figure or a police captain or a fire marshal: some male who had not been devoured whole, who still had something of himself left to call his own. His answer would begin, "I think . . ." or "I believe . . ." and he would proceed to enunciate a belief, a principle, an ideal which was, to him, fundamental. The Female or Male Feminist (they differ only cosmetically from each other) interviewing him would be dogged in his or her pursuit: "But how do you feel as an individual, as a person, as a human being?" The interview subject would invariably look confused, discomfited at this. After all, he had just answered the question. He would paraphrase his belief, his principle, his ideal. "I think . . ." "I believe . . ." At this point the he/she interviewer switched, invariably, to another satellite feed: to another journalist or a psychologist or a social worker. Reasoning, Thinking Males with Systems of Belief, made for very bad television."

<TEXT> Wrong.

Paragraph 5: On one occasion, a man with deep mafia associations met then prime minister John Howard and other top Liberal Party figures at a fundraising event. It is not suggested that Mr Howard knew of the connection.

Paragraph 6: The investigation has also revealed donors have lobbied on behalf of a mafia figure to a host of Liberal and Labor MPs over issues related to their businesses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> dr_warlock is correct:

http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/03/echoing-big-agribusiness-farmers-sue-monsanto/73240/

*"If you are not familiar with Percy Schmeiser vs. Monsanto and want to see how such cases play out, you owe it to yourself to spend a few minutes on http://www.percyschmeiser.com/. Schmeiser was an elderly canola farmer in Saskatchewan who for 50 years had carefully saved seeds from his own fields, replanting those that carried the specific traits he sought. He had never bought seeds from Monsanto; never even spoken to a representative of Monsanto. Somehow, his crops became contaminated by Monsanto's GM crops, either through drift from nearby fields or from the trucks loaded with GM canola seedoften without protective covers to prevent seed from blowing offspeeding along a road bordering his property. The result was that Schmeiser lost the strains of canola he had created over five decades of seed saving. Monsanto promptly sued Schmeiser, saying he owed the company over $200,000 because its patented genetic material was growing on his land. Schmeiser spent his retirement savings defending himself, but the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in Monsanto's favor, even though it did not grant the company monetary damages."* </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you (obviously I'm not talking about you personally, I don't know you) are not publishing the cartoons because you don't want to offend someone, the same way you wouldn't publish something anti-Semitic and racist, that's one thing. Your free choice. But that is not what's happening here. People are advocating not publishing the cartoons because of what others might do. You are afraid of what they might do. This is rank cowardice of the lowest order. Freedom of expression MUST include the freedom to offend. As usual, Hitchens explains it best:

On the other hand, in 50 years there has not been one single, solitary shred of hard evidence that there was a conspiracy. But, hey, lets not let the truth get in the way of a good story. For anyone who wants a decent introduction to the topic, please watch "Oswald's Ghost":

Look at virtually any statistics on arrest and conviction rates on white vs. black individuals for similar crimes. Look at the incarceration rate. Black people are still largely treated like second-class citizens. Do you honestly think people get Freddie Gray-style rough rides as often in white neighborhoods?

<TEXT> "The police are able to use the press to make the white public think that ninety per cent or ninety-nine per cent of the Negroes in the Negro community are criminals, and once the white public is convinced that most of the Negro community is a criminal element, then this automatically paves the way for the police to move into the Negro community exercising Gestapo tactics, stopping any black man who is on the sidewalk, whether he is guilty or whether he is innocent, whether he is well-dressed or whether he is poorly dressed, whether he is educated or whether he is dumb, whether hes a Christian or whether hes a Muslim, as long as he is black and a member of the Negro community the white public thinks that the white policeman is justified in going in there and trampling on that mans civil rights and on that mans human rights." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The story of gangs "teaming up" to target cops got out there pretty damn quickly but was based on absolutely nothing. It was good to hear the other side, and they sound reasonable to me. Whatever else these men have done, questioning their motives at this point when they have the ability to quell some of the violence seems counterproductive to say the least. </TEXT>

And you get the impression over here that because they are destroying the property where they live, that they are destroying their own property. No. They cant get to the man, so they get at what he owns.
This doesnt say its intelligent. But whoever heard of a sociological explosion that was done intelligently and politely? And this is what youre trying to make the black man do.

<TEXT> Great story. I love the New Yorker. I live outside Toronto yet still read it pretty religiously. I think it's easily the best general interest magazine in America. Plus their movie guy loves Godard, which is cool. I think I read one New Republic story in the last ten years so can't honestly say I cared when it collapsed, yet every issue of the New Yorker has at least two or three stories I read from beginning to end.

<TEXT> Sort of. There is a very big difference between Malcolm X while he was in the NOI, when he basically just repeated what he was taught by Elijah Muhammad, and after he left (was forced out of) the NOI in early 1964. After he left he embraced a much more inclusive philosophy, rejected racism, rejected the NOI, embraced traditional Islam and fought for the human rights of all people regardless of color. However, he never rejected the philosophy of self-defense or his militancy. I VERY highly recommend this 1972 documentary, consisting almost entirely of footage of Malcolm X, which shows the evolution of his thought.

<TEXT> He was a good shot.

"Just three weeks after joining the Marines, hes trained in the use of an M-l rifle. He shoots on a rifle range [a score of] 212, which means he qualified for the second-highest position in the Marine Corps, that of a sharpshooter.

Near the end of his stay in the Marines in 1959, after being court-martialed twice and his morale was low, he went back to re-qualify himself in the range  still shot a 191, and still qualified as a marksman. That meant that he could hit a 10-inch target eight times out of ten from 200 yards away."

<TEXT> This is the thing, if you live in a fair-sized city you'll have some choice, and you can usually find one store differentiating themselves from another in just this way. Or, you can always try a Chapters which seems to have a fairly big comic/graphic novel section these days (at least in my city) and has a bunch of kids' stuff. The linked story was just some guy establishing his feminist bona fides. "I get it! I really get it!" Yeah, because patriarchy. Not market forces or anything like that. Hey, I'm going to go to Gamestop. I bet they have a bunch of games that are just about killing and stuff! Won't someone think of the children!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. The comments section in the linked article lists half a dozen comics for little girls, but to expect every comic book store to carry them is absurd. They have limited shelf space and thousands of titles, they choose the ones that will sell to their customers. No conspiracy against girls required.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen to this man.

Obviously if you just got the job, you're not going to quit right away, but I very strongly suggest you start looking for another job immediately. The thing about this kind of environment is that it's an emotional minefield and if and when you slip up (and sometimes, it's got nothing to do with you), it can blow up in your face very quickly and very badly. Start looking for another job pronto.

EDIT: Another point that probably should be added: Find out who the Queen Bee is and start kissing her ass. You won't beat her in this kind of environment, so CYA.

<TEXT> "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sigh.

In the last four years, blacks have held community protests against violence in Chicago; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Pittsburgh; Saginaw, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. Indeed, theres a whole catalog of movies, albums, and sermons from a generation of directors, musicians, and religious leaders, each urging peace and order. **You may not have noticed black protests against crime and violence, but that doesnt mean they havent happened.** Black Americanslike everyone elseare concerned with what happens in their communities, and at a certain point, pundits who insist otherwise are either lying or willfully ignorant.

<TEXT> It's a debate my friends and I love to have because there is no answer. 
One day it's one, the next day it's the other.

SPOILERS:

One of the big differences between the two is that GBU is a comedy, whereas OUATITW is a tragedy. In GBU, they kill the bad guy and get the money, in OUATITW, even though Harmonica gets his revenge, he will still carry around the tragedy of his brother's death, he doesn't stay with Jill, his friend dies and he doesn't get any money. There is some peace to be had in the revenge, but it's still a bummer of an ending. I think for that reason, GBU is more enjoyable, but I'd have a hard time claiming OUATITW isn't a better film. Just the shootout with Frank at the end with that music and, quite possibly, the greatest reveal in cinematic history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "For 200 years we have said to the Indian people who are fighting for their land, their life, their families and their right to be free: ''Lay down your arms, my friends, and then we will remain together. Only if you lay down your arms, my friends, can we then talk of peace and come to an agreement which will be good for you.''

When they laid down their arms, we murdered them. We lied to them. We cheated them out of their lands. We starved them into signing fraudulent agreements that we called treaties which we never kept. We turned them into beggars on a continent that gave life for as long as life can remember. And by any interpretation of history, however twisted, we did not do right. We were not lawful nor were we just in what we did. For them, we do not have to restore these people, we do not have to live up to some agreements, because it is given to us by virtue of our power to attack the rights of others, to take their property, to take their lives when they are trying to defend their land and liberty, and to make their virtues a crime and our own vices virtues.

But there is one thing which is beyond the reach of this perversity and that is the tremendous verdict of history. And history will surely judge us. But do we care? What kind of moral schizophrenia is it that allows us to shout at the top of our national voice for all the world to hear that we live up to our commitment when every page of history and when all the thirsty, starving, humiliating days and nights of the last 100 years in the lives of the American Indian contradict that voice?

It would seem that the respect for principle and the love of one's neighbor have become dysfunctional in this country of ours, and that all we have done, all that we have succeeded in accomplishing with our power is simply annihilating the hopes of the newborn countries in this world, as well as friends and enemies alike, that we're not humane, and that we do not live up to our agreements.

Perhaps at this moment you are saying to yourself what the hell has all this got to do with the Academy Awards? Why is this woman standing up here, ruining our evening, invading our lives with things that don't concern us, and that we don't care about? Wasting our time and money and intruding in our homes.

I think the answer to those unspoken questions is that the motion picture community has been as responsible as any for degrading the Indian and making a mockery of his character, describing his as savage, hostile and evil. It's hard enough for children to grow up in this world. When Indian children watch television, and they watch films, and when they see their race depicted as they are in films, their minds become injured in ways we can never know.

Recently there have been a few faltering steps to correct this situation, but too faltering and too few, so I, as a member in this profession, do not feel that I can as a citizen of the United States accept an award here tonight. I think awards in this country at this time are inappropriate to be received or given until the condition of the American Indian is drastically altered. If we are not our brother's keeper, at least let us not be his executioner.

I would have been here tonight to speak to you directly, but I felt that perhaps I could be of better use if I went to Wounded Knee to help forestall in whatever way I can the establishment of a peace which would be dishonorable as long as the rivers shall run and the grass shall grow.

I would hope that those who are listening would not look upon this as a rude intrusion, but as an earnest effort to focus attention on an issue that might very well determine whether or not this country has the right to say from this point forward we believe in the inalienable rights of all people to remain free and independent on lands that have supported their life beyond living memory.

Thank you for your kindness and your courtesy to Miss Littlefeather. Thank you and good night."

This statement was written by Marlon Brando for delivery at the Academy Awards ceremony where Mr. Brando refused an Oscar. The speaker, who read only a part of it, was Shasheen Littlefeather.

<TEXT> After he rejected the racism of the NOI, he expanded his view to oppose injustice of all kinds, regardless of color. Here are some quotes along those lines:

We will work with anyone, with any group, no matter what their color is, as long as they are genuinely interested in taking the type of steps necessary to bring an end to the injustices that black people in this country are afflicted by. No matter what their color is, no matter what their political, economic or social philosophy is, as long as their aims and objectives are in the direction of destroying the vulturous system that has been sucking the blood of black people in this country, theyre all right with us. But if theyre in any way that compromising, dangerous type of person, then we think that they should be dealt with.

And:

"In my opinion, the young generation of whites, blacks, browns, whatever else there is, you're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there's got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change. And a better world has to be built and the only way it's going to be built is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will joint in with anyone -- don't care what color you are -- as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Malcolm X never advocated violence. Ever. He advocated self-defense at a time when black people were being told to turn the other cheek as they were being hung from trees. He said it was criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he was the constant victim of brutal attacks, and I agree. He also said: "I don't even call it violence when it's in self defense; I call it intelligence." And I also agree.

<TEXT> Having studied Malcolm X for over ten years, your criticism of him as insane, violent and a racist is, simply put, completely and totally wrong. Malcolm X never advocated violence. Ever. Not once. He advocated self-defense in an era when black people were being hung from trees. While much has changed in the last 50 years, much also has not and I find his analysis prescient. Yes, there were looters and criminals among the rioters, but I find Malcolm's analysis quite a bit more interesting than your (not to be rude) typically simple-minded offhanded dismissal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the other hand, Malcolm X understood the root causes of the violence 50 years ago:

*In America, the black community in which we live is not owned by us. The landlord is white. The merchant is white. In fact, the entire economy of the black community in the states is controlled by someone who doesnt even live there. The property that we live in is owned by someone else. The store that we trade with is operated by someone else. And these are the people who suck the economic blood of our community. And being in a position to suck the economic blood of our community, they control the radio programs that cater to us, they control the newspapers, the advertising, that cater to us. They control our minds. They end up controlling our civic organizations. They end up controlling us economically, politically, socially, mentally, and every other kind of way. They suck our blood like vultures.*

*And when you see the Blacks react, since the people who do this arent there, they react against their property. The property is the only thing thats there and they destroy it. And you get the impression over here that because they are destroying the property where they live, that they are destroying their own property. No. They cant get to the man, so they get at what he owns.*

*This doesnt say its intelligent. But whoever heard of a sociological explosion that was done intelligently and politely? And this is what youre trying to make the black man do. Youre trying to drive him into a ghetto and make him the victim of every kind of unjust condition imaginable. Then when he explodes, you want him to explode politely. You want him to explode according to somebodys ground rules. Why, youre dealing with the wrong man, and youre dealing with him at the wrong time in the wrong way.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a very good documentary about the topic called Wings of Defeat:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZNy4l2j-Yc

The link is an interesting essay, but I think it misses a key fact about the Kamikaze. It was an unsuccessful, desperation tactic where recalcitrant Japanese generals sent young boys to their deaths because they couldn't accept the fact that they had lost the war. After the first few strikes, the Americans simply changed their tactics. Only 19% of Kamikazes actually managed to hit a ship. Having said all of that, I certainly don't question the bravery of the pilots themselves but there's a tendency to glorify them and ignore the cowardice of the generals who sent them to their certain death for no good reason.

<TEXT> Unfortunately, history teaches us that sometimes revolutions are necessary to overthrow a corrupt regime. Whether the Russian Revolution or the French Revolution or the American Revolution or the Spanish Revolution or what have you, after years of trying to work "within the system", eventually, after all other methods have failed, it's time to pick up a brick. The corruption has spread so far in Mexico that I don't see any alternative.

<TEXT> New York Times, March 15, 2010
By WYATT MASON

...By the time The Wire reached the end of its run, commentators
went from posing the coy question, Is The Wire the best show on
television? to making the bold statement,  The Wire is the best
show on television boldness that soon seemed spineless once
seemingly everyone defaulted to calling it simply, The best show in
television history. In the two years since The Wire concluded, a
pitched battle of ongoing praise has upped the comparative ante. If
likening Simon repeatedly to Dickens and Dreiser, Balzac and Tolstoy
and Shakespeare  hasnt proved adequately exalting, Bill Moyers
lately freshened things up by calling Simon our Edward Gibbon, while
the literary critic Walter Benn Michaels went so far as to suggest
that the beauty and difficulty of watching The Wire in English  the
multifarious 21st-century English of Baltimore detectives and drug
dealers  compares with that of reading Dante in 14th-century Italian.
It should go without saying that Duke; the University of California,
Berkeley; and, next term, Harvard, are offering courses on the series,
seminars focused not merely on the sophistication of its storytelling
but also on its sociological and political perspicacity...

Watch The Wire.

Who decided it was time to start liking her again? I never even liked her the first time round. Its like all these radio DJs have been raiding their mams and dads record collections and decided that Kate Bush is suddenly cool again. But Im not having it.

<TEXT> I really didn't know what to expect and honestly didn't expect to raise anything for what was a personal project for me. I've been studying Malcolm X for about ten years and wanted to put together a 1,500 page collection of speeches, debates and interviews. After about a week, it's been successfully funded! I've still got three weeks to go, so hopefully I'll raise some more. My only tip: Social media was actually quite helpful in spreading the word.

<TEXT> Two points:

Without fail, there's someone in every Akira thread who has to make the point that if you like the movie, you'll love the Manga. This time, I'm that guy. As much as I like the movie, the ending is fairly opaque and lots of the story is necessarily missing. Again, I like the movie, a lot, but the Manga, to me, is where Otomo really shines as a genius. That he wrote and drew it is a major, serious artistic achievement. It's a lot more mature because it's able to flesh out the characters and the plot. Just check out Volume 1, you won't regret it.

Second, here's [Godspeed You! Black Emperor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5d_eeGQxE), a movie about Japanese bike gangs that documents a phenomenon that I'm sure was an influence on Akira. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem I have with the Bechdel Test is that it's simply a quantitative and not a qualitative judgment. Whether or not a film passes the test says nothing about the quality of a film, only whether or not it passes some arbitrary gender rule. Having established that passing or failing the test does not say anything about a film being good or bad makes the test completely and totally irrelevant in my book (see: Reservoir Dogs, Lawrence of Arabia, The Wild Bunch, My Dinner with Andre or 12 Angry Men.) What's next? Let's see if the film has two named black characters who talk to each other about something other than a white person. Let's see if the film has two named LGBT characters who talk to each other about something other than a straight character. Whatever. How about you make an engaging story in an interesting way. That's the only test I care about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A perfect example of what I'm talking about. I'm sure it's an interesting book, but there's not one single shred of hard evidence in your post. Everybody who has even a passing interest in JFK's assassination knows who Mohrenschildt was. Mailer's book spends chapters on him. But conspiracy theorists always assume everyone else is a moron. Let's put aside all of the evidence of Oswald's life, the witnesses who heard the shots coming from right above them in the book depository, Oswald's attempt on Edwin Walker, the murder of Tippit and all the other evidence and keep going down the rabbit hole...

<TEXT> I've said it before and I'll say it again: the problem with the JFK conspiracy theories is that in 50 years, there is not one single shred of hard evidence suggesting that there was any kind of conspiracy. On the other hand, there is a mountain of hard evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald did it. Every conspiracy theory is simply conjecture and hypothesis with no hard evidence whatsoever. It's fun to speculate, but that's all it will ever be, speculation. Evidence and reason and logic all point to Lee Harvey Oswald.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, I could not agree more. Eraserhead is unique and fascinating, especially for the time it came out. Blue Velvet is a brilliant anti-Reagan film (not literally, but it puts the lie to the whole small-town America myth). I actually really like Dune. I think it's one of the best sci-fi movies of the 80s. The special effects hold up 30 years later.

The rest of his oeuvre leaves me cold. Lost Highway was almost unwatchable. Mulholland Dr. was just meh. Same with Twin Peaks. He relies way too much on: a) very slowly paced scenes to create "atmosphere" and "tension" that end up just dragging the whole film to a screeching halt, b) breaking the rules of reality in a way that empowers the "it's whatever you want it to be" crowd instead of presenting a cogent story and c) a repetitive attempt to parody a mythological view of America with a fake-50s style that just seems hackneyed after the 10th time he does it.

It's not a technical incompetence, it's just the choices he makes to tell his stories that do nothing for me. Other people like him. Fine. But to put him in the pantheon of Great Directors seems a stretch to say the least. Pretty sure I'll never bother with one of his movies ever again.

<TEXT> Godspeed You! Black Emperor (Goddo Supdo Y! Burakku Enper) is a 1976 Japanese black-and-white 16 mm documentary film, 90 minutes long, by director Mitsuo Yanagimachi, which follows the exploits of young Japanese motorcyclists, the "Black Emperors". The 1970s in Japan saw the rise of a motorcycling movement called the bszoku, which drew the interest of the media. The movie follows a member of the "Black Emperors" motorcycle club and his interaction with his parents after he gets in trouble with the police.

The Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor took their name from the film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In general, with artistic endeavours, we get out of it what we put into it, and for me, Lynch just doesn't fit that mould. I get less out of it than I put into it. He just doesn't work for me at all. I don't have a problem with ambiguity or surrealism, I love Jodorowsky's work, but I think there still needs to be a cogent vision in the work for it to have merit. If it's largely indecipherable, I find it tedious. I don't think that's the case for his early work, but as is usually the case, directors just don't get better with age. As I said, having just seen Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, bits of which I enjoyed, I just think he's well past his prime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I don't have a problem with ambiguity in art in general, but ambiguity and meaninglessness are two different things. Saying that something is "open to a wide array of interpretations" seems like a bit of a cop-out. I think Lynch is less "open to interpretation" and more "no real intention or meaning or serious thought or actual ideas". Again, I don't think he's completely shit as a director, but more like the emperor with no clothes. To me, there's just no there there and to place him anywhere near Kurosawa or Kubrick or Wilder or Scorsese or Leone or whoever seems like a stretch to say the least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the topic of David Lynch in general...Eraserhead is original and interesting, but hardly a masterpiece. Blue Velvet is excellent, and Dune is actually pretty good. But in general, David Lynch is a second-rate director whose reputation far, far outweighs his actual contribution to the medium. Lost Highway was almost unwatchable and Mulholland Drive, like most of his movies, isn't interesting enough to warrant further research to actually find out what it's about. His over-dedication to atmosphere means most of his movies are too long and generally pretty fucking boring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blood Meridian.

*"Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all.*


*Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that mans hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a mans worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of ones will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god."* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this quote from the story accurately sums up the problem with Morgan:

*"Crossing an ocean for a replacement for Larry King, who had ratings problems of his own near the end, was probably not a great idea to begin with. For a cable news station like CNN, major stories are like oxygen. When something important or scary happens in America, many of us have an immediate reflex to turn on CNN. When I find Mr. Morgan telling me what it all means, I have a similar reflex to dismiss what he is saying. It is difficult for him to speak credibly on significant American events because, after all, he just got here."*

And this is not just some knee-jerk anti-British reaction (Personally, I'd like to see Russell Brand take his spot!) but let's be real, if you're going to have a prime-time American news show talking about American events, it would help to have an American in that chair. Maybe now they'll stop fucking around and give the job to Jon Stewart like they should have in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You are completely white washing his statements about Jews. 

No, I'm not and I resent the charge that I would, for some reason, defend an anti-Semite. Again, take a look at the videos I've posted on youtube, find even one that you could call anti-Semitic. The closest you're going to get is the interview with [Dr. Kenneth Clark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9C_e0EUbas) where he is defending the NOI from charges of antisemitism.

Likewise, I'd be happy to email you (or anyone else) the 800-pages of speeches, debates and interviews that I compiled. You will not find one single instance of antisemitism. Not. One. In fact, what you will find are statements like this:

*"If you have read what the Honorable Elijah Muhammad has written and he has written much, I dont think you can find an article where he has ever pointed out the Jew as an exploiter of the black man. He speaks of the exploiter. Period. He doesnt break it down in terms of Frenchmen or an Englishmen or a Jew or a German, he speaks of the exploiter and sometimes the man who is the most guilty of exploitation will think you are pointing the finger at him and put out the propaganda that youre anti-this or anti-that, we make no distinction between exploitation and exploiter." (Debate with Bayard Rustin, 1960)*

Later, after he left the NOI, he stated:

"Since I learned the truth in Mecca, **my dearest friends have come to include all kinds  some Christians, Jews**, Buddhists, Hindus, agnostics, and even atheists! I have friends who are called capitalists, Socialists, and Communists! Some of my friends are moderates, conservatives, extremists  some are even Uncle Toms! My friends today are black, brown, red, yellow, and white!" (Autobiography of Malcolm X, p. 375)

You are confusing Malcolm X with Farrakhan who I think, quite clearly, is an anti-Semite.

 In the meantime, may I ask what those people being Jewish had to do with his claim that they were taking advantage of the black community? 

Are you denying that some of the people who exploited black people were Jewish? Are you denying that some of them were Italian? Some were Polish? Some were black? It's a simple fact that some black people were exploited by some Jewish people and some Italians and some Poles and some Blacks. The fact that they were Jewish does not make them immune to criticism. I get the impression that you think any criticism of anyone who is Jewish is automatically antisemitism. It is not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who has uploaded [several hours](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978) of Malcolm X speeches and debates to youtube and compiled an Ebook of over [800 pages](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/malcolm-x-e-book.html) of speeches, debates and interviews, I think it's safe to say that I'm fairly familiar with Malcolm X. Thus, it seems absurd to suggest that I'm not familiar with his beliefs when he was in the Nation of Islam. You can hear Malcolm X repudiate his previous position [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgqIek2TYvg), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDQ2EKmc3g) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xXB48l-OlE). You can read my own take on it [here](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/the-men-who-killed-malcolm-x.html). You can criticize him for beliefs that he rejected if you like, but that seems like cherry-picking facts in order to make a point, which seems fundamentally dishonest to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but that's complete nonsense. You can take a look at either the [several hours of footage that I've uploaded](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978), or if you like, you can ask for a copy of the free Ebook that I created with over [800 pages of speeches, debates and interviews](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/malcolm-x-e-book.html), and I challenge you to find this "outspoken anti-semitism". This is just more of the same slander that's been going on for almost fifty years. There are some speeches were he is critical of Jewish people who own buildings where black people were being charged exorbitant rent, but that was about the exorbitant rent, not the fact that they were Jewish. In fact, in several speeches, he uses Jews as a model for black people, when he was arguing for a separate black state. The claim that Malcolm X was an outspoken anti-semite is ridiculous. BTW, [Manning Marable's book was crap](http://mxmission.blogspot.ca/2011/04/paper-tiger-manning-marables-poison-pen.html). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Contrary to popular belief, Malcolm X NEVER preached violence. He preached self-defense. If someone comes at you with a gun or a knife or a rope with the intention of doing you harm, you have the right to defend yourself. This was, unfortunately, a novel concept in 1960. If you read up on MLK, you will see that he was becoming more and  more aligned with Malcolm X and vice versa. It is a fallacy to suggest that they were on opposite sides of the fence. Thanks for the comment.

<TEXT> It is disappointing, to say the least, that the perception of Malcolm X as a racist and a hatemonger remains. It is unsurprising that someone as intelligent as Malcolm X could easily forsee this viewpoint. As he wrote in his autobiography:

*"I want you to watch and see if I'm not right in what I say: that the white man in his press, is going to identify me with "hate." He will make use of me dead, as he has made use of me alive, as a convenient symbol of "hatred"and that will help him to escape facing the truth."* 

While I certainly understand the internet's general bias against self-promotion, I must post [this essay that I wrote](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/the-men-who-killed-malcolm-x.html) several years ago. Perhaps it will help change the minds of people who still identify him with 'hate'. At the very least, if you're going to slander him, you should read his autobiography and get your facts straight. I run the largest collection of [Malcolm X videos on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978). I would suggest that those who think Malcolm X was a racist and a hatemonger listen to the man himself and see that any such depiction is absurd, insulting and simply wrong. He was certainly a vocal opponent of white hate while he was in the NOI, but he repudiated some of those views after he left. I maintain that many of those criticisms of White America were valid then and are valid now.

Thanks to the OP for the post. </TEXT>

Yeah, this is definitely one of the main problems. He's sort of made to be the protagonist of the movie, but in the book he's clearly unhinged. One of the problems in the movie is that he's got that sort of cool, gravelly voice that makes him sound like Clint Eastwood or something, but in the book his voice is described as completely monotone, devoid of any emotion, because he's severely disturbed. He's also a proto-fascist, who identifies very strongly with the right-wing. BTW, he's based on Ditko's [Mr. A](http://ditkocultist.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/graphic-illusions-mr-a0001.jpg). </TEXT>

Having said that, there were two things that the movie did brilliantly, one was The Comedian, they really nailed him. The other was Dr. Manhattan. His flashback sequence explaining his origin with the quiet, calm narration and the Philip Glass music was really, really well done. 

What would be great is Terry Gilliam doing the comic as a miniseries for HBO.

<TEXT> I love this Harold Bloom quote about it:

"The first time I read Blood Meridian, I was so appalled that while I was held, I gave up after about 60 pages. I dont think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I dont remember 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares."

<TEXT> *"The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population."* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Garrison was a nutjob. Watch [Oswald's Ghost](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oswald/). Garrison was certifiable and the majority of his "evidence" was useless conjecture. So Clay worked with the CIA? So what? The Kennedy Assassination is a million pieces of string that go nowhere. Fifty years later, still no hard evidence, just "Clay worked with the CIA" or "Oswald went to Russia." Yes, yes, but so what? Now that we know that, what do we know? As for the HSCA, here's an excerpt from an excellent [interview with Gerald Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):

**Q: Can you explain what the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1978-79) found out in the acoustic evidence, and what happened afterward concerning the issue of the reliability of the evidence?**

*A: "The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions. The most serious of which was that at the time that the Select Committee experts thought the shots were, [it] actually, [was] one minute after the assassination had actually taken place. Dealey Plaza is a veritable echo chamber, and it makes it very difficult sometimes to analyze the acoustic testimony. However, by looking at the statements of a witness who gave an opinion as to the source of the shots, we can see certain trends. Eighty-eight percent of the 179 witnesses who expressed an opinion said there were three shots and three shots only. The largest group that identified a location, 28 percent, said they came from the book depository. Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location."*


Check out the whole interview, it's quite good. And really, Oswald's Ghost is excellent as well.

The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.

<TEXT> Seems like a lot of people have trouble getting into it the first time, including [Harold Bloom](http://www.avclub.com/articles/harold-bloom-on-blood-meridian,29214/):

"The first time I read Blood Meridian, I was so appalled that while I was held, I gave up after about 60 pages. I dont think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I dont remember 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares. And then the third time, it went off like a shot. I went straight through it and was exhilarated. I said, My God! This reminds me of Thomas Pynchon at his best, or Nathanael West. It was the greatest single book since Faulkners As I Lay Dying. In fact, I taught it for several years in a class I gave here at Yaleinterestingly enough, in a sequence starting with Faulkners As I Lay Dying, moving on to Miss Lonelyhearts, then The Crying of Lot 49, and the fourth in the sequence was Blood Meridian." </TEXT>

<TEXT> My guess: Willy is gonna die.

They've sort of set him up as a quasi-Jimmy Darmody. Now that he's mixed up with gangsters, he's going to have some serious problems. I think they're foreshadowing it with Willy staying in Eddie's room. Now, with the Feds on Eli, Willy is directly mixed up in everything. We know that if Nucky has to kill Willy to save himself, he will. Plus, it would just be so incredibly tragic for Eli, it's the thing he cares about and when Nucky finds out Eli is ratting on him (and he will), Nucky will do whatever it takes to save himself, even if it means killing his brother's son, or letting him die. FWIW, the last episode of the season is called "Farewell Daddy Blues". </TEXT>

He took on the Soviet Union and (with lots of U.S. help) the Mujahadeen slowly bled the USSR dry and helped speed up its collapse. It wasn't the main cause, but it didn't help them. Then he turned his sights on the U.S. and with 19 hijackers set the U.S. on a course of war for over a decade, slowly bleeding them of trillions of dollars. Now the USA sits as a virtual police state, bailing out banks while the middle class disappears. He was an asshole, but he was a smart asshole.

<TEXT> Thomas Frank has an excellent piece in the new Baffler about this:

http://thebaffler.com/past/academy_fight_song

Political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg tells the sorry tale in his 2011 book, The Fall of the Faculty. Back in the day, Ginsberg tells us, American universities were governed by professors, who would take time out from their academic careers to manage the institutions business affairs. Today, however, the business side of the university has been captured by a class of professionals who have nothing to do with the pedagogical enterprise itself.

Administrators: Their salaries are generous, their ranks expand year after year, and their work requires no peer review and not even much effort. As Ginsberg reminds us, most of them dont teach courses, they dont squabble like English professors at the MLA, and no one ever suggests replacing them with adjuncts or temps. As tuition balloons, it is administrators who prosper. In fact, their fortunes are an almost exact reverse image of the tuition-indebtedness of the young. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, check out Overnight. I think you'll be surprised at exactly how much of a complete and utter shitbag Troy Duffy really is. I mean, there are scumbags and then there are scumbags and then there's Troy Duffy. The article doesn't even tell the half of it. So full of himself it's unbelievable. If he had just fucked himself over, that would be one thing, but he fucks over his friends, and then he tries to fuck over Harvey Weinstein. Big mistake. Big, big mistake.

<TEXT> Yeah, I think you're right. In The Firm, Bex obviously is a bit of a nutter and he "needs the buzz" but a lot of the other guys just want to be a part of something. "It's about belonging" says one guy at the end. They want to be a part of something and the violence is how they qualify themselves. We all have aggressive tendencies but you have to be a bit of a sociopath to make hooliganism part of your life. Fighting is one thing, slicing people's mouths open with razor blades is something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sigh.

Can a "boy" beat up a grown man to have such injuries as Zimmerman had? It's not slander if it's true and shows evidence that's relevant, such as showing that Trayvon was perfectly capable of violence.

You mean the ["very insignificant"](http://news.yahoo.com/zimmerman-trial-judge-tells-jury-ignore-detectives-description-163625943.html) injuries? Here we have the crux of the issue. Zimmerman was a coward. He had 25 pounds on Trayvon! Yet he couldn't handle him, and instead of fighting like a man, he shot an unarmed 17-year-old like a bitch. You just accept without question that Zimmerman shot in self-defense. I don't.

If your hero George had just been minding his own business, none of this would be an issue. Instead, he played cop and ended up murdering an unarmed 17-year-old. As a result, he will live the rest of his life in fear. Good.

<TEXT> People can watch the entire interview and decide for themselves. What makes his answer particularly disgusting is that, as Cenk pointed out, he was being asked a question about how to bring people together, how to bring some healing to this situation. And he answers by bringing up the guns and drugs, which is just disgusting in the extreme. Perhaps the worst answer he could have given.

That George Zimmerman will live the rest of his life in fear, looking over his shoulder, bothers me not in the slightest. That's what you get for stalking and murdering an unarmed person. Fuck him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, all of that came out during the trial. You just don't seem to understand why it is wrong to slander a dead boy that your brother murdered. The links you provide are not evidence that he was growing marijuana nor that he was seriously trying to purchase a gun. How many 17-year-olds' cellphones have pictures of weed and guns? Probably most of them, but that is not evidence, and certainly not the kind of evidence that you would need to justify slandering a dead boy that your brother murdered after he got away with murdering him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the state of Florida, the season on African-Americans now runs year round. Come one, come all.  And bring a handgun. The legislators are fine with this blood on their hands. The governor, too. One man accosted another and when it became a fist fight, one man  and one man only  had a firearm. The rest is racial rationalization and dishonorable commentary.

If I were a person of color in Florida, I would pick up a brick and start walking toward that courthouse in Sanford. Those that do not, those that hold the pain and betrayal inside and somehow manage to resist violence  these citizens are testament to a stoic tolerance that is more than the rest of us deserve.  I confess, their patience and patriotism is well beyond my own.

Behold, the lewd, pornographic embrace of two great American pathologies:  Race and guns, both of which have conspired not only to take the life of a teenager, but to make that killing entirely permissible.  I cant look an African-American parent in the eye for thinking about what they must tell their sons about what can happen to them on the streets of their country.  Tonight, anyone who truly understands what justice is and what it requires of a society is ashamed to call himself an American. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Posner's answer]( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):

**Q: Can you explain what the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1978-79) found out in the acoustic evidence, and what happened afterward concerning the issue of the reliability of the evidence?**

A: The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll.

The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions. The most serious of which was that at the time that the Select Committee experts thought the shots were, [it] actually, [was] one minute after the assassination had actually taken place.

Dealey Plaza is a veritable echo chamber, and it makes it very difficult sometimes to analyze the acoustic testimony. However, by looking at the statements of a witness who gave an opinion as to the source of the shots, we can see certain trends.

Eighty-eight percent of the 179 witnesses who expressed an opinion said there were three shots and three shots only. The largest group that identified a location, 28 percent, said they came from the book depository. Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly don't see any holes in the Oswald theory. One of the books I read was *Oswald's Tale* by Norman Mailer, an exhaustive, 800+ page biography. By the time he was 24, Oswald had: joined the marines, gotten court-martialed, become a Marxist, defected to Russia, gotten married, moved back to the States, started a pro-Castro group, attempted to assassinate a General, shot the president and killed a cop. It was a crazy life that all points to a nobody who wanted to be a somebody and Kennedy's visit gave him the opportunity. Don Delillo probably put it best:



*"Oswald would not have walked two blocks to shoot at the president. The president had to come to him, and this is what happened, ruinously, on Nov. 22. This was an act of naked desperation. Oswald abandoned his claim to history and became the first of those soft white dreamy young men who plan the murder of a famous individual -- a president, a presidential candidate, a rock star -- as a way of organizing their loneliness and misery, making a network out of it, a web of connections."* </TEXT>

Conspiracies exist. Who killed David Kelly? Who killed Gary Webb? I don't know.

But you have yet to show me one single shred of evidence of any kind whatsoever. As I've said before, if Kennedy was killed by some conspiracy, it was the single most successful conspiracy in the history of mankind. So successful that every single piece of evidence about that conspiracy has been kept secret for 50 years. Not one single witness, not one piece of evidence has been revealed. That seems highly unlikely. </TEXT>

A: Critics claim that the bullet came through President Kennedy, hesitated for a second and a half in mid-air, deciding where to go, then made a right turn, went over and hit Governor Connally in the right shoulder, came out of his right nipple, made another right turn to move over and hit Governor Connally's wrist. Then when it came out of here, decided "Where should I go?" and made a left turn, a 90-degree turn, and went into his thigh. Four government commissions all concluded that's absolutely false, that, in fact, it was a straight line right through the two men.  </TEXT>

**On the night of Nov. 22, where is Ruby emotionally?**

I view Ruby as very agitated from the night of the assassination, Friday. It continues to build through Saturday. A number of events take place that sort of seem to propel him at even a faster rate into what I view as this emotional deterioration.

One of them is the belief that the Jewish community in Dallas is going to be blamed for the assassination, based upon an ad that had run the day the president arrived, signed by a Jewish name. Another is when he comes across a billboard that says, "Impeach Earl Warren." [He believes] that it may be part of a right-wing plot connecting the billboard to the anti-Jewish campaign, furthering his excitability.

The third is that he runs into a stripper and a policeman together in a car on Saturday night. They talk to him for about an hour, and they carry on that Oswald should be taken and quartered; that if it was England, he would be carried through the streets, and he would be dead.

Ruby gets very worked up into this very anti-Oswald feeling. He is really at the edge of this emotional stability by the time Saturday rolls into Sunday.  </TEXT>

**Q: Describe Lee Harvey Oswald's shooting ability.**

A: Just three weeks after joining the Marines, he's trained in the use of an M-1 rifle. He shoots on a rifle range [a score of] 212, which means he qualified for the second-highest position in the Marine Corps, that of a sharpshooter.

Near the end of his stay in the Marines in 1959, after being court-martialed twice and his morale was low, he went back to re-qualify himself in the range -- still shot a 191, and still qualified as a marksman. That meant that he could hit a 10-inch target eight times out of ten from 200 yards away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sigh. The big one. Here's the thing. If you shoot someone in the back of the head, the bullet hole going in is small. The shot coming out is big. The explosive force out of the front is going to push the head back.


From the [Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html) interview:

**Q: The head wound. Everyone looks at the backward motion of the president's head and says, "That's got to mean the shot came from the front and shoved the head back."**

A: When I first saw the Zapruder film, I thought that it was evidence of a shot from the front. ... I asked the experts, "What does that mean, that backwards head movement?" What they told me is, several things are happening. First, as the cortex of the brain is destroyed, a neuromuscular response shoots down the spine, sending a seizure through the body. The body's muscles twitch, with the large muscles in the back predominating.

Remember, Kennedy's wrapped into a back brace. It's wrapped right underneath his breast all the way down and wrapped around his legs. You can't tell from that seizure where he's going to move in the car. But then something happens. Out the right side of his head, an explosion takes place. On the [enhanced Zapruder film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPdBXh-ltaA), you can see a cloud, a red mist of brain and blood tissue moving forward. It's almost a jet effect. As that propels out his head, it has much more force than the force of the bullet moving in, and it shoots him in the opposite direction. It shoots out to the right front and left, violently.

Two things. As the president's brain is destroyed, he goes into a neuromuscular seizure. His body starts to stiffen up. At the same time that the wound explodes out the right front side of his head and as that blood and brain tissue moves out, it forces him in the opposite direction, the jet effect, back and to the left, violently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two weeks past his 17th birthday, yes. I'm not assuming he didn't start the confrontation, but there is no proof he did and, I think, plenty of proof of how aggressive Zimmerman was: "Fucking punks", "Assholes", driving around with a loaded gun, following Trayvon (even after he was asked not to). Only if you give Zimmerman every benefit of every doubt does his story make sense, which I won't do. Not with Trayvon dead.

The thing is, even if every aspect of Zimmerman's story is true and we believe every single thing he says, I still think he should go to jail. If we let Zimmerman go, then it's just open season on people. It means I can go around with a gun, provoke people, yell "Help!", kill them and then claim self-defense. That's insanity.

Saying your life is in danger after the fact doesn't make it so. A few scratches and a bloody nose doesn't make it so. I think Zimmerman overreacted and a boy is dead. He should suffer the consequences.

Even though usage of illegal drugs are roughly the same along racial lines, the Drug Policy Alliance Network shows that blacks constitute 13 percent of drug users, but are 38 percent of people arrested for drug offenses, and 59 percent of those convicted. The Human Rights Watch supported this claim as well, stating that of blacks convicted of drug crimes 71% are incarcerated, compared with 63% of convicted whites. US laws have a much higher penalty for possession and distribution of crack cocaine, a frequently used drug among African Americans and this affects the Black community as well." - Wiki

<TEXT> See, I just think you're giving Zimmerman way too much benefit of the doubt. The way you're presenting him is as a dutiful citizen going about his business and helping the neighborhood. From his comments about fucking punks and assholes always getting away and his suspicion of Trayvon (which in hindsight was 100% wrong), I think it's clear he's on the prowl looking for trouble. Why follow him? He was looking for trouble. Why have a gun? He's looking for trouble. If he was a neighborhood watch good guy, the police would've been called and that would be that. But Trayvon's dead and Zimmerman killed him, we can agree on that, and the idea that unarmed 16-year-old Trayvon posed such a threat that Zimmerman was within his rights to blow a hole in his chest is just absurd to me.

Frankly, if Zimmerman gets off scott-free, there *should* be riots in Florida. Black people are still second-class citizens in the U.S. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, it hasn't been settled. There are arguments on both sides. I think here is a clear case of reasonable doubt. The prosecution interpreted it as "fucking punks", you think it's "fucking cold", I think it's "fucking coons". Reasonable doubt.

[Prowl](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prowl): "To roam through stealthily, as in search of prey or plunder." That's what he was doing.

[Vigilante](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vigilante): "One who takes or advocates the taking of law enforcement into one's own hands." That's what he was.

[Fake-ass](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fake-ass): "Describing or pertaining to one's inability to accomplish their motives. When one tries to be something they are not." That one's from the Urban Dictionary, but I think it applies pretty well!

I am using that quote to show his frame of mind, not who initiated the confrontation. His frame of mind was clearly, obviously, already confrontational. As for Trayvon's "drug use", that's the weakest shit I've heard about this entire case. The idea that marijuana is at all relevant is just more pro-Zimmerman nonsense. Besides, whether or not he was "on drugs" is different than if he had marijuana in his system, and I understand the latter to be the case.

Watch the O'Donnell clip, it's good.

So, we just have to agree to disagree. I think it's unreasonable doubt. I think he's going to get off scott-free and Florida will explode. We'll see.

As an aside, you seem like a reasonable person, doesn't it bother you that you're throwing your lot in with the FOX News/Breitbart/anti-black crowd? They're pretty much wrong 100% of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the prosecution didn't use it, it's probably because they didn't think it was clear enough to help their case. That's not proof he didn't say it. Maybe he said goons? Maybe it was tunes? Maybe it was dunes? Maybe.

Zimmerman WAS on the prowl. He WAS a vigilante. He WAS a fake-ass cop. Those aren't emotional terms. They're facts. What else could you possibly call him? His own words condemn him. "This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something. These assholes, they always get away. These fucking punks." and, quite likely, "[fucking coons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IKKqnF0WlE)". (A different link than the previous one. Lawrence O'Donnell takes apart the argument that it's "goons.")

I think the "reasonable doubt" standard is what we disagree upon. To me, to suggest Zimmerman should get off scott-free could only be arrived at by invoking unreasonable doubt. </TEXT>

You're talking about one audio expert, I'm providing you with the fact that it was 16 degrees Celsius and he had a jacket on and the actual recording of what he said. You can continue to believe whatever you want, but I think you're stretching the facts past the breaking point. It wasn't cold and it's certainly possible, is it not, that he said coons? Surely there's some reasonable doubt there.

Again, he was on the prowl with a loaded gun and followed Trayvon, an altercation ensued and Trayvon is dead. Somehow, you're putting all of this together to the point of exculpating Zimmerman. You're not even allowing the possibility of him being responsible for the murder he committed. I haven't said any of those things about Trayvon, yet you're basically saying them about Zimmerman. Proud and noble defender of justice saving us all from the house-robbing darkies. More like fake-ass cop following people with a loaded gun who got in over his head and committed murder. But in America, you can get away with murder as long as it's black people you're killing. That's been true for a long time, and you refuse to see America's racial history as playing a part in this story. That's being willfully obtuse in my book.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I highly, highly doubt it sounds like cold to you. I think you can obviously hear him saying coons but your bias won't let you admit it. The thing is, it *wasn't* cold. [It was over 16 degrees Celsius at the time he made the call](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KSFB/2012/2/26/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Sanford req_state=FL req_statename=Florida) *and* Zimmerman had a jacket on! "Cold." Bullshit.

The whole issue of who made the confrontation physical is a matter of pure conjecture. Trayvon is dead so we only have one side of the story. You don't know who made it physical and neither do I. All we know is that a self-appointed vigilante driving around with a gun murdered an unarmed 16-year-old. The majority of people on reddit think he should get off scott-free. That's fucking insane.

I'm not making this racial, it is racial. Black people are disposable in the U.S. and have been for a long time. This is just another example of it. As I said, if Trayvon was white and Zimmerman was black, this case would be open and shut. That's America.

<TEXT> White men kill black men and black men kill white men all the time. The reason Trayvon's murder is getting play is because he was an unarmed 16-year-old murdered by a man who wasn't even charged at the time. They took his word for it and that was that. That is the value America puts on the life of black men. Hopefully all four of those black guys go away for a long, long time. But to suggest that America places more emphasis on white on black crime is absurd.

There is no reasonable doubt as to who blew a whole in Trayvon's chest. I also think that the guy driving around with a loaded gun following people is clearly the one making the confrontation physical. Only in America is the guy walking back from the store with Skittles the one to blame.

These assholes. They always get away." When the bitch-ass Zimmerman started getting his ass beat he went for his gun like a coward. Hope he goes away for life.

<TEXT> Fucking reddit. So smart when it comes to most issues, so fucking stupid when it comes to matters of race. You can't break a man's legs and then complain that he isn't running fast enough. Every single person who commits a crime is responsible for their actions and should be punished accordingly. I repeat, **every single person who commits a crime is responsible for their actions and should be punished accordingly** but if you don't know your history, you won't know why we are where we are. Of all our studies, history is best qualified to reward our research. I'm going to keep posting this video in every thread where reddit rears its knee-jerk racism:

Heathens will breed heathens so

Everybody's suspect I must check your ID

Cuz you lookin sheisty you might be intelligence

Someone that Del's against

Opposite or positive

When I drop the law against nature be faithful

Why should I hate you we ain't that different

We may act differen't in some ways

But we still grouped together like a fuckin survey

Sufferin and fuck em all's the motto

I'm trapped in a bottle

My music's gettin hollow

That's what happens when humanity you follow

Where every leak or info is hard to swallow

Sell your Marlboros and car insurance

Put niggas on the moon and can't pay your burdens

I smoke herb and rock a turban

Meditate on the world and whats occurrin

A lot of white boys like the style and copy

Dig in something deeper and youll peep that were not free

It's not about the seperation its about the population

<TEXT> "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it would be cooler if they decided that they needed two people because it was set up that only if they BOTH decide to do X, then X executes, i.e., throw a punch, lift up left leg, etc.. That way, they're connected and you get the "drift" thing, but then there's also a logical reason, some redundancy, they need both pilots to agree to do a certain action.

I see so many comments on reddit about how black people should just "pull themselves up by their own bootstraps" etc. etc. If they knew half of what is in this doc, they wouldn't make such ignorant statements. America has been working against African-Americans since day one, and as this documentary makes clear, very little has changed.

<TEXT> Again, I think you're trying to have it both ways. The law is stupid and unjust, and the prosecution was politically motivated....but really there's no problem because it was all legal. It's this vacillation I object to. Again, that it was in keeping with the law doesn't work because it was selective prosecution, re: the other seed distributors. I think this was without any doubt a strictly political maneuver and neither justice nor the law was served. 

And sorry, not be a dick, but you are being naive about the power structure behind the war on drugs. There are very, very powerful interests at work that have absolutely no interest in seeing marijuana decriminalized here and the economic repercussions would be so horrendous, no government could actually enact it up here. Being defeatist is acceptance of defeat without struggle. That's not what I'm advocating, the struggle should go on, but if you're not aware of just how powerful the anti-drug lobby is in the U.S. you're kidding yourself. I have to agree with David Simon, the U.S. drug war is a holocaust in slow-motion and if they're willing to live with that, what makes you think Canada is going to change their mind? We follow their lead because we have to.

<TEXT> Wait a minute, you can't have it both ways. Are you trying to claim that it was both politically motivated AND the case was pursued in the interests of justice? That's absurd. The arrest and conviction of Emery has, of course, done absolutely nothing to halt the marijuana or marijuana seed trade in the U.S., it was strictly done for political purposes and you clearly know that. If not, why didn't the DEA go after the Vancouver Seed Bank or Kind Seed or Vancouver Island Seed Company or Liberty Seeds? Well, when they get big enough, they will because it's politically motivated. Some prosecutor will be looking for a feather in their cap.

But back to my original point, you originally claimed that "Canada is a sovereign nation, the US can't disallow us from doing anything." But that's kind of naive, don't you think? The U.S. drug apparatus, from money laundering banks like HSBC to the police to the lawyers to the judges to the private prisons all have way too much at stake and will not allow Canada to mess that up. Which is why we HAVEN'T decriminalized marijuana in the last thirty years. We keep talking about it, but until the U.S. changes its mind, which it might eventually, we will follow the American lead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow. Never seen someone actually try to claim the Marc Emery case wasn't politically motivated. Not even the DEA Administrator who prosecuted the case:

"Today's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery, publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada, **but also to the marijuana legalization movement**."

Also, you're misunderstanding the case. He wasn't charged with any crimes in the U.S. all the alleged crimes occurred in Canada and police here never charged him with anything. This is about as clear a case as you can get of the U.S. drug policy trumping Canadian laws, whether you want to admit it or not.

<TEXT> I see what you're saying but pretty much the same thing can be said about lots of technology that reaches the consumer stage. It's a commercial application of an industrial technology that, in order to have mass appeal, specializes and reduces the capabilities of that original design. The technology in an iPad is actually pretty old. We've had a device that can be programmed to carry out a set of operations with a CPU and memory to run applications for a long time. But the innovation of the application of that technology counts for something. You could say the same thing about the iMac and compare it to a CRAY or whatever, you know what I mean. But the fact that 3-D printers are "crappy" cnc mills that use "shitty" mitres that only cut plastic is actually really important and definitely could have a serious impact on the way we produce goods. 3-D printers are "cheap" cnc mills that use "cheap" miters that use one of the most common and versatile substances on the market. That's very handy and, I hope, going to be cool! They'll constantly work to reduce the waste and improve it, but I think it looks very promising. I'm going to make my driverless Google car look like the Batmobile or something. Hopefully I can just download the plans!

<TEXT> Sadly, I think you're right, things are going to have to get worse before they get better. 'They' will fight and the fight will be ugly, but that's the only way things will, eventually, get better. How many more men will have to be destroyed by family "law" before we, collectively, wake up? Not sure, but marriage is certainly taking a serious hit and the more men that opt out the better

<TEXT> It occurs to me that the (disputed) Gandhi quote: "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." is very much applicable to the Men's Rights movement. Twenty years ago, the men's rights movement basically didn't even exist, or existed in a very small, marginalized form. Today, it seems as though we're transitioning from the "laugh at you" to the "fight you" stages. Make no mistake, it's still a marginalized movement, but it is a recognized movement that feminists now feel the need to fight (i.e. Warren Farrell at U of T). There are more people every day who are realizing that the current feminist-dominated culture simply isn't working. Let's keep it up.

The character is so well-realized it's easy to forget that there's even an actor there, all you see is the character. I will never get tired of him or this movie.

<TEXT> ...be defenseless in the face of one of the most cruel beasts that has ever taken a people into captivity. That's this American white man. And they have proved it throughout the country by the police dogs and the police clubs. A hundred years ago they used to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken off the white sheet and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs, and they're still doing the same thing. And just as Uncle Tom, back during slavery, used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhound, or resisting the Ku Klux Klan, by teaching them to love their enemy, or pray for those who use them spitefully, today Martin Luther King is just a 20th century or modern Uncle Tom, or a religious Uncle Tom, who is doing the same thing today, to keep Negroes defenseless in the face of an attack, that Uncle Tom did on the plantation to keep those Negroes defenseless in the face of the attacks of the Klan in that day." </TEXT>

I didn't really like Chasing Amy, I thought it had a few funny bits but was very pretentious...and the rest of his catalogue looks like one piece of shit after another. A lot of my friends agree, but he definitely has an audience he's tapped into who think he's really great. Can anyone explain?? </TEXT>
