<TEXT> There is a theory on /r/fantheories that makes a strong case that Robin is actually Jokers son. So heres what i suggest





Robin is fighting crime keeping Gotham in order. Bruce and cat woman living happy in london or where ever. Robin eventually finds out his dad is the Joker. Kills him at his trial, that way we never hear the joker so you could cast a lookalike. Robin then takes a turn for the worse, no longer being able to mask the anger hes always had inside, the anger he tells Bruce about.





He forces Batman and catwomans hand. They come back to save Gotham. After a long struggle, Robin kills Batman. Then an epic battle between robin and catwoman transpires. Catwoman wins,barely, and returns to London. Where in the final scene we see her nursing a young boy, bruce jr.

Although i thought the fight itself was a let down. Amsterdam only killing a wounded Bill was unsatisfing. I thought this scene could have been better. Maybe cutting the dance scene, the burning building they rob scene would have been better scenes to cut out imo </TEXT>

<TEXT> A shame you dont see more in the story of Avatar. An avid film fan you seem to be, there is so much more than eye candy. It highlights the flaws of the human race, it shows a world that has evolved without technology, has a wonderful love story, great characters in the brainy female scientist, hardenered war Captain, and the handicapped rebel. Makes powerful statements on war and the field of conscinoues. But if you cant see its more than eye candy i feel sorry for you as its such a joy.




How can the setting not be more original? Pandora is an orignal world. Cmon now. The theme and conflict in TWBB are very much the same as the Godfather and endless movies about rise to power. The characters and acting(didnt mention) are better but one film has DDL one doesnt so that shuts the case on those 2 aspects.




Again i love TWBB, but wish you could see more in Avatar. People tend to get lost in the CGI and not focus on the wonderful story or concepts. Sling blade doesnt even come close imo  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The end speech between Borden and Angier. Angier begins to tell Borden of shooting the first clone but there is a major inconsistency.




Angier is all alone in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. There is no Tesla or his assistant, as to imply they have already fleed Edisons men. But Edison burns the lab down that night. Only after Tesla flees does Angier have solo use of the machine.





Angier couldnt have gone to the lab alone beforehand, due to the electric fence. Nor do we ever see him there without Teslas company. So he couldnt be there alone beforehand alone and he couldnt be there after the machine was given to him, the lab has been burned down.




There are 3 possibilities. 




1)Ive missed something here and someone can make sense of this inconsistency.(possible although unlikely)





2)Nolan made a mistake.





3)Its a clue Angier is lying in this moment.





Lmk what you all think or what ive missed.




EDIT: i was wrong it does look like the scene is elsewhere than the lab. will leave the post up to rebutt the crazy suggestion there was two machines </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes you do. When you consider yourself right when you are clearly wrong thats a childish thing to do. Its not about your missused burning ship analogy, its about someone coming along and correcting your mistakes. When they do you accept the mistake, learn from it, and move on. You dont hold on to your mistake and now treat it as truth.





This is the way mature people deal with mistakes. But again like a child you want to hold on the notion im "righter" Lol. Unlike me i saw my mistake and said yep i stand corrected, grow up a little and accept the idea you will not always be right, you wont. Even Einstein was wrong, alot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it was great. A nice change for Scorcese as well.





I saw it as Leo was really crazy. His partner was his docter,etc, and it was an attempt to try and cure him. At the end he realizes he is potentially cured but instead of living with the pain hed rather be lobtomized. He says something like, "Live as a murderer or Die a good man." I believe his relapses dealt with him running from the pain of his murdered wife and kids. Thats how i saw it. </TEXT>

Your only response was some bias racist crap that made no sense, and directly reflects the type of mindset whites still have in this country as proof enough AA is nessicary.

Someone has to be a minority someone has to be the majority. Its a technicality you are hanging on, if blacks were the majority AA would apply to whites. Its a number of population of race thing not a color thing. </TEXT>

So if AA is so unfair, why are whites still the least unemployed but most of the population? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it has to do with minority, yesterday you had no idea it lent itself to women. This country is the most diverse we have to incourage equal opportunities. So 50 years is suppose to even out the 200 years minoritys didnt get to vote work, or were slaves?





If you were to employ every black person in America that would only leave 2% of whites unemployed. Yet with being a majority whites have the least unemployment, hence level the playing field. If we have 100 people 70 are white 30 are black 60 whites are employed only 10 blacks. Thats are country break down, to imply this is level is ignorant and just wrong. And this is with 50 years of AA lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its to level the playing field. Blacks are still the most unemployed, women still make less than 1$ average than males for the same job. This country has only recently given equal rights to these groups, so outside help is needed. This policy has evoked positive change in culture and mindsets. You do realize it has very little to do with race. If whites were the minority it would serve them. Furthermore we are not the only country to adapt this policy.

<TEXT> You are retarded, you understand that the FBI wasnt involved right away as you suggest? Nor does that mean the FBI falsified anything in this case? Your article pertains to less than 100 cases, are you saying the FBI only dealt with 329 cases of DNA since forensics came around overturning less than 100? Furthermore your article mentions nothing about SHOES, its alot easier to identify a shoe print to a specific shoe than hair or bite marks to a specific person. Even your childish mind can see that difference. To claim a shoe print is the same catergory as hair or bite marks shows your ignorance. One can look at the PIC today and run a simple test to prove what kind of shoe it is. 





Your only evidence is a pin LOL, compared to the evidence against OJ, you really are an idiot, what about the witnesses, unexpained cuts on his hand, his bronco gone from the premise at the time of the murder, you are aware OJ has an alibi shortly before and after the murders but not during while a limo driver was beating down his door so he wasnt at home, the BRONCO chase scene and suicide note, unexplained cuts on his hand and his confession in book form, this is without mentioning DNA or motive???? you holding onto a pin LOL




I know this case much better than you. There is much more proof than a shoe print, including a ton of it not dealing with forensics but again their not RODGERs size as you conveinantly havent addressed. Plus you just make shit up like OJ not owning a pair of the shoes, knowledge doesnt come from making shit up and bad info from a bias documentary lol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A)Of course there is proof. He admits this in the civil case





B)Your one article presented does not say shoe prints. Ir we assume thats what it meant, you are ignoring the rareity and condition of the shoe print




C)You do realize there is more evidence than DNA and prints





D)Why would he lie, obvious. Publicity, money, fame, boredom, insane.




E)The FBi may have introduced evidence in court its the Lapd who collected it. Specifically the gloves and blood samples. It was the LAPD who drew OJs blood days after the murder.




F)No i am testing the range of your conspiracy. But you have to see a connection here.





G)this is true policd have framed before. The evidence is so vast in this case that there was justification in stopping the investigation 





First, cmon with those childish comments "if you knew anything bout the case". No need for that, also you were wrong in that statement. We are having a decent debate but no room for that.




Also can you address the FBI admitting to falsing facts or some proof. </TEXT>

B)if rogers didnt need money why he is comiiting a double murder? If he is a successful criminal why would he wear rare shoes to a murder scene? You still havent adressed it wasnt his shoe size




C)no im not FBI but the evidence as well as the whole trial is documented so.....




D)OJ lied at a voluntery questioning before he was a suspect, plus why lie about Your Own Shoe collection if you hired someone else to do it? And rodgers is incapable of lying right




E)So you think its more crediable a mass conspiracy between the LAPD and the FBI was commited to frame OJ? You do realize the amount of different departments and people that dont intermingle would have to work together on this right




F)did the FBI fake the many incidents of OJs physical abuse against Nicole? And the infamous 911 call?




G)so OJ was clever enough to hide any connection to Rodgers but not clever enough to have an alibi? Lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea 99.9% of those cases didnt involve an extremely expensive shoe where there were only 500 pairs or less at the time. Even less when you consider the size. Furthermore OJ lied about owning a pair, not only does his lying have a significant impact but why would a poor desperate for money Rogers be wearing those shoes? Its not his size either from what i understand.




Also very rarely is the print found in such prestine condition, so your rebuttal very well said does not hold alot of weight considering

<TEXT> Yes i agree, people are reaping the benefits now that have no true idea why, and are privelged by it. Is it doing more harm than good now a days, i could agree with that. I hope to see this removed or changed in the future to include those in the majority that are hindered in other ways other than color. I do feels it adds to the lingering feeling of most blacks that most whites are racist, hence why there is AA, some would say.





But it has helped in positively effecting change imo. It was a positive thing upon its being implemented. I believe it had a direct effect on the culture change since that of the 60s. I also feel blacks are still the minority as far as population and see AA as a way to level the job searching playing field.





I have the biggest issue with job programs for inmates. Those who can leave jail to work in the real world. It hinders the average "free" citizens job opportunities by a decent amount. Since most inmates are black its a privelege rarely touched on, and a spit in the face of equal opportunity imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair AA goes beyond slavery, and has to do with equal rights that were fairly recently made into a level playing field.




I understand where you are coming from though. I simply support AA because its an attempt to level the mind set caused by this very long history of unfairness to blacks. Is it in turn unfair to whites? Yes. Anyone who says it isnt is wrong. Is it nessacary to implement changes in cultures and mind sets? This is debateable but imo yes it is.




You make great points on other immigrants discriminated on. Take the irish for another case. But most of these immigrants had equal rights not offered to the blacks. Thats the difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean he is the one of the best to me, which was the question. To me Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction, Djano Unchained, and Inglorius Bastards is some of the best films ever made. So that solidfies his status to me.




Diverse is overrated. If Kubrick can make a great scfi flick and great comedy but Tarantino makes two great action flicks, they both made 2 great flicks. I dont give one the edge because one was more diverse. Plus quention has done horror, martial arts, 2 period pieces, action, etc he is very diverse imo.





Very rarely do all great directors also write their scripts, everytime. This alone puts him high on the list. Some may be a better technical director but Tarantino has a style all to his own, you cant watch 5 mins of anything he directs and not know its him. This has to be respected. I dare you to find a director who has done so much with so little, in a time when so much more is available.




He could not put out another movie wouldnt change my opinion. Its not about diversity or quanitity or even technicality, its about Quality. Every movie he has put out, except 1 imo, has been top knotch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An opinion has always existed, most people then think the jurors were idiots and same as now. Although i have seen polls as of 2014/15 that showed the majority of blacks believe he is guilty, directly the opposite to polls after the trial. With the increase of believers its reasonable to assume more have accepted the widely presumed theory that the jurors were morons, hence recent times.




I also dont think the jurors final decision is always right although in this case they were based on the cases presented before them. Had the evidence been presented properly and the verdict was still not guilty i would consider the decision wrong and the jurors morons. </TEXT>

Not to mention DNA was relatively new and hard to understand. This process should not have been the focus or jammed down the jurors throats. Considering the mountain of evidence they had they should have presented a mountain, instead of a hill of DNA evidence. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Silmarillion. Tolkien's subtle prediction on String theory and the Selfish gene. +Brief history </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 03:11:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I will start with, Tolkien began writing The silmarillion before the Hobbit and LOTR. He was a language addict, he spoke 12 or more languages and studied ancient ones. Eventually creating his own. He wanted to create a world where the creations in it spoke this language, hence the Silmarillion. This was his original motive. After years of work, with many pauses in progress due to in his academic work this novel was put to the side but it is the first work of ME, and predates all others. He then wrote The hobbit for his children to enjoy, using the universe he had already created but not yet finished. Upon the sucess of the Hobbit and fan request he began LOTR. Always coming back to the Silmarillion but never completeing it. So.....




In the silmarillion, it predates the LOTR's and the Hobbit beginning at the start of the universe. In his telling of the beginning of everything, it starts with an ominpotent Being,Eru. He creates the Holy ones, which he thens sings songs too which starts off the creation of the world, and Middle Earth.





Very much like String theory, which is compared to musical notes and their different frequencies. With the process explained here, Eru creates the strings and then begins to create the universe with them by singing and using different frequencies.





Eventually one of these Holy ones, starts to rebel and tries to instill competition amoung the rest. This holy ones' rebel wants to create different frequencies and rule over all. This could be seen as the early formation of the Selfish gene. He rebels against Eru with selfish ambition and trys to take over. Eru refuses to destroy the rebel as he loves all his creations. Instead he bans him to ME, which he eventually effects everything. The selfish gene thrives and even creates creatures. By the time the source is sent back to Eru, the gene has inhabited and infected everyone and everything.





A little loose but it does have some merit imho. When i first heard of String theory and its comparison to music i thought of Tolkien. He couldnt have possibly known about String theory but stumbled upon this explanation. There has to be something that lead him to favor this way for the universe to start, gut feeling maybe or blind luck. Im not saying string theory is correct either.





What do you all think? Open to suggestions </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Prestige. The end scene, debunked, maybe. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 02:13:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Spoiler Alert. The end speech with Borden and Angier. I believe i have found a major clue to Angier's deceit in narrarated scenes and evidence to stregthen the machine doesnt work theory. When Angier is telling Borden about the 1st clone ive noticed a major inconsistency that would lead me to believe its proof or a subtle clue that Angier is lying.





When he shoots the 1st clone, in the flashback at the end, its in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. You do not see Tesla or the assistant in the lab as to suggest they have already fleed Edison's men. Edison's men burn down the lab right after they flee. Only then does Angier have solo use of the machine, after the Lab has been burned down. There is no logical way for Angier to have been in the Lab alone, its guarded by electrical fences and gadgets to keep Edison's men away, before Tesla flees. There is no logical way for Angier to be there after its burned down.






The scene shows Angier kill the first clone in Teslas lab. With no tesla or his assistant, during daylight. This implies its after he has been given the machine, after Tesla flees. This would be impossible since the Lab has been burned down at this point.





This is a direct clue that Angier is lying. It also solidifies his willingness to fabricate stories to Borden, giving credence to a made up diary. Pair this with the air bubble in the only visible tank, and Angier seemingly gaining full control of his damaged leg, these are some of the subtle, ambigious clues we are told watch closely for.





Im fairly certain this scene is a clue and doesnt make sense. Imho Angier is lying as he is about the machine. This is Nolan masking the true trick of the film well. Want to see what you all think about this scene and if im not missing anything i might post a revised theory on the machine. Lmk if this wasa  great catch or why im wrong.  </TEXT>

It's about a family with a struggling marriage and a "special" son. The hotel is fueled by Danny and its ghost convince jack to kill the family. That's about it. Kubrick also does some crazy stuff. He shoots every scene from eye sight level and you almost feel like you are a ghost following around the Torrance family. He rearranges the carpet, fixtures, pictures on the wall, mid scene and all kinds of things. It's a very dark movie but filmed in a very neat way. </TEXT>

To add to it, this is how the end could play out. The older brother after having come to terms leAving earth is the best possibility, long drawn out process in the film, decides to help Edmund. With his pull from being a war hero in a time after the war in a broken country, he helps sustain funding for the missions. He helps to fund and set up funds for the Lazarus mission in his attempt to rekindle his relationship with Edmund(younger brother). He becomes close to Dr. Brand waiting to hear back from Edmund, like Matthews' daughter does in interstellar. 




Upon getting close to Brand he figures out that Plan A is useless, that the Human race cannot be saved and his brother Edmund was sent under the wrong pretenses. Upon finding this out he confronts Dr Brand, and things get out of hand. Dr brand ends up shooting the older brother, as he lay there dying he begins to recite a poem to brand , one which he has never heard "Do not go gentle into the that dark night. Rage rage against the dying of the light........" The movie ends with dr brand standing over the body in his office, breathing heavy digesting the mans last dying words, the screen goes black..........then we hear the oldest brother take his last breath and utter the last words in the poem, Rage Rage. Then a baddass tune kicks in and the credits roll </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea that could have some effect, reading the book. But take in mind the change in time frame to the book. This would greatly help Nolan in masking the trick, as far as the legal system, the trial, the use of simple magic. It is also my understanding tesla was also added, he was not in the book. Which would lend to help Nolan disguise the trick. But I'm not sure about that Lmk what is the truth here.





I will leave you with a quick version of the theory, but keep in mind it's got much more details and evidence then this. But it should help you rewire yourself into viewing the movie from angiers pov when you rematch the movie.




Angier visits tesla and realizes he has no " magic". He has no working machine as when he had none when Borden visited. So he begins to devise a plan to frame Borden, not just kill him but ruin his reputation, even steal his daughter. But he has a major problem, Borden has ruined his reputation when he sabatoges his trick and double. Borden's second successful attempt to sabotage Angier. No one would hire Angier for some simple trick.




So he uses the fact Borden sends him to tesla. He uses this useless machine to add flair to the old transported man to give the illusion of " real magic". Enough to add him a spot for a theater and give him efficient amount of time to set the frame in play. So Angier spends these months " visiting tesla" preparing his frame up and sobering up  root. A now very well paid root which was the sum of his issues anyway, money. Remember Angiers motive is not good magic at this point it's only to frame Borden. So if he was trying to top Borden at this point, root would not be a good hire but it's not he is only trying to frame Borden. This also why the blind stage hands, and why Caine is never let back stage. He is even scolded in a scene when he tries.




So Angier is the pledge and turn and all root does is the prestige( coming out the top of the balcony) that's it. 





Again there is abunch more to it, dealing with the tanks and bodies etc. but I'm tired of typing. If you are interested in the rest Lmk and I'll finish it later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1)you have to remember that Borden is caught red handed. No one suspects foul play here. And I disagree that forensics was more or even considered sophisticated at all in the the time frame of the movie. So for no reason for anybody to suspect anything there would be no extensive investigation. There are blind stage hands backstage and the only person who saw was Caine who catches a longtime rival red handed with plenty motive. This was the classic open shut case, then take in the legal system of the time.



2)I understand your points but to me it's a little contradictive to portray what real magic is what it takes and have it switched on you. This doesn't make sense to me.




3)sure the bubbles could be interpreted as anything. But they took the extra effort to cgi it in, or purposely not take it out. I believe this has more significance than is widely considered.



4)this diary is also given to Angier on purpose by Borden. The encryption is planned ahead of time, because he willingly gives Angier the diary.



5)well when Angier shoots the clone you do not see Tesla or his assistant in the lab. This would imply it's being used after tesla has given him the machine, when tesla flees Edison's men. I believe a direct clue to lend you to believe Angier is lying.





6)I agree interpretation can be done many ways. Although my assesment is people are missing the obvious. Just as Angier does to Borden, just as Borden does to Angier, and as Nolan is doing to the audience. 




On the edit, true this can be taken many ways as can the bubble. But instead of thinking its a mindless error or poor calculation, in the theory these become vital clues.




Your post was well said many good points although I feel if you look at the movie different you will see my side. Might not agree but there is validity in my points IMHO 





Edit. To the birds point. The birds are killed and replaced with doubles not clones. Furthermore Angier figures out a way to save the birds, save the original. Only when Borden comes along does the bird get killed. Very similar to the way it plays out in the theory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ill start with the incosistancies.




1)Angier gives Borden a diary that could prove his innocence days before he is to be executed. A day or two before he actually goes to the jail




2)The movie makes constant references to how real majic is done and it has nothing to do with "real magic"




3)The air bubble in the only visible tank at the end. The fact Angier gains full control of his leg while drowning after the film goes though length to show how damaged it is




4)Borden sends Angier to Tesla the one person who can produce a similar result as a twin is unbelieveable and could have been done a much more logical way. Why connect these two if there is no need to?




5)The scene where Angier shoots the first clone, the flashback at the end, happens in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. A fabricated scene in the theory




Angier uses a double, and sets up the trick during his "visits with tesla". Caine identifies the double in the morgue, with a quick glance ill add. At this point there is no reason for suspicion. They have a body and have his long time rival caught red handed. Caine during the trial is under the impression the trick was real and Angier isd ead. He is never let in on the trick and its why he particapates in the trial.




I can give more detail lmk. But you have to be willing to accept Nolan is attempting to pull the wool over your eyes, and if you follow the clues you will see. </TEXT>

With Nolan playing the true trick on the audience and its what we are told to look for twice, "Are you watching closely? But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real." Said before and after Bordens trick is revealed




There are too many inconsistencies in the plot for it to be a straightforward film, with much evidence pointing to Angier deceit, IMHO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im glad you liked it. I was also thinking this for the oxygen situation but wasnt sure if i should add it. This is based on some documentary i watched that said there are things such as bacteria and viruses far out in space that we might not be aware of. Stating it is plausible an asteroid could carry such in its nooks and crannys.






Before the war, a decent size asteroid containing the blight hits earth. Not one nearly as massive as the one that killed the dinos but big enough to discombobulate the atmosphere. It lands somewhere on land, causing massive dust storms and causing detstruction to the atmosphere and oxygen. Then my theory would come a few years down the line after the blight is discovered. They also mention asteroids in the "Science of Interstellar" a documentary made during the filming, about being a possible reason for humans having to leave earth before the sun cuts out.

<TEXT> The prestige, and the theory behind the machine. Most are so convinced it works they fail to give the theory a fair shot. The movie is complicated enough but when you add the theory people tend to shut down. They view the theory with prejudged bias on what they have already made their mind up on. Alot of the issues that are brought up against the theory itself are not even related to the machine but with the movie regardless. For ex, people dont catch Caine is showing the Judge the box in the beginning. When he calls tesla a wizard this is during the Trial, and he is under the assumption Angier is dead and the trick is real. This is true regardless of the machine working.




After watching this movie close to 30 times, and knowing the movie better than anyone ever should im convinced this is the best kept secret in film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spoiler Alert. I think there is a fair amount of evidence to suggest there was a war before the events of the movie take place. It would seem the war was fought over resources that are becoming scarce due to the blight. Although the reason for the war and the starting point are not clear. Ill give my theory as to what i believed happen in this scenario although this is in no way Concrete, and I will end with the evidence in the movie which is.





At some point the blight takes form and starts to slowly do its inevitable damage. Starts to take out crops, lessen the air supply, and the ensuing data is not pretty. The worlds' powers try to respectfully communicate and try to work together for a solution. Intially, trying to save the world and its enviroment, and employing all resources to this solution.




At some point this happy family breaks down. Resistance inside the powers' meetings is small almost futile at first, eventually leading to all out war. Pandamonium is set loose and the common human is now worried about food and life. The war breaks out between the whole world, with the major powers splitting into teams. The fight is over resources and what policy(s) should be followed to protect such. Drones in the Usa are sent to protect and monitor the major crops. Around this time is when the wormhole is spotted, as said in the movie the wormhole was known about for 50 years at the time the movie takes place. Took about 40 years upon discovery to send the Lazarus missions.





As surviving the war became priority number 1, research to earths solution takes a back seat. Resources are not only affected by the blight but the lack of focus on them. Everything within reason is turned into to producing results for the war. Some point during the war the wormhole is discovered, but soon after Usa asks Nasa to drop a massive bomb from space(supported in the movie). Nasa refuses and gets shut down. Except for a small facility working on the wormhole.





Eventually the war and the vastly disappearing resources have wiped out enough people the only option left is for the majority to start producing food, ie farmers. There are not enough people to fight, and the blights' problem over time has become clearer. Food and crops need to be the main focus its our key to immediate survival. Focusing on the Usa, the vast population become farmers. Schools main focus are to lure the brightest minds in this field to have a higher production rate, and find a successful combatant food source to the blight. All the while Nasa knowing the Earth will have to be abandoned. While the vast majority of the public is not fed this idea.





10 years before the movie, the Lazarus mission takes place after 40 or so years of understaffed secretive research has been performed. At this point Dr Brand is fine tuning his Plan A. Eventually realizing this couldnt work but not wanting to deter people keeps Plan A as a possibility but focuses on Plan B. Once receiving data back a few years after the Lazarus missions have been sent, the training for Interstellar begins. Then before the team sets off for their new mission an unexpected visitor shows up with a small child.





A few things that support the idea of a war, but not nessecarily like i proposed it. I was just offering a theory to how. These hints do lye within the movie itself.





1)The drone in the early stages of the movie is treated like common place. They are excited to see it but not perplexed or scared by its presence. One could assume a vast amount of drones were deployed to protect the crops. And with a war that ended due to insanely high casualties and lack of resources the drones were not all properly taken down or accounted for.





2)The school trys to recruit Matthews' son as a farmer. Also the changing of the schools history book about the moon landing. This would suggest some major fall out with Russia and/or More likely part of a smear campain against Nasa, who refused to drop bombs.




3)Matthew takes his kids to a baseball game, offers the comment when i was younger we were too worried about fighting to play baseball.





4)Dr Brand while first visting with Matthew, confesses Nasa's refusal to drop a massive bomb which led to its being shutdown.





5)Matthew makes a comment aboard the space ship, its a crazy thought to think this ship could have been bullets.





6)Matthew refers to TARS in their first meeting as an ex marine robot. Also saying there is no need for robots like him anymore






7)Matthews' character is revered for his flying ability, much like that of a decorated war veteran. He even confirms he has never been out of the stratosphere but is highly regarded as a phonomenal pilot. He also handles himself well under Damons' attack. Also very much like a trained fighter he keeps his composure in intense moments and is willing to leave his family to do greater good.






Will add as i go and am open to suggestions. Lmk what you guys think

<TEXT> They do believe in Jesus and Moses but they are not of the same importance as they are in the bible. Mohamed is basically there Jesus. 




The Islamic faith has had over 100,000 prophets maybe more, Jesus and Moses were just one of the many. Allah sent prophets to each people throughout history. Allah sent Mohamed as a proheptic messenger for all mankind not just a specific people. 



Your original premise might be right, I'm really not sure about that. I just wanted to clarify a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course he considers root, but when you add the machine and the mysterious tanks he cannot figure out what's going on. All Angier needs to do is confuse Borden enough to get him backstage, and Borden has no Scarlett to lead him to root this time. 




You have to see the similarity in Angier refusing to accept Scarlett telling him Borden is using a double. She produces some of his disguises and tells him she has seen the double. Angier refuses to believe this. Yes it's Borden doesn't use a double but a twin but it's the same principle, Angier refused to admit there were two he was convinced Borden was pulling off the trick somehow solo.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im sorry but you are mistaken. Borden and Angier are seen with Tesla together. They both go to Teslas showing of the Ac current months before Angier visits. We know Tesla exist and Borden confirms at the end that he sends Angier on a wild goose chase. Only the scenes narrarated by Angier to Borden are fabricated, there are both attempts to blind Borden. Borden gives Angier the diary and for all purposes sends him to tesla. He tells Angier tesla is the key to my diary but not the key to my trick, which leads Angier to tesla. 




Remember Angier gives Borden the diary. Borden gives Angier his diary. Both are tools of deceit. Even if the machine works, Borden doesnt know the tesla can build a machine like that. By sending him to tesla in his mind, he is sending him to a useless bloke. By bordens' own admission he sends Angier there on a wild goose chase. Bordens' diary is also useless, Tesla is the key but it doesnt contain anything useful. Angier gives Borden the diary to have him go to the grave thinking he sent him to the one man that lead to his demise. This also sets up Lord Caldlow a chance to show Borden he has his daughter and tear up his prestige . The diary also proves the man at the jail truly wants Borden secrets to allow the set up of Lord Caldlow appearace, this is narrated in an early scene. It was written for Borden and fabricated.




Two things, you believe Angier gives Borden a diary that could prove his innocence days before his execution? Then show up at the jail? Are we as the audience to believe Borden sends Angier to the one man that can produce a similar result to a twin? 




When Caine calls Tesla a wizard, remember he leaves Angier before the Tesla trip, he is showing the Judge how the trick works. This is during the trial of Borden. Caine is still under the impression the "magic" was real and Angier is dead. Its only after these events he finds Lord Caldlow and the Judge leads him there. Only then does Caine figure out Angiers' game, so he is being truthful at this point.I disagree with your nolan narration assesment but Caine for sure would fit there.



There are not alot of scenes im implying are fabricated. The timeline in the movie is quite hard to follow and i believe the heart of some of your misstatements. Caine also narrates over the hat shots twice "Are you watching closely. But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real."

<TEXT> 1)No, he is there to identify the body. Why do you assume Caine thinks foul play. He is never let backstage during the new transported man. There is a scene when he gets scolded for trying to pry backstage. He is also fed the tesla story that Borden is, he believes Angier has found real magic. He believes Angier is being transported. He knows Angier didn't come out at the other end, caught Borden red handed and has a body, why would he be suspicious.



This point is there regardless of the machine working or not. Angier and Borden are caines friends, he mentors both. Caine taking in effect of Borden's daughter would never have participated in the trial, had he known what was going on.




2)This is true whether the machine works or not. Once Caine visits lord callow and finds Borden's daughter, he alerts Fallon because of angiers betrayal. 




3)again Angier had the money to pay root whatever to keep him happy knowing there was a limited show and he would be dealt with very soon. Again angiers motive is not to have a great magic show here, he only wants revenge on Borden. So hiring root if the magic was the motivation wouldn't make a lot of sense but he is only trying to frame Borden now.




Also I believe Scarlett Johnson is the one who leads Borden to root, Borden didn't find riot unassisted. 




4)well leaving roots body is what is risky. Caine had just been to his house and figured out his game. Requiring body's in the time frame the movie takes place is quite easy, medical reasons etc. considering caldlows immense wealth this is very plausible. 




Angier knows he has to rid of the tanks and warehouse. He buys root to tie up loose ends. How do you move a body across town? Well in the tanks you have purchased from angiers estate. So that's why he's in a tank. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1)Caine quickly looked at a decomposing body. He had no reason to expect foul play at that point. Not to mention he is quite old and looked down for a couple seconds at that. He believed Angier to be dead, no reason to go out of his way to really suspect the body wasn't there. He saw him drown and knew he didn't come out for the prestige that night. He is also Borden's friend and never would have participated in the trial had he known Borden was not guilty. Also the reason Caine leads Borden to Angier to get his revenge. 




2)it might have been another double but yes I believe it was root. Roots problem was money, that's what caused his downfall. Angier did not want to pay him a large salary forever as he was a small part of the act. But knowing he was going to kill him in a limited show it can be assumed this was fixed. Not to mention the months he spent with "tesla" and the time it took to build up the theater, quite reasonable to assume the issues were fixed.



Furthermore he only needed him to come out at the top of the balcony, for the whole show he just needed that. He wasn't depended on that much. He had a small role and would be dealt with in a small amount if time. It's also quite genius as everyone knew he used a double years before, but wouldn't suspect it at the trial given the way it ended. 





3)I have already adressed why he had to store the tanks. And we only see one clear body on purpose. This was root, who was recently placed in the tank which explains the very clear air bubble in this tank.



Angier has acquired root and plans to burn the whole place down ridding of any evidence. Angier rigs the place to burn not Borden. He simply intervenes kills Angier then finishes the job.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Prestige. The machine does not work, movie explained. Spoiler alert. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-15 01:22:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Will start with this, the machine not working is not suppose to be obvious. It is like the magic tricks in the movie, the trick is not easy to spot, it's difficulty leads you to believe its real. The trick is there to fool the audiences into believing the trick is real. The machine not working is the ultimate trick. The film alludes to there being no real magic many times, it's dedication and sacrifice that makes a true magic trick. What shows more dedication and sacrifice then dedicating the movie to actually masking this trick properly and sacrificing the real story of the movie by masking it inside a trick.



The prestige is a great movie. Some of the previous submitted theories miss a few points and a couple just posed questions. I'm going to submit the details behind how the trick was done with a double. There are before and after aspects of the theory but I will leave that to the discussion below, because this thread will be too long. And those aspects can easily be explained below with back and forth dialogue.





Will start the theory with the diaries, specifically angiers diary. Angier gives Borden who is sent to death, and will die in a short amount of time a fabricated diary. As is stated in the last sentence of the diary, which Borden reads aloud as he gets to the end. The tesla visits are fabricated, the whole point of the diary is to prove to Borden Angiers help sent to the prison has indeed bought angiers estate and wants to buy his secret. This set ups angiers visit to Borden as lord callow to torture him one last time by tearing up his prestige and to show he has his daughter. This also gives clear motive for Angier in his dying speech to lie as a dying man as he has lied already been proven to lie to a dying man. 




So Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no "magic". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs "real magic" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work.







Angier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater. 




At the end Angier continues his lie because Borden has two elements to critize angreir on. Theses two elements are the most important to Borden and this is what makes him the better magician. Crowd applause and sacrifice. In angiers trick he has none of these elements. So as he is dying he must convince Borden he has these two elements. He lies about killing the clones(sacrifice) and he lies about taking the applause, trying to convince Borden before he dies he is the better magician. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, leave stuff out but dont write a new story and ending. You can stay true to the key themes and not diveate as much as was done. If you cant figure how to condense the story properly dont call it monte cristo, hence why it was a bad movie that deserves a remake.



You say there are many stories to be told in the book. Exactly my point there is too much material in this book to add your own plot. How does having too much material justify adding your own material?




Take the sword fight i like btw. Edmund doesnt kill him like that he forces him to commit suicide. But being on a time budget this change makes sense. Its not the same but the Result is. I can like and understand changes need to be made liie this but not ones where the result is not the same or ones made to retell the plot




Alot of the changes i mentioned take time away to add fabricated parts instead of using this time to focus on a proper portrayal of the plot. 




The movie is decent if it were not called monte cristo. But it is it and does a retelling hatchet job to the story. Its a classic for a reason. Hence this is a poor telling of the classic and needs a proper remake. I think david fincher would be great fort his





BTW, i think the main theme is Dantes learning at the end his revenge was wrong. He should not have acted as providence, the actual count of the mountain of christ(monte cristo). God will judge them and he shouldnt have. Given forgiveness and religious themes the biggest in the story imo, just another tragedy of this terrible intrepertation </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. All the changes being made they could have changed the characters names and it could have been called a different movie. The only change that was reasonable was the sword fight.



Way more changes btw, edmund never meets napoleon, he doesnt kill the warden, no beach fight, the whole second half of the movie was fabricated.

<TEXT> Its pointless in the fact it, residuals, have no effect on why they would continue making movies after sucessfull ones. Your first reply was a technicality in this reference frame.





Your second was to confirm opinion on most actors receiving residuals which was to my comment most actors do not. Taking into effect all the extras small roles, etc in tv film and independent, it is more reasonable to assume that most do not. This also irrelavant imo.




Again if residuals is a small sum, it would have no effect on the topic at hand. I feel instead of trying to catch me on a technicality, which has no real bearing on the topic, just make your own post that goes directly to OP, so imo unproductive as we are literally back to where we started, but to each his own.




Furthermore my example, were you aware beforehand if the Godfather was a union shoot? </TEXT>

Bad movies usually will overpay big names to get people to watch the movie. Sometimes sucessful actors try to expand their horizon and try new genres they are unfamilar with and pick a shiity movie in their ignorance. Actors could sign on to a movie with a great script and the director bombs. In jack and jill maybe it was a favor to sandler </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough. I could give a couple reasons for you but mostly system is flawed.





1 Ever get fired as a head coach and take a new offer else where? When you do your upcoming free agents are all unhappy(w/e it is they say when a player rejects your contract and cant be offered another one). So to say the computer rarely offers big money to these players, and replaces them with new ones, there are exceptions dealing with age and pos. Also notice some of the biggest FAs can be picked up on one year deals after the draft, first FAs group after




2.When you start moving picks around, teams are more likely to use those picks to fill needs as opposed to FA, and also teams take this into account with expiring contracts




3.All contracts in madden are front loaded. Meaning the later years of the contract is when you pay the most money so the first 3-4 years can be a breeze cap wise before a clean house process is forced and does happen </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean come on use your imagination, but here is a few





1.Disliked tyson




2.Money on the fight




3.Money on the round it would end in, not specifically the fighters




4.a much more memorable fight with tyson losing, having him in the spotlight




5.he was tired, ready to go home




6.Money on tyson getting knocked out, which was probaly like a 1000 to 1




7.Paid off by douglass





On and on. Im not saying it was melicous but its a possibility. He might of just made an error. But to say tyson got the same count and time to get up is easily debunked by the tape, its an obvious difference. Half a second can be a world of difference to a boxer in that situation, and its a more than half a second difference. Again im not a big tyson fan, but a big boxing fan and there is concern about the difference in counts that ruin the fight for me.





If you like the big upset aspect of a fight as you said in your first post, look into Rumble in the Jungle, Ali wasnt even supose to Survive the fight, thats literally what they said. There was major concern for his well being. The KO is the greatest moment in boxing history imo </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could see that, barely but on the other hand what constitutes good hobbies? Wouldnt this be an easy question to lie about, with no way to check on? Would you disqualify someone for not having hobbies but is qualified for the job? Imo relatibilty is overrated in an interview. Its arkward and nervewrecking to begin with and someone who is relatable during this process has no direct correlation to their relatabilty to co workers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many. Cooking, music, dancing, fighting the british, fighting both World wars etc. and major contributions to all named. What you seem to fail to realize is not every southerner supported or participated in slavery. And you rounding us all together is offensive, bias and a damn shame to those southerners who did.




Do you define your "inheritance" or "tradition" by profiting off the slaughter of Native Americans? Are you so nieve to believe northerners all supported the war or made no profit off of slavery? Do you attack christians for their dark days?

<TEXT> It seems he doesnt even know what southern heritage is, or at the very least clearly define it.





He seems like the type of person to bitch about the confederate flag but ignore the nazi symbols or christian symbol in the country and ignore all the horror and slavery associated with them. Also type of person to get uppity only when a racial crime is covered by the media and ignore the countless others that happen every day. May be wrong but this post leads me to believe not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are defining southern heritage as the rebel flag, ill agree with most of what you said. But i also respect those to have a different opinion and their right to wave a flag, any flag. Should they change the flag, no, its historical. Should it be hung from government buildings, that is a tricky question, and imo no. But do i care if my neighbor has one on his car, house, shirts, no and frankly neither should you. Not every northerner was against slavery either. For that matter there are just as much racist northerners as they are in the south, now and back then.




If your defining heritage as tradition, or inheritance, again not every southerner supported or participated in slavery. Do you define your family traditions by every wrong they have ever done? Is it possible in your mind to uphold your family traditions even if you disagree with their actions? Do you define your northern heritage as having a major hand in the wrongful slaughter of the Native americans?





Also on another note. Slavery was only combated partially on the notion of human rights, and the slaves lively hood. And partially because the south and its exports, cotton,etc, could charge whatever they wanted. The north had no leverage, they couldnt boycott forever. The south wasnt effected by such because they didnt pay their workers. So eventually the north would have to agree to much higher price than deserved. The civil war was fought partially for human rights and partially for economic of goods, including a few other reasons.




Your post implies that all southern heritage is from slave owners and the northern heritage has no such implications, this is ludicrous. I would assume most reasonable people in the country dont feel that way. Every person who lived in the north were not against slavery nor do they have clean hands when it comes to racism and equal rights, same can be said of the south.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Few more questions for you, btw thaks for the repiies.




1.How does the protein on the egg thing age 5 or 6 years if the box can only go back as far as it has been initialy set? 




2.Is it possible aaron tells Grady(father) about the machine after the original party incident where something presumbaly happens to his daughter?  take the emergency coversation abe and aaron have into play




3.Is there a logical explaination for why Granger is sitting outside aarons house and why he ran away after following them? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1.Ok so every box usage creates a parallel timeline. So we are being talked to from aaron 2 from the 3rd timeline? Because timeline 2 doesnt have a 3rd aaron, and once the timelines pass the loop the original cease to exist so thats why there is 2 left at the end? With this logic there would have to have been 3 abes but he doesnt use the machine with aaron the 3rd time he goes alone to switch with aaron2, so why are we left with the same number of abes and aarons when they didnt use the machine the same amout of times?




2.Ill buy that




3.REDDIT




4.Ill buy that, and i originally assumed that. But what do they do with the body(i realize this is speculation), or they keep the body till it passes the loop and it ceases to exist? Wouldnt keeping the body at aarons have aaron1 directly crossing paths with 2 n 3(which aaron does cross paths but abe doesnt know that and trys to prevent such an act so why would abe willing do this?)? 




5.So they are voluntarily up in the attic? Was this explained why they went in the attic instead of say a hotel? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.So you are saying the only aaron left at the end is the one building the bigger machine? What about the 2 abes, the one watching for aaron and the original?



2.How would aaron 2, narrator, know about the last timeline, or the countless times he went back to change the partys outcome?




3.Ill buy that, just seemed like there was more to it.




4.It seemed like how Granger found out and used the machine was a complete mystery to aaron and abe, did they figure it out? They never actually use the failsafes together and i thought abe at that point was unaware that aaron knew about the fail safes.





5.Ill buy that, but why can the girl hear rat like sounds in the attic?

<TEXT> Never seen EH, but i have seen this graph. It contradicts some other explainations ive seen but its damn detailed.



It doesnt answer my questions unfortunately. What happens after the timeline does abe 12345 cease to exist like wiki says or some other possibility? And if they do how is the end possible?


It doesnt touch on my 2nd and 3rd questions. For that matter not even the 4th or 5th but i realize the last two questions are most likely unanswerable to 100% certainity.

According to wiki, once the original version passes the loop he ceases to exist and the traveller continues. How does the end make sense in this logic?




Assuming wiki is wrong, Aaron travels back to change the party 20 times or more, shouldnt there be 20 or more versions?




Abe tells aaron in the airport dont force me to use the power i have, what is he referring to?




What do they do with comatose Grady? 




How do they keep the versions of themselves locked in the attic, why can the wife or SO hear rat like noises?





Will say Great movie, watched it earlier today 1st time and have been spending time trying to piece it together. Through reddit and google. Any help with these questions would be appreciated

<TEXT> Completely wrong. The album was popular because the music was great had nothing to do with Bon scotts death. If the album sucked it wouldnt be a best seller of all time, you kind of made my points for me.




The music was written before scott died. They record the music then do vocals as every album acdc has ever done. Bon died shortly after the music was recorded.



Bon scott and brian johnson have completely different sounding voices.




Ac/dc was on the rise in the late 70s, highway to hell was their most sucessful album up to that point. Back in black was a product of their rising fan base and would have been a sucess regardless of scotts death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea here you can buy booze anytime and walk freely around with any beverage. Its not like that every where though, most states only sell booze up to a certain time and you cannot walk in public with an open alchol beverage. You have to stay in the bar or facility where drink was purchased.




Yea pretty much anywhere in the states you can have alchol in the car but its illegal to open any such drink in the car regardless of your blood toxicity level. Thats why a daquri shop is insane because the drink is open already. Would seem to a reasonable person these places are breaking the law the moment they had you the drink.




No if you get caught elsewhere in the states walking around with opened alchol its a crime but not driving crime. Only if you have open beverage in car, regardless of blood level. They can also take you to jail for refusing a breathlizer.




I dont know how Dui work in germany and ofcourse its frowned on everywhere but Louisiana is very tough on Dui. Its like a $500 fine, mandatory jail time, $500 in classes, possible suspended license. You are also required to get sr22 insurance for 2 years which basically triples your normal insurance. Your 2nd penalties increased vastly, and your license almost surely suspended. 3rd is considered a felony. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When i say electrified guitar i mean the things that electrify them as well.Yea, guitars were around, but not widely used the way jimi or rock music used them. Jimi and rock acts alike were very brutal on their guitars unlike the common jazz musician or pop artist who barely moved. The design for this was vastly improved on, of course the quality got better with time.




Major differences in their guitars. Jimi could not find a left handed guitar so he had to flip his and chizzle the nut. Srv uses a flip guitar b/c of his dedication to jimi and this design was vastly improved on. He also had a poor tremelo system that helped keep his guitar out of tune. SRV had a much better quality guitar choice and tremelo system.




Amp designs were vastly improved on. Technology has made great improvements in blues. The tube amps design is not much different but the tube itself has vastly improved. So have the speakers they use, which makes a major difference. Also the way the music is recorded makes a world of difference as well, this also much improved by SRV time.





Jimi was not just blues SRV was. Jimis direction was vastly new and different and technology and an early death hindered this. Srv was jimis biggest fan. So yes you short both of their talents by putting one on bass but lets be honest if a choice was made Srv would be happliy pluck the bass so jimi could play.

<TEXT> At the time the church was much less challenged and those that did so were socially crushed. His bad image has seemingly lasted, and i agree its a bit silly. He wrote some great books, even when possesed, very talented writer. Great works on practical magic that delves into black magic and summons, his life work really.




I cant remember specifics but almost certainly cocaine and lsd trippy kind of substances.




Also, i think comments have been deleted he didnt form the church of satan. Its founding almost certainly used some of his works but he didnt consider himself a satanist at all. And the church was founded after his death. From what i understand in his pursuit of magic, he discovered it was plausible to summon Satan. And if the pain stakingly detail oriented summon was performed properly, Satan would come forth and annoit the with god-like powers. So his pursuit of this consumed him, he wanted the powers as opposed to being a rebel of the Church. </TEXT>

SRV would have handed hendrix the guitar, of much better quality than he was used too, with a floyd rose,keep it in tune, gladly picked up a bass and sat there to get schooled first hand, and loved every second of it.



EDIT, SRV was a bit faster but imo he played the same licks constantly so of course he mastered them. Hendrix was way ahead in chords and phrasing, also just another level creativity. With that said i love SRV, simply great but in this case SRV wouldnt bite the hand who feed him, imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crowely was a satanist of sorts, a rebel if you will and participated in black magic. He endlessly tried to summon the devil. One of his books was claimed by crowely to have been wriiten by a demon he summoned that possesed him, The book of law. He was also assumed to have done sacrifices, crazy orgies, and did massive amounts of drugs requiring his cult to do the same.



He is wrapped up in things people tend to look down on, so they shun him. I find his writing and stories fasinating.



Little known fact, Jimmy page was an avid fan. Led zeppelin even recorded their most famous album in crowelys former mansion. It has been rumored the many tragedies that struck the band after their sessions were from being cursed by Crowelys lingering previously summoned evils there. Including a few serious accidents and two deaths </TEXT>

I'm sure there are other reasons, I can only speak to my experience in Louisiana and in my case it was a requirement after a DUI.

<TEXT> To add, another aspect of slavery rarely touched on was the price of goods. The south and it's products such as cotton could basically charge whatever they deemed. The north could not effectively combat these prices by boycott because the south wasn't paying their workers so a boycott would not effect them much. The north could only hold out for so long, they needed the products offered from the south.




So slavery was a human rights issue in one hand but also very much an economic of goods issue that had nothing to do with the terror of slaves or improving their livelihood  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the sentences you pointed out does need some restructuring but most of what you brought up is just rephrasing the sentence to your liking. It's mostly your opinion on how you would write it as opposed to being grammatically correct. There are issues grammatically but not to the extent you are portraying. I do need to improve the effectiveness of punctuation. 



I disagree it doesn't have a good flow, which is mainly determined by opinion anyway. We can both read Hemingway and agree its good, well structured, grammatically sound but disagree on flow.

<TEXT> A misconception is actors can only do what they have done in the past. You can tell a great actor by diversity in his roles, so i do like Rockwell for this role as ive said but dont limit yourself thinking well this actor has never done this type of role so it means he cant.




I think Affleck seized the opportunity to work with one of the greatest directors in recent history. The first time i saw this movie it blew me away. But Fichers movies are so great b/c of their rewatch ability imo. I cant tell you how many times ive watched fight club, girl with dragon tattoo, etc




But affleck just doesnt hold up in multiple viewings after the script and its twist are revealed imo. With that said i think his directing will only improve a great deal from this point on. Makes me wish he was still doing Kings The Stand. </TEXT>

The second sentence is saying your dark(madness) side is linked to your light(sane) side no matter if you try to deny or confirm. A denial would be frail and weak and to confirm is bold and strong.




Good call on a few sentences there. Although i do like the idea "i have taken the trip some say i have never returned" so that madness plays a part in sentence formation and structure. Although this was not my intention it is a fruitful thought   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found it quite interesting. An atheist trying to find supernatural meaning ending in tragedy. Even with its unfavorable outcome and unreasonable evidence he never released that supernatural feeling. Like a non believer who knows you cannot prove something doesnt exist, but knows there is a possibility, he chose to indulge in the small chance of the supernatural that he cant bring himself to apply to the grand scheme of things, but instead applys it to his intimate side and emerse his love in the supernatural. Maybe not the authors intention but it provoked my reaction none the less. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [OT] Contending with Madness, a trip to the Dark Side of your Mind. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-08 02:05:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To defend your madness is to defend your sanity. They are infinitely linked, eternally combined, a part of all of us no matter the frailty of the denial or the strength of the conformation. We are all trapped in our heads, there is no escape, there is nothing more. Our minds are a small galaxy and each of us add to the multiverse of the human existence. With your bloodline being your universe. We are all on the deepest levels at an extreme distance from each other but on a cosmic scale ever so close. We can if we really try and reach out, attempt to connect, like a highly advanced telescope spying on the surrounding cosmos, and dig into the endless wonders of the neighboring universe. And if you know how and what to look for the data can be immense and overwhelming. But never the less an illusion to a true connection.






We are all moving away from each other at a staggering pace, starting from the time we began. We hide parts of ourselves that can never be found, and with enough time not even by the hider themselves. Our secrets overlap secrets that overlap secrets that's overlapping a distant face of the Truth. The part of ourselves that are hidden are locked in a safe that's filled with other smaller safes. It is reopened from time to time and a smaller safe with a different combination is neatly tucked in next to all the rest. The individual combinations are lost over time and consequently only so many safes can ever be opened.






Even when you think you have successfully connected with a distant galaxy it is only an illusion to the true contents. You only receive ripples from an ever filling lock box. The real makeup of any soul is only fragments of the Truth. You can trace back their steps, study their orbits, even predict future reactions, and gather all the evidence available. But alas in the end you are only left with theories and no observable science to test, no universal key to their lock box. The mysteries that are trapped there are most not even obtainable to the author(hider) themselves, lost to the dark side. 






Living inside this false illusion is where the light shines brightest, you can only expose your forgotten past, hidden truths, and the origin of your true nature by exploring the Dark Side of your Mind, the side of your mind that's orbit never touches the light. A trip there and you will never return the same, if you return at all. The Madness, the Darkness, it will forever be intertwined in your being, grabbing ahold, tightening its grip and never letting go.







But there in that darkness will be the long lost combinations of your past, and the keys to your future. The trip is worth the burden, outweighs the risk of never leaving the comfort, the light. To make this trip is to make the most of your galaxy and better understand the multiverse that surrounds us all. My trip has been satisfying and enlightening, although some say I have never returned. But I find solace in something the great Alexander Dumas wrote, " There is neither happiness nor misery in the world, there is only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness." 




       

So Travel to the Dark Side of your Mind and contend with your Madness.  </TEXT>

Stop wasting your time and energy with me. Live your life with no more thought of the divine. Plunge into the depths of reality treading new paths where ever you go. Spark inspiration in others and freely receive these charges. Fear none but respect all. Enjoy this gift as this will be your only one. Make sure in your final moments , as the movie of your past and present plays out you are not filled with Regret but overcome with a feeling of having Reinvented the Gods. Only then will we meet, and i know you've got an entertaining film, so i got my popcorn ready, so 2 say.



GOD

Our minds are a small galaxy and each of us add to the multiverse of the human existence. Your bloodline is your universe. We are all distant but on some cosmic scale ever so close.

Most historical claims in the bible come under much scrutinty even by christians




Do you think if you were brought up in a different enviroment you would have found a different religion?

<TEXT> I disagree. One or two of those things maybe not a big contributor but all of them combined becomes a factor.



Lets say its only 2% difference in total cost between digital and tangible. That might not sound like alot but its probaly close to 100s of thousands dollar difference. Especially when your profit margin is higher with digital copies.




Also another reason games are not digitized is the market is higher for physical games. Gamers like the option to be able to trade in games when done and purchase old ones that digital copies cant offer. This is in some way justifies a higher cost to sell more games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nba has a salary cap which means teams contract cost per year has to be under a certain amount. For ex, say the salary cap is 60million in 2016, that means Golden states player contracts total has to be under 60 million in 2016.  The cap changes based on the previous years leagues earning. The reasoning behind the cap is to control league cost and to keep teams competitive. 




Nba has a "soft" salary cap. Which means there are circumstances in which a team is allowed over the cap. When a team unjustly goes over this cap the penalty is usually minor in the form of a "salary tax". This is different than in the Nfl.



Free agents. A unrestricted Fa is a player whose contract has run out and other teams can make an offer. A rescrited Fa is a player whose contract has run out but in order to sign him conditions apply. Like a team will place a draft pick on a restricted Fa if a team wants him enough and signs that Fa they forfeit a pick to players former team. This condition only last for part of the offseason and allows teams who can meet these conditions to have first dibbs.



Veterans minium is the lowest a team is allowed to pay a vet. The min is lower for those players for are not vets. This bar is usually set during collective bargaining agreements between the owners and players union.



The max is the highest a team can pay any one player. This can vary. Because of a soft salary cap, a team is allowed to go over the cap to keep a player on their roster. Say stephen curry is a Fa. Golden state will be allowed to offer him a higher max deal than clevland, because GS can exceed the cap to try and keep him. This is really to allow small market teams to retain stars by being able to offer them more money, as well as othe reasons.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a former christian, i still struggle with the idea of God and am curious about certain things ive had troubling answering and how those who still believe personally can/do. My point is not to offend but to understand So i might pry a little into responses with why's and how's. I had a similar post recently that had some enlighting results. 



I will also add i dont think it immoral or wrong to question your faith choice, it is healthy and will only strengthen and enlighten personal truths, whatever that truth turns out to be for you.




Ive always wondered how you can be certain your religion is the right one, Gods intended religion. How much certainity comes from your upbringing and/or demographic and would it be different if some factors were even slightly changed. So i pose a few questions to seek some insight from those who are christians who have undoubtly had the same questions enter their mind and how they responded. And if you havent asked yourself these questions why not?




How can you be sure, out of the countless religions including the different forms of christianity, you have choosen right? And do you think, to those who it applies to, your upbringing and/or demographic has had influence on this choice?




Have you given any effort into looking at other religions and their teaching to confirm your choice? Why or why not?



Have you had moments where you question your choice? If so why or what settled these doubts?




And do you find everything in your religion agreeable, including certain events/passages in the bible? Why or why not?   </TEXT>

I have never ducked your points but when you started making comments like the minority is always wrong and such it became apparent a reasonable debate would not be possible. So to continue on in a wrong thread was pointless.




Again, as ive told you 3-4 times now, if you want to debate the prestige make a thread, or lets continue in an existing one.

1 continue to let the n word have no equal. Which im trying to offer an alternative




2 give the n word an equal. This would just seem immplausiable and encourage the behavior that should stop




3. Treat the n word like every other slur and curse. This is very simplified but the heart of my argument here in option 3 </TEXT>

Your boss can threaten your job, it has no relation to violence.




A racist can say the n word with out the threat of violence with just the intention of trying to humilate you. If you percieve that as violent threat that is a problem.



Now a racist can say hey n ill kill you. Thats obviously a threat of violence that i could agree a physical reaction could be well with in reason. But for that matter in this instance you could replace n with any word and it would still be the same threat.

Racist will always use the word. Its up to the recipent to decide what it means to them and how they respond but this in noway justifies its usage. This lessens the damage done and by no way downplays the words racism or condons people to use it more.



Yes in a way im putting responsibilty on the victim to change what damage is caused because by reacting a certain way you will establish it as a racist verbal nuke that will always be used as opposed to treating it as any other curse. 



But again you keep going back to the possibilty of this, which Is Not the topic. Where the power comes from is. With that said the word is only viewed as racist in certain context, so that just proves the word can be treated as non offensive by the recipent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great points and one im kind of hinting to specifically. Let me elaborate by compressing the argument i make to 2 races white and black, although the argument is not mutually exclusive to these 2.




A black has no verbal nuke compared to a white having the verbal nuke of the n word. So the best situation is no one has verbal nukes. But by the first statement made in this paragraph the second best option of everyone having verbal nukes is impossible. So the best situation becomes the only one. The only way to suceed at this is to disarm those who have a verbal nuke. This is basically my point im trying to make. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again where in the definition of worship does it sAy you have to believe in the thing you are expressing revere or adoration for. You are adding to the definition as you please to fit your argument here. It might not make sense to you that worship has to be followed with belief or it doesn't count but that's not how the word is defined, like your armament position on a verb that I disagree with but have conceded because my point is not clearly defined as so the same thing is happening here but you refuse to concede by adding to the definition. 




Again comparing Greece to today is crazy. The war famine mistreatment of women were done to a bigger proportion than it is today by a impossible margin, the actions of such were more widely accepted. 



I'm saying that as human intelligence has grown and societies evolve morality follows suit. I'm saying the ways to survive(morality defined) were not as clear as they are today, the choices are more black and white to what is right and wrong today then it was back then. Not saying there are black and white today but are more clearly defined. 


I could be wrong, but it seems evident IMO you are applying your pre notion of what you think morality is and applying it to my statements as opposed to how I'm defining it(not the evolution of morality but how I define it). It might clear up your points to me if you look at my definition of morality I gave you days ago and apply that to my argument, and then come back with your counter. Might help. 




Evolution absolutely goes forward though a process of natural selection. The species that are less fit for their enviroment don't survive, and evolution moves forward with the rest. Same thing in applying to primitive firms of morality. Sure some forms of morality had some good elements, some bad, some inbetween but though natural selection the less suitable ones die out while the more suitable ones survive and evolve with their surroundings, humans and society.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worship by your definition, revere and express adoration for something, could be done by a nonbeliever it doesn't say anything about being genuine or a believer. Again if something has to exist for worship as you keep trying to say, you have to prove God exists to prove your worship is a moral act, or you are simply not answering the question. 



You are simply not seeing my point, you are hanging on your pre notions of morality. Ancient Greece might have had some forms of morals but women were not treated right, slavery,  war, famine, etc to epic proportions. To say Greece was a more intelligent, sophisticated society, with cleArer morals to today, just because of your view of homosexuals is ludacris. You are cherry picking here, and cherry picking there. 



Also again, if you are saying Ancient Greece is more morally sound I would ask you to elaborate, it's quite obvious to me. Again can you show a source of evolution going backwards?  </TEXT>

My point is by treating the word this way you strengthen the ways a racist can hurt you verballyy. In fact you make it easy. They can hurt you deeply by one word anyone with half a vocabulary can say, as opposed to having them do the same verbal damage by other more intellectually complex ways.

<TEXT> Of course a non believer can. I can walk into any church and take part in the mass, and worship with them. I can walk out still a non believer and have worshipped with believers. That can be seen by fellow believers and god as a moral act, might not be genuine but now your defining worship however you want. When did genuine mutually exist with moral?

So let's say god doesn't exist, then your worshipping a non existent god, that worship would cease to be a moral act in your way of thinking. So now you would have to prove god exist for your worship to be one a moral act.



No morals have not regressed. A universal morality is much better than it was 200 yeArs ago. The places where you refer to that make women inferior are religious based, and therefore are hanging there morals on books that were written in  a time of a primitive form of morals. It can also be assumed following immoral ways to survive. Morality evolving does not mean every one chooses to be moral. Morality can be light years evolved and there will still be people who choose immoral and who influence others. 




Morality evolving, again, defines things more clearly. 300 years ago the inferior women you refer to would still be seen as morally ok. But as we evolve it's more universally held that what's going on there is wrong. Even though slavery has happened somewhat recently not everyone agreed with this. The fact it's not happening in the USA now is a sign of progress coupled with the fact that our country is run on evolved morals.



You could bring up sadaams recent regime, but nothing in his regime reflects evolved morals. I can't make this any clear just because morals evolve does not mean that everyone chooses the right path. Having a universal moral does not rid of evil or bad morals. It only makes clear what paths you take to survive are good and bad. 



So your argument that morals haven't evolved because people are still acting immoral that's simply ludacris. Can you give an example of where evolution goes backward?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To your point about worship counting, is this, let's say god exist and even though as a non believer you are not sure about the existence of god but worship anyway this would of course be seen as a moral act by god, what would you define this as immoral? wBut again this is a slippery slope and we could both hang on technicalities and interpretations but once you start hanging on mental actions that could not be proven, it can't be proven for me to say the opposite and cancel your argument out. But I don't see a point in that direction, but again if you want to proceed with this in a proven, not directly canceling out, action I'm open to that direction.



You are confusing maturing with evolving. A person can lose their maturity at any given moment, see Donald's trump recent statements. I'm talking about evolving. A collective human evolution has taken place that doesn't go backwards, we are not turning back into apes, same thing with morality. It doesn't go backward it has evolved with time in the same way. As we grow and explore the options I have described and their consequences the good and bad are clearly defined.

<TEXT> I guess we will have to just disagree , you are walking a fine line in defining action. For that matter an even finer line when you consider the original question. The "action" you are referring to cannot be observed and happens internally, for that matter I could play the game of a non believer could worship, he doesn't have to believe to worship, and you can't prove he is not worshiping because it's not observable it's all internal. You could say a believer can think of god that's moral, that's an action, but without it being observable you are just playing games with the question, which should have multiple answers that aren't trying to play a fast one. Again I could easily say well a non believer thought of god. But I won't play that game, I'll leave it there.

<TEXT> We had a long conversation it's just a little unsatisfactory for it to end this way for me when we had a reasonable back and forth and now you won't acknowledge a verb is not always an action, or for that matter the points we left on evolution of morals not degressing. But if that's where you want to end, not being able to prove your points on verbs, or elaborate further, that's fine, but the progress we had at first tempted me to continue what at one time was a reasonable exchange. 




Ok, well you are just wrong on worship not being a state of being. Worship happens in your head, it's not an action. But if your right you should be able to use worship as an action. That's the question can you use worship as an action(as opposed to the other meaning of Verb)in a sentence for me?

<TEXT> I'm not excited(I find your assumption of tone quite comical) simply trying to understand your confusion, which after 200 responses no one else as had.I'll try one more time, I'm asking Christians about the story of Adam and eve(as this post shows many consider the original sin, but again you are hanging on the title not the description) and how this relates to your belief. If you have no relation of the two whatever you define as original sin if it has nothing to do with Adam and Eve then it's not really what I'm asking.



Furthermore I'm asking about your beliefs, mine are irrelevant but you keep wanting me to define. I'm asking simply what you believe about this story and how it fits into your beliefs, not what I believe about the story and how it fits into your belief. </TEXT>

<TITLE> CMV: The invasion of Iraq was the right thing to do. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-27 00:54:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I want to start by I believe we made horrible mistakes once we entered Iraq. The biggest being the dissolution of the Iraq army and the laws that were passed to essentially keep them out, there were many many more but this is the biggest.



The invasion of Iraq was a good thing in these ways. Sadaam was a true representation of evil. All of his evils need not be explained one by one, but I think it's universally held he was evil and poison to the country he was ruling.



 As far as WMD, bush had conflicting reports as to whether they were there or not. Even if the reports leaned in the favor he did not presently own, there was evidence he had been trying to obtain WMD. Should we wait till he had obtained such to invade where he would surely use his obtained WMD in war? He also has the history of using WMD in war. He also stated in his trial, he did give the illusion to having WMD because he was worried if he didn't and it was known Iran would invade. He also I believe in 1998, not sure this exact year, refused to cooperate with having people come into the country to examine if he had WMD or not something he agreed to do in the early 90's.



He was also giving diplomatic immunity to terrorist and war criminals. He might not have had direct ties to bin laden but was aiding other terrorist and war criminals in other ways. The war on terror was not just about bin laden but to all terrorist organizations. 




To summarize, He wAs a terrible person to be in power, giving the illusion he had WMD by his own admission and history of being willing to use such, and aiding terrorist and war criminals. This was a good thing to strip him of his power. With that said we made many mistakes after the invasion. As far as setting up the governing body, dissolving the iraq army,etc. but as far as the decision to invade it was the right thing to do, and it lessened the places terror could operate in that part of the world. Also showing USA would not tolerate these many threats, not one or two, as other leaders have done,  but the many violations sadaam has committed will not be tolerated. Change my views

<TITLE> CMV:The things science cannot explain is not a reasonable place to put God. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-26 09:07:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a former catholic and no longer believe in God. The argument I hear for proof of god is mainly in the things science can't explain. Something couldn't have come from nothing, dark matter, intelligent design, etc. This is nonsensical.



You are essentially issuing in the same behavior ancient civilizations did. They could not understand at the time the weather, the sun, the cosmos, etc so it had to be God. All of the scriptures are written by people who had no such knowledge of the things They claimed to be God, and their lack of knowledge bleeds through as science unlocks more and more.




Now this is not to say God exists or does not exist. This is not my debate but my debate is where people are putting God. I think it quite possible to believe in God and also believe that science will shed light on the places it is the dark. Hence this post. To me is not reasonable in a world where people don't believe in God,or who believe in a different God, that putting on a label on the unexplainable is God. It is logical to put your faith, so to speak, in that science will explain these things in time, and that your belief in God belongs else where.



Now I also want to clarify to do the the things my debate touches on is not wrong, or immoral, it is simply unreasonable, not logical. I know there are many things that can give credence to your personal experiences and the deep thing inside most people there is more to this world than us. And that the proof of God is not a thing that can be measured in scientific terms. But I disagree that the universe, or multiverse, and all it's contents cannot be explained by science, and it's not logical to put god here. Change my views

<TITLE> CMV: The Shining(movie) does a poor representation of the hotels true power, as opposed to the books intent. Spoiler </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-25 01:02:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First I will say I love both and like alternate versions of the same story. On the other hand I donnot understand the argument that the hotel is represented just as evil as it is in the book(not to be confused with the hotel is not evil in the movie).



Kubrick makes intended changes to the books plot seemingly to down play the true evil of the hotel. Take for instance the different endings. In the book the hotel is destroyed, and the movie it's left standing. If the hotel is as evil in the book as it is in the movie, the hotel should have been destroyed.


Take the maze scene. Kubrick places this maze scene in where Danny is chased by the insane gone over the edge jack. Where as the book jack is possessed by the hotel and chases Danny through the halls, his voice and demeanor is extremely unfamiliar to Danny. Jack seemingly goes over the edge as opposed to being possessed by a the hotel. 



Last example is the hedges. The hotel can control the hedges and bring them to life. As Danny's shine gets stronger and fuels the hotels power the hedges go from just moving their positions, to being able to attack the occupants. This is left out seemingly to downplay the hotels capabilities. That's as good place to start as any so Change my views.

<TITLE> CMV: The Prestige, the machine does not work. Spoiler alert. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I will start by I have struggled with this concept since it has been brought to my attention. I know this movie extremely well, better than I should, and have previously debated just about every scene. Not to say the this conclusion is right but to say I do know the film and the characters well. 



My basic theory stems from, The movie constantly allures to what and how magic is done, which has nothing to do with 'real magic' but with deceit. That's what the machine is deceit.  Will give  a summary of my theory now, leaving out the beginning and end, and details as my post will be too long for any interest. I will elaborate on the beginning and end , and details once the discussion begins.



So Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no "magic". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs "real magic" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work. 



Angier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning.



I will add a few of the questions about the machine working theory that I have, which can be answered by my theory. These questions could be preluded with "if the machine works"



What is the tank Caine and Angier are pushing during the ending scene? If if the last clone is in the morgue, and the tank had been broken to extract the clone what tank are they pushing?



Why store the clones? What not rid of them every night?


What is the air bubble at the end in the only visible tank.



How did Angier gain full control of both his legs while drowning? The movie goes through some length to show how damaged it is, why do this if it's not meant to be.a clue



If Borden sends angiers to tesla, it's his plan, why wait till he has  captured Fallon to give him Teslas name, why not give it to him when he gives Angier the diary?



I have more of my theory to share, and more question to ask those who disagree it this is already too long. Looking for reasonable, logical, light hearted debate, so bring it on reddit change my views

<TITLE> Who is the better actor to you and why? Tom cruise or Leonardo Dicaprio?? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why these 2, well I had this debate with a friend recently, i wanted to know what Reddit thinks.




My case is for Leo. I feel Tom cruise is very similar in alot of his roles. Leo to me has taken more risk, is more convincing at different types of roles, and simply picks better movies. And the fact Scorsese works with Leo, amoung many other actors again and again and has worked with Cruise once is odd.




Again tell me who you like and Why?

<TITLE> Have you heard of bands making records in this way??? What do you think about it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-21 04:06:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The lead singer and guitar player for the Wild hearts, Ginger, decided to release a solo album. Instead of dealing with the record company, he decided to set up a fundraiser deal. Where people interested in buying his record would send him money. I think the first 10,000 was like 50$ and the rest was 25$. 




The first 10,000 recieved 20 songs then a vote was taken as to which 10 made it on to the record. The top ten made it. Once the songs were finalized the first 10,000 got both the official record and the record of the other 10, i believe in both cd and record format. The ensuing investors received the official record.




I just love this idea. Getting your chance to participate in the making of the record and taking all outside influence away, leaving the artist with complete freedom. Other bands have used this strategy, including Radiohead(not 100% this band).




 REDDIT what are your thoughts? Do you love or hate it? Would you participate? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ozzy and his unforgiveable Greed. Did you know??... </TITLE>

<TEXT> Ozzy and sharon have been fighting the surviving members of the randy rhodes era, over their rightful royalties. Bob daisley and lee kerslake have been trying to receive their fair share but are getting denied. They had ample share in writing the music and recording "Blizzard of Oz" and "Diary of a Madman", although they did not tour on these records.



Ozzy went so far as to remove their tracks and rerecord them when they were remastered. To stay consistent upon the release of the 2 albums box sets, Daisley offered up hours and hours of early takes, demos, and studio outtakes, Ozzy refused because Daisley wanted royalties instead of it being bought outright.




As a lifelong fan of Ozzy, i cannot forgive him for this greed, and i have just recently stumbled upon this. To think you cant even buy the orignal music from the randy rhode era is infuriating. Tell me what you think Reddit.

<TEXT> I have watched the film many times, close to twenty. It makes more sense that it doesnt work, really the only thing that makes sense imo. There are clues everywhere in the movie once you grasp the timeline and Angier and Bordens never ending deception (this includes angier's last attempt to fool borden at the very end). 




I wont go into specifics here, but will debunk the theories presented in the discussion. Whether you agree or disagree completely let me know what you think.
