<TEXT> It's a good gateway manga for guys who are otherwise wary of the typical shoujo fare (ie high school romance drama/comedy). I think it's almost a little unfair to label Basara as shoujo (just because of the label it's published under), it's really first and foremost a fantasy genre manga imo. 

Also, for those who read and like Basara, Anatolia Story (aka Red River) is similar though it has a tad bit more romance if memory serve (it's been at least 10 years since I read that haha). 

Ah the nostalgia...   </TEXT>

I understand Hannibal is doing it to try and have the last laugh with Will, especially after Will "breaks up" with him. But it just seems so out of character for him. Unless... Will actually manipulated Hannibal into turning himself in by pretending to not care about him and using his need for Will's attention against him. THAT I could get behind 100%.  </TEXT>

While I'm happy with the decision because that means we'll get to see Red Dragon on screen (I was fairly sure that season 3 was going to be Hannibal's last even before it aired).

<TEXT> I didn't think he was fake until the episode where he pushed Elliot off the railing and landed him in the hospital and there was literally no repercussions or confrontations and everyone thought Elliot had tried to kill himself or something. Which made me wonder with all of the unreliable narrator stuff if Mr. Robot was all in Elliot's head space. And then after the thought crossed into my mind, I literally could not unsee from the show.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a pretty good summary of what's not working well season. The dialogue is jarring to the point that it sticks out, the editing awkward as hell during some scenes (which makes me wonder if Nic is having too much say in the editing room), and a plot that's still making me scratch my head as to what the point of it all is. There's a lot of on screen talent, but they only have as much as they're given to work with. I think all of the leads have been fantastic.  </TEXT>

Also, the three main characters had so much plot armor that I really didn't feel worry that they were going to get killed at all.

<TEXT> I thought he was too far gone to gain redemption, but was looking forward to watch him at least try. 

EDIT: Apparently according to a screen cap from one of the season trailers, he's still alive. Also, in the next episode promo, the detective only refers to Ray as "one of his detective getting shot"... so I'm guessing he's still alive. Way too much unresolved story arc and wasted character development there otherwise. </TEXT>

Things that were especially outstanding in tonight's episode: 

* The lighting - everything from the soft light of the windows and candles to the contrast of light and shadow on people's faces to the low, dim lighting of the last scene was outstanding.  
* The use of symmetry - full throttle in this episode. 
* Framing Will in tight, confined shots, lines, and spaces to convey a sense that he is trapped by Hannibal's designs.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it was for that last line about Hannibal being lonely and wishing it was Will Graham dining with him. It further helps the viewer understand how much Hannibal wanted Will's friendship and how much it cut him when he was betrayed. It also leads up to the Hannibal broken heart scene at the very end of the episode.  </TEXT>

* Fantastic acting   casting, particularly for Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal and Hugh Dancy as Will 
* Beautiful cinematography
* Amazing art direction (and creativity around the murder tableaus)
* Best sound and music I've heard on a TV show ever - eerie and atmospheric
* Dark, gothic sets and costumes (especially the color palettes) 
* Bryan Fuller
* Well written and well paced

Also because: 

* The exploration of the friendship between Hannibal and Will 
* The exploration of the pathological psyche of Will Graham and the killers he pursues 
* It's not afraid to push the boundaries of art, graphic violence, and dark stories on network television  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This absolutely stunning. I know you have an entire thread full of people telling you already, but I really enjoy art of all mediums and this is incredibly beautiful and unique and I can only imagine the career you'll have ahead of you. I wish I were in a point in my career/life where I can afford to drop thousands on this and keep it for myself, but sadly I'm not. 

Also, as someone who works in business/finance, I agree with the other posters when I say you should absolutely take no less than $5K for this. You should probably ask for more and I wouldn't be surprised if you could sell this for upwards of $10K to the right buyer. Here's a helpful hint, in all negotiations, always let the other person give you a starting price. You may be surprised at what they start with.

<TEXT> You were so close! It was Miller's Crossing. :) 

My full list for reference: 
			
1. Miller's Crossing 
2. No Country for Old Men 	
3. Barton Fink 	
4. Fargo 	
5. A Serious Man 				
6. True Grit 	
7. Burn After Reading 	
8. The Big Lebowski									
9. O Brother, Where Art Thou?		

I'm clearly a bigger fan of their darker more dramatic works with the exception being Fargo. I love Miller's crossing not for what the Coen brothers are typically known for, but simply because I love Tom Reagan's character and I'm a sucker for mob movies. Objectively, I think that No Country is probably their best movie (followed closely by Fargo). I think a lot of people like the Big Lebowski or O Brother because they are the most accessible of their works (minimal amounts of death/murder and generally light hearted in tone). 

Agree with you that I definitely want to watch Blood Simple (and eventually Inside Llewlyn Davis) at some point as well, though right now I'm just waiting for their new movie, Hail Caesar to come out.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry I really don't remember. I added the song only about a week before it got deleted. It want to say it featured a more mainstream DJ or mainstream artist in the song, but it didn't really sound like them. 

When the song opens there's about 45secs-1min of non-80s sounding edm music, then the beat kicks in around then. Think the singer's voice sounded a little like La Roux, but I don't think if that's just because her stuff also sounds similar.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I'm looking for a track I recently added to my spotify playlist but was removed. I don't remember much else of the song other than it had an 80s beat/vibe to it and there was a female singer (who also was singing in an 80s tone). Believe it from one of the more popular artists or featured one, but I can't remember anything else other than that for the life of me.

Any help would be appreciated - thanks!

<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm thinking of taking Megabus up to DC for a weekend and I'm trying to figure out the best place to park my car for the weekend near downtown Durham where the Amtrak station is. 

I know the Durham decks are free after 7PM and on weekends, but am I just allowed to leave my car parked there all weekend? I'ved parked at the deck on Magnum (across the street from Rue Cler) on weekends before and it seems like the gate is just up all the time. 

If not, is there a deck somewhere that does allow overnight/weekend parking? (I don't mind paying I'm just trying to figure out my options). 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Key is to wait for 30% off sales or BOGO50% then stack with the coupons. Also, sign up for the Express rewards program, stack those rewards on top. Most things I buy there wind up being so ridiculously cheap they're practically F21 prices.   </TEXT>

He must know how fiercely loyal Doug is and that all he wants is for Frank to succeed and that it will only drive Doug to the current state that he's in. 

I don't buy it, it has to be a play.

EDIT link here: http://full-stream.net/5920-19-2-saison-2.html 

FYI the French scene is literally 100% the same tracking shot wise (and even shot in the same school). There are some minor differences in terms of acting and timing. The French version seems to close the shot a little better (dialogue wise), again the shot is the same.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Way too much was cut and the movie looses so much in terms of tone and theme of the original musical. The worse offense being both the act 1 ending number "Ever After" and the act 2 opening number "Once Upon a Time...Later" which is the entire premise of the story as being what happens after the typical "fairy tale" ending. Also, unnecessary change on the death of the Baker's Wife. 

I would really recommend people see another version of this, whether it be live on stage or the recorded version of the original stage production. This is one of my favorite musicals, but so many of the best songs are cut in the movie and it looses so much of it's humor and story in the process. 

Such a shame. Rob Marshall did an excellent job with Chicago... what happened here? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, that was my point exactly. 

BUT The Interview wasn't planned as a VoD release either... so maybe studios would be willing to approve a smaller budget film with a targeted VoD release. In my opinion, not every film demands a moving theater going experience (especially with the prices of tickets these days), but for smaller films or dramas will little action that necessitates a big screen viewing, this could be a great way to capture revenue from people who might otherwise just pirate it or watch it TV or rent it later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is impressive considering how unplanned the VOD release was. However, you have to temper that with the fact that this movie had HUGE publicity proceeding it, beyond what they planned on marketing so at the end of the day, this will still be a bit of an anomaly. 

Still, it will be interesting to see if Hollywood decides to use this as a case study and attempt to do more VOD related releases (whether it be stand alone or simultaneous with a big screen release).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, so I've heard a lot of things are closed during this period - just wondering how bad it is. I'm visiting with my family - do we need to make reservations or probably just be able to wander about and just find a place to eat whenever we feel like breaking? I'm asking in particular about the night of Dec 24th and Dec 25th. 

Also, are all places and shops closed on Dec 25th or are some things still open. Do you guys have any recommended areas for these days (aside from touristy sights like cathedrals or museums). 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bridesmaid dresses are different. For some weddings, the bride is very specific about the exact dress or exact color and style of dress that she wants her bridesmaids to wear. In this situation, you are forced to buy a dress that you never wear again because of how impractical it is or if it's ugly and not really your style. These are the sacrifices you make for friendship.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought Grant was finally validated in his life long belief that his brother ruined his life by claiming that Grant did that to their other brother, which then led to a series of other misfortune events that landed him in juvie and eventually with Hydra in the first place. I think he genuinely still cares for his SHIELD mates, at least Skye for any matter, and secretly hates the Hydra part of himself. But it's so engrained into his identity and who he is, that he can't detach himself from it. So that was the ultimate moment for Ward - to finally get his brother to acknowledge that he was ultimately the "cause" for all of Ward's problems/current state in his life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! Thanks for doing this! I have a few very basic questions. I'm trying to learn how to use Unity and some general programming overall. I've taken a very basic Java   C++ class before and I used to do some stuff in Ruby for RPG maker, so I have some rudimentary programming skills, but have a lot to learn. 

I'm trying to make a simple text /interactive fiction game which ideally I would want to look something like Twine (http://twinery.org/), but wrapped in some sort of GUI with point/click ability and background graphics. 

Just want some pointers on where to start/begin researching with something like this? I'd like to start with creating something like this maybe (except without the need for the room based map): 
http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/tidy-text-adventures-editor-tool-for-creating-text-based-adventure-games.164625/ 

I've never done anything like this and would just like a few pointers on where to begin. I'm not asking for an in depth tutorial or anything like that, just something like "you should read about x   y (ie parsing, etc) and how it ties into z (creating GUI, etc)". 

Thanks!   </TEXT>

When I was slightly overweight (on Asian standards mind you which meant I was like +5-10 lbs from my "ideal" weight = "holy shit you're so fat how are you ever going to get married" all the time. 

Then I went backpacking in Europe for a month and lost about 5-10 lbs = next time my parents saw me "holy shit we think you have a wasting disease you should go to the hospital to get that checked out". 

You literally cannot win.

So. Cold. But Ward is a deluded **fuck**. Im glad theyre committed to going down this evil!Ward path.  

Also, Coulson referred to Fitz and Simmons as FitzSimmons!

<TEXT> I'm really excited to see Simmons infiltrating the inner sanctum of Hydra in the coming weeks. Looking forward to her possible interactions with Agent 33 as well. I'm sure she's going to work on a way to combat the brainwashing/compliance for both Agent 33 and herself. I'm sure her cover is going to get blown eventually and they're going to try and brainwash her except at that point she'll already have developed a way to fight it.

<TEXT> That confrontation between Fitz and Ward was so powerful and absolutely heartbreaking. It's tragic to think of the consequences that Ward's betrayal has had on the team. Gone is the gentle and innocent boy scientist - replaced instead by this broken bitter man. Iain De Caestecker absolutely killed it in that scene - just the right amount of hyperventilation, fear, and barely restrained anger. 

Also, Ward is a manipulative shitbag. "It's good to see you Fitz?" Evil!Ward forever.  </TEXT>

Really all the casting is spot on. Ben McKenzie is doing a great Gordon and Robin Taylor is a great Penguin.

<TEXT> Yup completely agree. I wish they had paced the show a little better (especially with the villains) but this is just a problem that network pilots run into. You basically have to use the first episode to hook your viewers so you need to throw every single crazy plot twist/characters into it. All the character introductions were solid though a little rushed. We should have had a couple of episodes to establish Mooney   Penguin's relationship and also a couple to establish Gordon and Harvey's relationship - that way the last scene would have been more powerful. Like Penguin realizing he's on the brink of loosing everything from his attempt at betraying Mooney and Gordon realizing the true extent of his partner's corruption would have made for a way more powerful scene. 

On a side note, everyone is wonderfully cast and I look forward to this season. This was a solid pilot and solid way of introducing all the characters very quickly.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm taking a road trip with my SO and we're doing a bunch of (casual) hiking and will probably be walking around outdoors for most of the day. I know it's going to be insanely hot and I've never done much hiking before - what types of clothes should I be wearing? I've heard people say looser cotton/natural fabric items or even cotton sundresses. I was originally planning on just wearing tanks/tees with gym shorts (or something similar to that) - what do you guys think? Should I throw some loose cotton sundresses in there? (Or will I look like a fool traipsing around the parks in a dress?) 

Also, any recommendations on a reasonably fashionable hat to wear? 

Thanks in advance! 

EDIT: Thanks for all the great tips. And don't worry I will definitely plan on bringing enough water and sunscreen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Completely agree on the first point. In fact, the main motivating factor of my main character is simply the pursuit of knowledge and the general fascination/love of magic. 

And I think the idea of tying magic   history together is always fascinating (ie alternative histories), but in this particular story the knowledge that magic exists is not widely known.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not commonplace (since it's not common knowledge that there is magic). But essentially you can choose to learn fire magic if you want to, but may never really be good at it. Just like everyone can probably learn to play piano (to varying degrees, depending on the amount of time spent on learning and practicing) but not every person is going to be naturally gifted at it such as Mozart or Beethoven.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think that works in your case when the type of magic is something specific, but in my world - it's really up to the person. There are all sorts of magic, ranging from alchemy to pyromancy to evocation, etc etc. You may have more skill for particular type of magic than others, but you can theoretically try to do whatever you want. 

The issue then becomes, why would someone want to master fire magic for example? It has very few regular world uses and sure you can have one or two pyromancers who are firefighters or stage magicians but what about the general masses of pyromancers? Why would they even want to bother with something that really is just a cool trick (assuming they are the average Joe and NOT running around to defeat evil magicians or spirits).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [QUESTION/DISCUSSION] What are the motivations of your general magical population (in an urban fantasy setting)? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-24 18:51:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, 

Having a little trouble here and was hoping to brainstorm and bounce some ideas off of the community. 

So it's easy enough to create motivations for specific main or supporting characters (it can be something very specific, such as revenge for murdered friend or power through obtain some magical artifact or capturing a specific spirit/demon, etc) but what about the motivations or goals of the rest of the general magical community at large (in an urban fantasy setting)?  

Here are some examples of general motivations I've come up with:
 
* They want to keep the magical community a secret (or not). 
* They want to keep the bad guys/forces/spirits at bay. 
* They want to influence the human/magical government and policies. 
* They have family tradition/responsibilities to uphold. 
* They use it to make their regular lives/jobs easier. 
* They want to keep magic around (like a dying language or something). 

But even still, the problem is what does the average magician Joe want with his magic in life? He's not particularly powerful, he's not power hungry, he's not into politics, and he doesn't really have some sort of old family duty to keep some evil spirit in line. Why does he practice magic and what role does his magic play in his life? To take it even further, our average magician Joe has a rather impractical ability such as pyromancy - how the hell does he use this in his regular life and why would he even want/keep this ability? 

Any discussion or suggestions are greatly appreciated!

By giving Jeff Daniels a slot, they robbed more deserving candidates like Mads Mikkelsen for Hannibal, Matthew Rhys for The Americas or James Spader for The Blacklist. It's a complete shame. Also, True Detective submitting for Drama instead of Mini-series also crowds out the categories.

<TITLE> "Memory card may be damaged" error - any help ideas? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-09 23:09:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My friend lent me an older SanDisk memory to use for a bit when I initially bought a camera (and was still waiting on mine to come in the mail). After messing around for a couple of days, I go to remove the pics using my computer and got the "this memory card maybe damaged error". I noticed the gold metal part of the memory card has some marks on it (from wear, no dents or bends). 

Wondering if anyone has any ideas on how I could try recover the data. For the record, it doesn't work anymore in the camera either and I've tried using an usb to the computer as well instead of directly inserting it. I've also tried using a data recovery program (Disk Drill) with no luck either. I've pretty much given up the data as lost but there's a couple of pics on it that I'd like to save if possible - wondering if anyone else had any ideas. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've recently gotten back into playing badminton and I'm looking to buy a racket. I used to play on my high school team way back in the day, but I'm probably an advanced beginner or low intermediate skill level and an all round player. I'm not looking to play competitively and just want something that will be decent enough. I just looked for something that will suite my skill level and maybe allow a little room for improvement. 

Ideally would like to keep it within $70-80 tops, but I'm willing to look at anything in a $50-$100 range. I was looking at the Nanoray 10 and Arcsaber 002 online just because Yonex is what I'm most familiar with and I used to have a Carbonex (before it broke). When I went to the badminton place today, the guy there recommended the Black Knight Impluse 739 which he said was a great value for the price. What do you guys think? I'll also take other recommendations as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You put it perfectly. 

Some of it was impactful as it should have been. Some characters died who are not dead (which leads me to believe that since GRRM has told the producers major plot points that I need to stop watching GOT or I'll be reverse spoiling the books for myself). 

* Tyrion killing Shae   Tywin - not as impactful due to omission of his first wife backstory in the show 
* Tyrion and Jaime are still on good terms - what is this future impact? 
* Jojen dies - is this a reverse book spoiler? 
* Gregore Clegane - minor reverse book spoiler  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not defending the script or anything as it literally is a giant turd, BUT I read somewhere that in the original shooting script Anakin had a couple of reasons why he joined the dark side of the force and that one of the reasons was that he genuinely believe the Jedi were going to try and seize control. They did some reshoots after the movie was completed to change his reasoning to only wanting to save Padme and I assume that line is just left over from the original script and they just didn't really think much of it.

<TITLE> Unable to cast HD mkv files   other problems </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-05 17:40:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys I bought a chromecast recently and have been using videostream to cast local files. When it works, it's awesome, but I've been having some issues I was hoping you could help me with. I'm on a mac also so a lot of what has been mentioned hasn't helped. 

- Never finds the chromecast when I initially launch. I must type chrome://restart to have videostream find my chromecast even though other tabs/youtube/etc all cast perfectly fine without having me to do this. 
- Stutters like crazy when I try to play large mkv format files (720-1080p). Playing standard quality mp4s have never been an issue, but anything HD seems to stop and go to the point where it's unwatchable. Videos are encoded x264 - is this the issue? H264 encoded vids do not seem to be better.

Also, I have a 2 year old macbook pro (intel core i7 processor) and my internet is 4MB down/.5MB up. My video stuttering is checked to "yes". 

Anyone have any ideas as to what can help?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys - I'm currently looking for a cool roomie to share my house. 

I have one room available for rent in a spacious 4 bedroom house (2500 sq ft).  You will be sharing the house with myself (female) as well as two males. We are all young professionals working in the RTP area (two at Cisco). Rent will be $550/month and we will split utilities and cable/internet, but if you would prefer a flat monthly rate we can work that out as well. The bathroom will be shared with two people but everyone is pretty clean and neat. There are a couple of large commons spaces and there is lots of extra room for storage in garage and there is a bonus room as well. 

About me:
 
* I'm a big foodie (eating, cooking, you name it)  
* I love books, tv shows   movies!
* I'm a gamer! 
* Going out and meeting new people (and having fruity girly drinks) 
* I love traveling!

A little more about the house: 

* The house is located right off of Davis Dr. and Morrisville Carpenter Rd
* Super convenient to I-40 (20 mins to downtown Durham or Raleigh!) 
* Bright and cheery inside the house (lots of natural light and space!) 
* Great oversized deck in the back that's perfect for grilling   entertaining! 
* Recently renovated kitchen!! Brand NEW stainless steel appliances and tile! 

If any of that sounded like your cup of tea - shoot me an PM! Pictures of the house and room can be provided on request. Also, feel free to PM me with any questions! :)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Casting 720 and 1080 HD mkvs via Chromecast + Plex? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-15 19:57:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I got a Chromecast way back when it first came out but wasn't too impressed with it's ability to play local HD video files (stutter, low quality stream, and lack of certain video/audio support) so I gave that one to my parents. 

A friend recently told me about the Chromecast + Plex solution that's available now for streaming local files so I'm thinking about buying another one (especially since they're on sale right now). 

My question for you guys is this: how is your experience with the HD playback with Chromecast + Plex? My up/down is 40Mpbs/5Mpbs and I would be running plex off of a 4 year old computer that is i5 dual processor and 4 GB of ram. The majority (~80%) of my files are 10-30GB mkvs, but I also have some smaller mp4s as well.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-01-17 18:01:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since a lot of people are coming in with a couple of thousand words written, consider using this additional rule for the challenge: extra words written in a certain week don't carry over. So even if you have 1,000 words written and you are ahead for week 1 (100 words written), this count doesn't carry over and you STILL have to write 200 words for week 2. 

Just my two cents.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> The 52 Week Writing Challenge [More Details Inside] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-17 00:07:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **TL;DR up top: I invite everyone to join me on my 52 Week Writing Challenge. Every week you will write 100 more words than the week before... so that at the end of 52 weeks of continuous writing, you will have produced 137,800 written words, equivalent to a 500+ novel.**

It's simple: start small, build a routine, form the habit, and WRITE.

We're all aspiring writers here. But it's not a secret that it's hard to find time to sit down and actually commit to writing after a long day at the office or a long night of homework and so you tell yourself "Oh, I'll do it tomorrow". Well, eventually tomorrow turns into next week and next week turns into next month, and sure enough - *another year has gone by*. 

But there's Nanowrimo you say. True, but for someone who writes a few thousand words every couple of months, the idea of finishing 50,000 words in one month is *absolutely daunting*. That's an average of 1,666 words everyday!

So how exactly do we become comfortable with doing this? Practice. Routine. You do it so many times that your brain just does it unconsciously and naturally. Think about it... from touch typing in the dark to playing the unmarked strings of a violin, these are not things that were picked up or developed in a day. It was drilled in through sheer repetition and routine. That's what I hope to accomplish this year with my writing challenge. 

Start small. No one started by playing Beethoven concertos... we all have to begin with Twinkle Twinkle Little Star or Mary Had a Little Lamb or something equally mundane. Start small and easy and repeat and gradually build on it.  

So I was inspired by the slew of new year's posts on reddit by proud people who had just completed the 52 Week Money Challenge (which was in turn originally inspired by the following [blog post](http://savingabuck.com/2013/01/try-the-52-week-money-challenge-for-2013/).) I decided to tweak this for my own purposes. 

**So it's simple.** Week 1, you will write 100 words. Easy-peasy, right? Awesome. Week 2, you will write 200 words. Psh, still easy. Week 3, write 300 words... you see where I'm going with this right? **Every week you will write 100 more words than the week before... so that at the end of 2014 and at the end of 52 weeks of continuous writing, you will have produced 137,800 written words, equivalent to a 500+ novel.**

**With that said, I would like to invite everyone here at /r/writing to join me in this challenge.**

So at the end of this year, **we** will all not only have written a complete novel but more importantly we will have developed a consistent weekly routine of writing so that the next 100,000 words will come so quickly and so simply we will look back and wonder what exactly was holding us back all those years ago. 

Personally, I'll be starting a [blog](http://52weekwritingchallenge.blogspot.com/) to chronicle this (mis)adventure though I will be posting to this subreddit regularly as well. I'm putting myself out there so that I might feel some sort of accountability on my part to actually stick this out throughout the rest of the year. 

For those who want to keep track of their writing and word counts throughout the year, here is a copy of a [simple template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFevF2WQhWsdEN6VEVtWnJfQVpUanZGaHFGNE5sLUE usp=sharing) I created for myself. You can copy and paste it onto your own file if you want to use it.

(I know it's already 1/16 and we've already missed the first two weeks worth of writing! Well, I will be doing a little catch up this week to catch up to week 3, but feel free to start your challenge ANY TIME and go for 52 weeks!) 

EDIT: So some people have expressed interest in creating a separate group to track progress and/or engage with each other. Personally, I will only posting snippets but I think checking in with each other to make sure we're all on track is a good idea. If you are interested, **please join /r/52wkwritingchallenge**! Otherwise, feel free to use the google spreadsheet above to track your progress yourself!

EDIT 2: Since a lot of people are coming in with a couple of thousand words written, **consider using this additional rule for the challenge: extra words written in a certain week don't carry over.** So even if you have 1,000 words written and you are ahead for week 1 (100 words written), this count doesn't carry over and you STILL have to write 200 words for week 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long story short: I bought a short sale house that was empty for at least 8 months before I moved in. This is the sad state of my front yard (the back yard is actually fine which is weird). The front of the house faces southeast. Since it's mostly weed than grass, I guess torching it all and replanting would be my best bet. But I have zero experience and I'm also a small female person - what should my plan of action be?

<TEXT> Hey guys, I just bought a house with no appliances so I'm looking into buying a whole set (stove, fridge, washer, dryer, etc). I've applied for two credit cards with good sign up bonuses (Chase Sapphire Preferred/Citi AA) but I'm wondering if there's any other ways I can rack up some good points or rewards while I'm doing all that. I'm most likely going to be buying at Lowe's/Home Depot. Anyone know of any good coupons for these stores?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recently bought a house - question on AC issues/leak on upstairs unit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-21 13:32:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all - I recently bought a short sale and it was sold as-is with some issues to the upstairs AC. It's not blowing cold air and I got a service guy to come out and he said there was a leak and I was low on roughly two pounds of refrigerant (it's a 2.5 ton split unit). He also said it was most likely the coil which would cost roughly $1500 to replace (and I did not have him perform the leak search.) The guy said I could try to fill it up with refrigerant but if the leak was bad, it would just quickly leak out again. 

My question is this - since the house was unoccupied (and power was shut off) for about 6-8 months before I moved in do you guys think that the leak is actually somewhat small and it was mostly due to the AC being off for a long period of time? (The guy told me that ACs with leaks will actually lose more refrigerant when off as opposed to on.) I was thinking of just adding some refrigerant for now to get it up and running. I have alot of other house related expenses and I'd rather not repair for $1500 or replace for $5000... 

Also, bonus question - I got quoted $5300 for a 13 SEER Carrier and $6900 for a 16 SEER Carrier (in Raleigh, NC). Are those prices somewhat in line with what's to be expected? Also, heard prices for replacement might be cheaper in the fall - should I hold off if I do elect to go the replacement route? How much cheaper would it be? 

Thanks for any help with this!  </TEXT>

First is the shower - it looks like someone used caulk maybe instead of grout here? What is the proper way to remove and re-do using proper materials? 

Second, the bathtub has a small missing ding in it. What's the best way to fill it and cover up? It's on the far side of the tub so water leakage isn't a major concern.

Deck pics: http://imgur.com/a/xJpMa

A little background: house was built in 1999, no structural issues. 

1. Would I be able to to just replace the warped boards by removing the individual boards and getting a new piece to replace at say Lowe's? Is this as simple as it getting them up and screwing in new boards?
2. What is the best way to seal the deck and prevent this from happening in the future?

<TITLE> Kitchen Tiling Questions/Run Through - 1st Time DIYer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-14 16:19:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys, 

I'm about to close on my first house and the first thing I want to do (before I put appliances in) is tile the kitchen. I'm a total DIY beginner but I have been reading up and watching videos on the tiling BUT I just want to run through my plan and ask questions beforehand to make sure nothing goes wrong. Just for reference, house is from 1999 so fairly new. 

Currently there is vinyl in the kitchen (which looks like is over plywood - http://imgur.com/AGbdy4t ):

1. Score vinyl with utility cutter. 
2. Peel up. 
3. Remove plywood (EDIT: someone said there's probably plywood there and needs to be removed) 

Now for actual flooring: 

1. Use modified thinset between subfloor and Ditra. Spread and stick it on. 
2. Use non-modified thinset above between Ditra and tile. (But must use latex additive for porcelain tile? Does it apply to ceramic as well?) 

Some general questions: 

1. How long does it take to dry between all the layers? I've heard it takes awhile - up to a week?
2. How do I tile around/cut the tile to work for this vent? (By the window - http://imgur.com/3o1Zk0W) I have read some stuff about using a wetsaw, but is there no other way to do it? I am planning on using a snapper.
3. I am planning on doing a diagonal pattern, are there any guidelines or suggestions where to start? (For example, for just straight squares it is recommended you start in the center and work outwards.) 
4. If I decide to go with Wonderboard instead, do I need pay attention to how I screw it down? Or just evenly spaced works? 

I would also like any recommendations on the following tools: 

-Tile snapper (or saw if that's better) 

-Modified Thinset (Someone recommended Versabond) 

-Unmodified Thinset (Someone recommended Laticrete ? on the actual one) 

-Places to buy cheap tile? (The best I've found is .86 ceramic tile that's on sale at HD) 

Is there anything else I've forgotten or failed to think of? 

Thanks for any and all help!! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Want Some Manga Recs (from 2009+ onwards) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-25 07:01:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I used to read a lot of manga when I was high school, but pretty much stopped once I got to college. I recently caught myself up with Billy Bat and it just reminded me of how awesome manga can be. So I'm looking for recommendations of newer series, specifically ones that started after 2009. I'm slightly flexible on this but try not to recommend things that started way before this date bc changes are I will have read it or heard of it already. 

I read pretty much any genre, though I like plot/character driven ones and dislike mangas that are super fanservice-y. 

To give you some idea of things I liked from before: FMA, Rurouni Kenshin, anything by Naoki Urasawa, One Piece, Death Note, Flame of Recca, Eden, Jiraishin, Goth, Black Lagoon, anything by Kaori Yuki, stuff by CLAMP, Bleach, Anatolia Story/Red River, Basara, 7 Seeds, Hikaru no Go, Prince of Tennis, random things by Mitsuru Adachi, Hana Yori Dango, Hanakimi, Ouran High School Host Club. This is just off the top of my head to give you a sampling of mangas that've enjoyed in the past. 

Appreciate any recs! Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question] Started wearing makeup regularly for work - is it causing my skin blemishes, etc? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-20 20:15:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm not much of a makeup user, but I started wearing makeup regularly for work (9-5 everyday) after college and I've noticed that my skin has now has blemishes and bumps and just other general imperfections that definitely didn't exist before. I've never broken out and it doesn't turn red or irritated, but my skin was definitely much clearer and smoother before I started regularly using makeup. My mom's has commented on this several times whenever I visit so I don't think it's just me. 

Since I'm no make expert, do you guys think it's the quality of the makeup I'm using? Or maybe the brands I'm using is not good for my skin? My skin is not particularly oily or dry, though it does very occasionally get dry. 

My usual face make up is L'Oreal powder foundation and Milani blush. I almost always take it off immediately after work using baby wipes. (I didn't start using baby wipes until about a year ago, but do you guys think that might have also contributed a little? I used to use Target brand make up remover wipes.)  

I'll take any suggestions, comments or even recommendations for different brands. If it makes a difference, I'm Asian and have had fairly good skin in the past (never really any break outs, acne, etc).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best way to alter a dress that's a bit too small? (pictures/details inside) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-16 21:03:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys, so I recently bought an olive dress at H M that is just a little bit too small. It was on sale and I loved it so I said why not. It zips up in the back, but my entire torso feels like it's in a corset - chest and stomach areas are being completely compressed and in a way thats not acceptable to wear out in public. 

I probably need half an inch around the waist and maybe a little more around the chest area (I can get these measured when I take it to tailor's). Since they'll probably need to add fabric to it and I feel like it's going to be pretty hard, if not impossible to find fabric that matches the dress, **where and what do you guys think is the best to add onto this dress to make it bigger?** I was thinking a stretchy black strip down the back where the zipper is or possibly along the sides under the arm. This only needs to be added to the torso part of the dress. 

Here are some pictures of me wearing it (a bit hard to see the bad fit due to the light): [Here](http://imgur.com/a/bdVQ7/)  

Here are some more pics of the dress I found online (clearer pictures): [Here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLl5FSNPwiw/UVh3qXxPg4I/AAAAAAAAEcQ/vLi4X97Booo/s1600/h m+olive+sheath+dress+.jpg)

<TEXT> Hey guys, I'll probably be heading to Shanghai sometime this year or next year - wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a good (and relatively cheap) place to get glamor shots? Specifically I mean the places where they do all your makeup, have a wardrobe, do the touchup and usually give you a book and also a large print afterwards.

By cheap, I mean  cheap on American standards so I'm looking for maybe the $300-$500 range? Is that sound reasonable? But if you have good places that are more than that - please shoot those over too. 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Short sale advice - two offer situation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-09 16:31:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The situation: I found a short sale that I really liked about 2-3 weeks ago and I put an offer in on it (full asking price with conventional loan 20% down). I found out yesterday that there is now an all cash offer that is "in line" with my offer (which I assume is a little lower but close to my offer). My realtor says that banks/sellers look very favorably on all cash offers just because there are no contingencies or risk involved. 

Is the bank really more likely to take a 250k cash offer over a 260k financed offer? Don't they get the money anyways in one go? Do I just need to prove I am no risk buyer? 

I really like this house and would like to get it. Can you guys give me some advice/help on a couple of things: 

* Does the bank consider my offer first since I submitted it 2-3 weeks ago or will they look at both with equal consideration? 
* If I increase my % down to 40-50% or get a 15 yr mortgage, will that help show that I am more than financially capable of buying and I am strong serious buyer? Will that hold up at all against the cash offer at all? 
* Will increasing my offer by 5k (it's a 260k house) be more of a draw than the above method? 
* Would it be completely not ok if I tracked down the seller himself and just flat out asked him what price the other cash offer was so I can compete directly with it? 

I appreciate any help guys.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recs on what to buy SO. (specific tastes) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all! My boyfriend has recently started to get into drinking whiskey and I'd like to surprise him with a bottle of something nice. I'm fairly clueless when it comes to whiskey - the closest I ever get is a nice Old Fashioned or Washington Apple. I know he has a bottle of Auchentoshan right now that he's been drinking and he seems to like that. He's mentioned that he likes Jameson and that he dislikes Johnny Walker (because it had a weird taste to him?). 

I don't really understand the differences, can you guys give me some recs on what to buy him based on the above? And nothing that will break the bank please. If you could split your recs into whiskeys under $50 and those between $50-$100 that would be great. Thanks!! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm thinking of buying a house to rent out - I've mostly been looking Cary and Raleigh (West of downtown). Does anyone have any areas they would recommend to rent out to professionals and college kids (Raleigh?) as opposed to families (Cary)? 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

EDIT: Including below comment for more info: 
I'm planning on living in this place for the first couple of years and then renting it out afterwards. My current thoughts are Cary because it will hold value (but houses are a little more pricey and it's suburbia) or downtown Raleigh (much older, small homes but rent to young professionals due to location). Plus, Raleigh is consistently ranked as highest growing/best for professionals/etc city in US so I wonder if buying there is better in the long term if I'm planning on holding onto this place for 10-20 years? Do you think Cary value will experience the same sort of bump because of Raleigh being up and coming?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandfather passed away earlier today and my parents don't really know where to start. They wish to cremate my grandfather's remains but we also need a small service/showing (I'm not really sure how this works) beforehand (just for 6 of us, nothing fancy required). My parents need a place that's affordable. We live around Palmetto Bay/Pinecrest. Any advice or recommendations would be extremely helpful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys - has it been confirmed if all 4 DLCs will have zombie maps? I'm debating whether or not to buy this if my sole reason for getting the DLCs is the zombie maps. (And I already have Nuketown.) I don't want to wind up paying more if one of these 4 doesn't have a zombie map. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question: Does the highest rounds not save if someone backs out?  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-22 22:41:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been running into this problem lately where half the time my highest rounds won't save on any random map (this has happened on Town and Nuketown so far). Other than the game/network being messed up, my theory is that if someone backs out halfway through, it won't save the highest round. FYI, I'm playing on PSN. 

Can someone confirm or deny this?
