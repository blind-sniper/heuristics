There are also temporal effects such a time slowing down. It usually occurs before they fall asleep or after they wake up.

<TEXT> As a medical student and crossfitter, I have had the same issue while doing cleans so I completely understand your frustration and pain. I know I can probably pull more, but the pain limits the weight I carry as it hurts more with increased weight. I realized cleaning uses a lot of muscle groups including abduction and flexion of the shoulders. This creates a lot of strain on the supraspinatus muscles, which you can test with your arms pointed out at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal, thumbs pointed down, and ask someone to push your hands down while you push up against their hands. If that recreates the pain, you most likely have supraspinatus strain and/or some type of labrum tear. MRI or not, the first line of treatment is ibuprofen and rest and then physical therapy exercises to strengthen the accessory muscles. Surgery is last resort to reattach the torn labrum. For me, I get pain deep in the shoulder as well as some biceps tendon tenderness. I try to limit the weight and not go over 80% of my 1RM. I also noticed the faster you get your elbows under, the less weight strain on your shoulders so a lot is perfecting technique. Let me know if this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw the same thing happen, except it was an average guy running full speed on the treadmill. It was very early in the morning so the gym was relatively empty. He slipped, and the treadmill shot him straight back, his towel flying into his face. Dazed and confused, he looked around to see if anyone saw. I did, but he didn't realize so he tried to get back on, without realizing that the treadmill was still on full speed. He slipped again, fell on his knees and got shit backwards into the stationary bikes. Probably one of the funniest things I've seen at the gym.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Who else would like to see up here? I definitely cannot stand Tejada this year. I know it is way too early to DFA him and experts would bash this move as a bad way of running a franchise. But at what point would you think 'hmm, this guy's season isn't going to turn around'? He is bad on offense, bad on defense (he seems worse at short than 3B), and is a constant letdown with runners in scoring position. At $6 million for this one year, I would say he ranks as one of the worst in franchise history. Off the top of my head, the only other horrible signing I remember would be Alfonzo. Thoughts? Discuss. </TEXT>
