I then in Excel, divided the working age population data of Britain and France with their real GDP, PPP from 1950 to 2013.

In Excel, I then detrended the growth rates of real GDP, PPP per British and French by 1.9% to identify eras of the above than by the low average growth in these countries. 

I then annotated the resulting chart with the classic descriptions of eras such as "never had it so good", "British disease" and Thatcheromics.

A nice discussion of the role of motivated reasoning in rejecting scientific findings.

In modern politics, you don't give an inch so you reject the science because you don't like the economic solutions that would result even though you may have independent and valid reasons on economic grounds for rejecting the proposed solutions. It's a tactical mistake to concede anything in modern politics </TEXT>

Libertarians do attract a lot of comment and the Twitter Left is rather keen to label the right-wing opponents, as libertarians. This is despite the fact a lot of voters don't understand what a libertarian is.

Indeed, back in the 1990s, most libertarian gatherings were so small that they would not need to book ahead at a restaurant to make sure they got a table.

It is only recently that Milton Friedman became a respectable figure in policy circles. Indeed, at job interviews in the 1990s, if you mentioned Hayek's name, and there is any sign of name recognition, you would been interviewed by a very well read people. </TEXT>

Nice little paper pointing out what should be obvious to everyone. Nonviolent protest can entice sympathy and support from the majority. Violent protests have the exact opposite effect, including a law and order backlash among voters.

Roundabout way of saying that a Republican won the 1968 election on a law and order platform, not a Democrat on a peace platform.

As I recall my warned over Marxism, is the idea of violent protests to exit provoked that backlash and the resulting repression cause the proletariat to see that capitalists for whom they are and rise up and overthrow them.

<TEXT> All agree that the consumer price index (CPI) is biased and overstates inflation. In 1996, economists hired by the Senate Finance Committee estimated that the U.S. CPI overstates annual inflation by 1.1% (Boskin et al. 1996). That estimated CPI bias has not gotten smaller with time. It is now up to 1.5%, even 2%.

I thought I might see what happened if I I used Excel two take account of this one and a half percentage point annual bias because of new goods, quality variation and other known biases in the CPI estimates for the USA, UK and Japan in the relevant OECD StatExtract database for annual CPI inflation.

I constructed this series with Excel using working age population data from OECD StatExtract and total hours worked data from the conference board total database. These series started in 1950 or 1956.

I then used Excel to construct average tax rates on labour income from Cara McDaniel's website to calculate average tax rates on labour incomes in the USA, Germany and France since 1950 to explore reasons for the differences between the Max Roser tweet data and mine.

<TEXT> SUBMISSION STATEMENT

When Brennan said at a tax reform conference in Australia over 20 years ago that efficient taxes and tax reforms are both bad because they lead to higher taxes and a larger government, no one understood him.

Idealists all, the audience, including me, assumed they were advising a benevolent government, not a revenue-maximising leviathan government  a beast that needed to be staved with constitutional constraints on the number and size of tax bases and tax instruments.

Fiscal arrangements were analysed by Buchanan and Brennan in The Power to Tax in terms of the preferences of citizen-taxpayers who are permitted at some constitutional level of choice to select the fiscal institutions they are to be subject to over an uncertain future.

Those in elected office are assumed to exploit the powers assigned to them to the maximum possible extent: government is a revenue-maximising leviathan.

Buchanan and Brennan were all for inefficient tax systems because they do not raise as much revenue. A government that cannot raise much revenue cannot grow very large.

It was a number of years before I came to agree with Brennan and Buchanan. I had to break out of my applied welfare economics thinking and move over to constitutional political economy.

Tax reform saved the late 20th century welfare state by raising the same or more revenue with less taxpayer resistance. </TEXT>

Leaving to one side the Federal prohibition against interstate competition in health care plans, and any state mandates as to what must be in ill health care plan, two considerable asides, all the is saying is there is an entrepreneurial opportunity to win business in health insurance by offering simple plans that are cheap to administer.

The extent that administratively complex plan survive in competition rather than because of mandates, suggest that consumers are willing to pay for whatever they buy. </TEXT>

No one doubts the sincerity of Alcoholics Anonymous and those who participate and organise that movement. This article argues that its treatment programme has simply been overtaken by events and more effective options are available.

This is important both in terms of coping with alcoholism and the fact that some people are required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous as part of sentences imposed by courts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually disagree with the Australian system which I used to be subject to. 

First, people save far too much for their retirement. So much so, that they'll be wealthier in their retirement, if they make it that far, than they were during their working lives.

Secondly, there are required to save for their retirement before they have bought other basic things such as a car and a house deposit.

The practical upshot of the Australian system is that low paid workers save for their own retirement rather than rely on an means tested old age pension that would be funded by taxes on the middle-class. These low paid workers are in the peculiar position of having retirement savings but not enough savings to buy a house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> david Friedman argues on this that
"the employer who insists on an employee signing a non- competition agreement will find that he must pay, in additional wages or other terms of employment, the cost that the agreement imposes upon the employee, as measured by the employee and revealed in his actions.

It follows that the employer will insist on such an agreement only if he believes that its value to him is greater than its cost to the employee The contract is designed, after all, with the objective of getting the other party to sign it."

<TEXT> Measles affects about 20 million people a year, primarily in the developing areas of Africa and Asia. It resulted in about 96,000 deaths in 2013 down from 545,000 deaths in 1990. In 1980, the disease is estimated to have caused 2.6 million deaths per year. 

Before immunization in the United States between three and four million cases occurred a year. Most of those who are infected and who die are less than five years old. Adults have little or no memory of before the age of 4.

The risk of death among those infected is usually 0.2%. Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus. 

Herd immunity requires at least 92% vaccination rate; the vaccine is only 95% effective; babies are too young to vaccinate; and tort liability is an ineffective way of policing infections from you see http://utopiayouarestandinginit.com/2015/02/07/richard-epstein-classical-liberalism-and-compulsory-vaccinations/ </TEXT>

Roland Fryer carried a gun at 14 as a member of the gang; worked extra jobs at college to pay off his father's bail bondsman; and an assistant professor at Harvard at the age of 27. He is the sharpest economist around working on the economics of inequality and discrimination.

When they arrived, they were given the film that they were going to make. The promise was broken.

When they reviewed the film given to them by the North Korean authorities, they are more than happy to put it out as their documentary because every single frame unintentionally sent North Korea up because of the sycophancy etc. </TEXT>

Stephen Stigler attributed his law to Robert Mertons law of multiples, acknowledging that Stiglers law obeys Stiglers law.

<TEXT> Thanks, the law and economics of criminal justice does not seem to be as accepted as widely as I thought.

Some of the first articles in law and economics by Richard Posner and William Landes were on the economics of the courts, legal administration and the judiciary as a whole.

When Gary Becker wrote the economics of discrimination, many simply did not accept that it was a topic for economic analysis. Likewise, when he wrote Human Capital in 1964, he later explained that is book had such a long subtitle to overcome criticism of describing people as capital. </TEXT>

<TEXT> correct. A big policy dilemma when setting in income thresholds for means testing the incomes of welfare beneficiaries is you can make the welfare benefit pay.

In New Zealand, you can earn $200 a week without losing any of your welfare benefits. That makes part-time work plus a single parent welfare benefit a viable investment.

There is an argument that welfare benefits should rebate dollar for dollar on any income earned to ensure that the gap between working and not working is large and the rewards are to work full time, rather than work part time and staying on the benefit, including its various second-tier benefits related to health costs and emergency grants. </TEXT>

As for crime related murders, the large fall in crime rates in recent times as discussed well in the writings of Steve Levitt. He points out that executions are simply too infrequent to figure in criminal calculations regarding risks.

Furthermore, gang bangers, a spell on death row probably extends life expectancy relative to been murdered by business associate in a drug dispute.

The Rand Corporation did a very good starting about 10 years ago the occupational hazards of drug gang members. being murdered is a far greater occupational hazard than arrest.

<TEXT> Well if they want to meet with the convicted offender, they are free to contact the police or the court to arrange to do so.

The Ministry of Justice should never contact the victims  that is re-victimisation. 

Enough people complain about the trauma of having to testify in court and be cross examined. Once that is over, the victim should be free to get on with their life and never hear from the court again once they have completed their testimony. after giving their testimony, it is for the victim to decide whether to have further contact with the criminal justice system.

Why is the sentencing deferred pending a restorative justice conference?

If the offender who pled guilty is genuinely remorseful, that remorse will not be contingent on a reduction in sentence because he or she attended a restorative justice conference?

<TEXT> judges are now forced to adjourn all cases after a guilty plea to give Ministry of Justice conference facilitators time to coax offenders and victims to come together. 

I can think of plenty of cases, including the two examples given in the article, with the victim would never want to see or hear of their attacker ever again except that there been sentenced to an appropriate term prison.

People complain about giving evidence in court been a traumatic experience. Imagine having to meet with the offender again so they can pretend to be remorseful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "This paper provides a relatively non-technical survey of theoretical research on the eect of sovereign risk on the market for sovereign debt, with an emphasis on the way sovereign risk constrains the
process of globalization. 

After summarizing the legal environment governing sovereign debt, it discusses the forces that encourage repayment of sovereign debt when legal enforcement is ineffective.  It then reviews the recent literature that examines the quantitative importance of these forces. 

It concludes by discussing a range of institutional changes and policy reforms that might act to further reduce the level of sovereign risk and hence strengthen the process of globalization."

<TEXT> Many a war criminal would go free without the ability to criminalise organisations.

"Joint criminal enterprise" ("JCE") is a mode of liability created by judges on the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that allows the tribunal to bring charges against members of a group responsible for war crimes or crime against humanity even if there is no evidence that the particular individuals physically participated in the crimes.

Germany prescribed a successor to the Nazi party when it started winning seats in the State and Federal parliaments. 

This party was led by the SS major who was at the centre of the coup attempt in 1944  initially he was ordered to arrest all the Nazi leaders; then Hitler got on the phone to him and he arrested the coup leaders. He was an unrepentant Nazi.

Once we go in front of the veil of ignorance and find out that we are the one missing out on that drug, naturally, our views will change.

<TEXT> This LSE link is an affirmation of doorknocking. It is consistent with the economic concept of expressive voting.

Models of expressive voting postulate that voters consume ideological or moral stances on issues by voting for them, even when they are against the voters own narrow self interest. Expressive voting is more likely if the probability of being a decisive voter is low - the election is not close.

People vote to express certain beliefs. Voting gives a sense of identity and purpose. Expressive voting is equated to cheering for sporting teams. People vote in ways that cheer for good things and boo at bad thing.

This is why higher income people vote Green  this allows them to feel good about themselves (and perhaps then get on with climbing the greasy pole After cleansing themselves with a morally attuned vote).

Another way to find identity and purpose is to vote for a particular candidate because he asked you personally - you're doing him a favour. Good people do favours and listen to arguments and personal appeals. </TEXT>

The drawback of these studies as with others is that a particular focus on the fact that people's voting patterns changes they get older, they get more conservative.

They often lack a gender analysis: women are much more likely to change their vote than men depending on whether they are single, married, a single parent or recently divorced. This vote switching is driven by the demand for social insurance in different family circumstances. </TEXT>

These reports he writes of the statistical bible of income and poverty in New Zealand. His reports is written with the relevant statistics using public and unit record data.

The facts are: gini coefficient has not increased in New Zealand for 20 years, the share of the top 1% have not increased for 20 years, child poverty is the same as it was 20 years ago, income increases over the last 20 years of been spread fairly evenly across all 10 income deciles.

All of these results are in his 235 page report with most of the key diagrams in his summary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Labor input growth during the recovery of the U.S. economy from the Great Recession of 20082009 has been considerably lower than expected. A number of scholars have attributed this disappointing outcome to the prospect of higher taxes, induced by the fiscal imbalances that will materialize in coming decades under current policies.

The paper finds that the empirical relevance of the fiscal sentiment hypothesis depends on whether this Frisch elasticity of labor supply is closer to the relatively large values needed to account for the observed volatility of labor input at business cycle frequencies, than to the lower values estimated by microeconomic and quasi-experimental studies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> see also Taxation and Market Work: Is Scandinavia an Outlier?
Richard Rogerson at http://www.nber.org/papers/w12890

Abstract: 

This paper argues that it is essential to explicitly consider how the government spends tax revenues when assessing the effects of tax rates on aggregate hours of market work. 

Different forms of government spending imply different elasticities of hours of work with regard to tax rates. 

I illustrate the empirical importance of this point by addressing the issue of hours worked and tax rates in three sets of economies: the US, Continental Europe and Scandinavia. 

While tax rates are highest in Scandinavia, hours worked in Scandinavia are significantly higher than they are in Continental Europe. 

I argue that differences in the form of government spending can potentially account for this pattern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abstract:
To generate big responses of unemployment to productivity shocks in a business cycle context or to productivity changes in a welfare state context, researchers have reconfigured matching models in various ways, e.g., by elevating the utility of leisure, by making wages sticky, by assuming alternating-offer wage bargaining, by introducing fixed matching costs, by modelling costly acquisition of credit, or by positing government mandated unemployment benefits, layoff costs, and taxes. 

All of these redesigned matching models increase responses of unemployment to movements in productivity through a common intermediating channel that we call the fundamental surplus fraction.


The fundamental surplus fraction is an upper bound on the fraction of a jobs output that the invisible hand can allocate to vacancy creation. All such models generate larger unemployment responses to movements in productivity by making the fundamental surplus fraction smaller.

The preface of the calculus of consent explicitly identifies which chapters were mostly written by James Buchanan, which were written by Gordon Tullock.

Abstract:      
Until the 1970s, Hong Kong's Government collected as few statistics as possible, a policy only partially explained by its commitment to laisser faire. Statistics were seen as threatening its freedom from London's control and its ability to limit political debate locally. Using unpublished material from the Hong Kong Public Records Office, this paper reviews statistical issues of major importance in Hong Kong's transition to an industrial economy and its emergence as a financial centre. It demonstrates how the quality of statistics affected the management of financial markets and banking crises, and identifies the wider costs of the shortage of comprehensive statistics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most are those who support the minimum wage shift gears their applied welfare economics in all other social context to emphasise how the losers should be given priority and greater weight when adding up the social gains and social losses of economic change.

The social cost of the minimum wage is not discussed in this way: how many jobs are lost and that these job losses are much more important than any gains to society. All that is done is the number of jobs lost is compared with some other social metrics such as how much the wages go up for those that still have a job and that is enough to conclude that there is a socially beneficial change from a minimum wage increase.

Any low paid workers affected by the minimum wage increase are just reduced to numbers and added and subtracted with great ease and few moral compunctions about interpersonal comparisons of utility

A minimum wage increase is not free if one worker loses their job. The Paretian Criterion states that welfare is said to increase or decrease if at least one person is made better off or worse off with no change in the positions of others. </TEXT>

The revolution in popular music occurred at a time when young innovators were making similar transformations in other arts: Jean-Luc Godard and his fellow New Wave directors created a conceptual revolution in film in the early '60s, just as Andy Warhol and other Pop artists made painting a conceptual activity. </TEXT>

Richard J. Cebula, Franklin G. Mixon Jr. Empirical economics 2012
Abstract
This study investigates the impact of ending the military draft on voter turnout in the U.S. The main study period runs from 1948 through 2006. After controlling for the unemployment rate, the degree of labor force unionization, the U.S.-Iraq War, the impact of voting in presidential elections, the female labor force participation rate, the percent of the adult population with a college degree, income, and a variable to reflect strong approval or disapproval of the U.S. President, compelling empirical evidence is found that ending the military draft in the U.S. acted to significantly reduce the aggregate voter participation rate.

<TEXT> from abstract: The top 1 percent of households hold over a third of the country's total wealth, while the bottom two quintiles hold a fraction of that wealth. 

As such, the rich are able to develop and maintain highly diversified portfolios of investments, including stocks, bonds, derivatives, insurance, precious metals, degrees, multiple homes and other real estate holdings. 

The ability of the rich to safely diversity their portfolios allows them to take on riskier investments without incurring the hazards associated with the far less diverse portfolios of lower income individuals. </TEXT>

Pre-2000 Krugman has a ton of solid economic analysis (like this), and I wish he produced more of it nowadays. 

So true. Krugman went off the rails when bush was elected

<TEXT> It took it time to concede that point.

The economics of the minimum wage is a curious area of public debate.

People are very much anti-economics, but as soon as an argument comes up that vaguely supports the minimum wage not harming unemployment, they become extremely knowledgeable of that entire literature in all its nuances.

We are now discussing whether on the best possible interpretation of the employment effects of the minimum wage been minimal whether a minimum wage increase can actually implemented without harming employment. 

The answer to that question is no. 

Much easier to just increase the earned income tax credit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Noah Smith is full of it. Economics was never a priesthood of free markets.

Milton Friedman was a wild man in the wings until late in his life. Hayek had trouble getting up a job after about 1950.

If you mentioned Milton Friedman in a job interview before about 1995 or thereabouts, that was very career limiting. If you mentioned Hayek's name at a job interview and there was any sign of name recognition, that was evidence that you would been interviewed by well-read people.

A great many economists started out as socialists. There was great resistance to public choice within the profession and it is still is not well recognised in basic textbooks.

As correctly cited in the article the average economist is a moderate Democrat. That is a shift to the right, not to the left.

Economists are more likely to vote Democratic than Republican by a margin of 5 to 2; and even the Republican-voting economists tended to favour a lot of government intervention.

As for the Austrian School, that was so small until the late 1990s that they wouldn't need to book ahead for the table at a restaurant. </TEXT>

This Act was passed in 1689 in response to the mutiny of a large portion of the army which stayed loyal to James II.

The 1689 Bill of Rights also prohibited a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament.

A new Mutiny Act was passed each year until 1879.

 I'm a big fan of Fama's work on anomalies. They certainly have played a role in the development and establishment of neoclassical ideas about financial econ. I was nearly involved in quite similar research on bond markets. 

**BUT**

With that said, his ideas are in competition with other ideas about movements of asset values, which are also considered "mainstream" these days. 

Behavioral econ, for instance, which discards the idea of "homo-economicus".

<TEXT> "the man is arguing that concentration of the world's wealth into the hands of a small couple of people is a bad idea from an economic perspective."

No he is not. Krugman is moralising about distributive justice.

John Rawls is often put forward as the starting point for political philosophy of political progressives. Rawls was interested in the implications of different social institutions for his conception of justice as fairness.

Rawls pointed out that behind the veil of ignorance, people will agree to inequality as long as it is to everyones advantage. Rawls was awake to the power of incentives.

Rawls lent qualified support to the idea of a flat-rate consumption tax (see A Theory of Justice pp. 278-79). He said a proportional expenditure tax may be part of the best scheme and adding that such a tax can contain all the usual exemptions. 

The reason why Rawls lent qualified support to the idea of a flat-rate consumption tax was these taxes what people take out of the common store of goods rather than what he or she contributes.

Incomes tax must be opposed on social justice grounds, but not progressive consumption taxes. 

Given that the super-rich top 0.1% do not spend much of their incomes, they are grossly over-taxed relative to what they take out of the common store of goods.!

He preferred progressive consumption taxes, according to Rawls, it imposes a levy according to how much a person takes out of the common store of goods and not according to how much he contributes. 

A simple way to have a progressive consumption tax is to exempt all savings from taxation. A taxable consumption is calculated as income minus savings minus a large standard deduction.

With his emphasis on fair distribution through state initiatives, Rawlss initial appeal is mainly to the left, but left-wing thinkers also found his acceptance of capitalism reactionary and his tolerance of social discrepancies unpalatable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alchian (1969) lists three ways to adjust to unanticipated demand fluctuations:
	output adjustments;
	wage and price adjustments; and
	Inventories and queues (including reservations).

Alchian (1969) suggests that there is no reason for wage and price changes to be used regardless of the relative cost of these other options:
	The cost of output adjustment stems from the fact that marginal costs rise with output;
	The cost of price adjustment arises because uncertain prices and wages induce costly search by buyers and sellers seeking the best offer; and
	The third method of adjustment has holding and queuing costs.

There is a tendency for unpredicted price and wage changes to induce costly additional search. Long-term contracts including implicit contracts arise to share risks and curb opportunism over sunken investments in relationship-specific capital.

These factors lead to queues, unemployment, spare capacity, layoffs, shortages, inventories and non-price rationing in conjunction with wage stability.

Alchian and Woodwards 1987 Reflections on a theory of the firm says:

 the notion of a quickly equilibrating market price is baffling save in a very few markets.

Imagine an employer and an employee. Will they renegotiate price every hour, or with every perceived change in circumstances? If the employee is a waiter in a restaurant, would the waiters wage be renegotiated with every new customer? Would it be renegotiated to zero when no customers are present, and then back to a high level that would extract the entire customer value when a queue appears?

 But what is the right interval for renegotiation or change in price? The usual answer as soon as demand or supply changes is uninformative.

Alchian and Woodward then go on to a long discussion of the role of protecting composite quasi-rents from dependent resources as the decider of the timing of wage and price revisions.

Alchian and Woodward explain unemployment as a side-effect of the purpose of wage and price rigidity, which is the prevention of hold-ups over dependent assets.

They note that unemployment cannot be understood until an adequate theory of the firm explains the type of contracts the members of a firm make with one another.

Benjamin Kleins theory of rigid wages in American Economic Review in 1984 is one of the few that explored rigid wages as an industrial organisation issue. Klein treated rigid wages as a response to opportunism and hold-up problems over specialised assets and are forms of exclusive dealership or take-or-pay contracts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. see Steven Kaplan and Joshua Rauhs Its the Market: The Broad-Based Rise in the Return to Top Talent Journal of Economic Perspectives 2013 who found that:
 Rising inequality is due to technical changes that allow highly talented individuals or superstars to manage or perform on a much larger scale.

 These superstars can now apply their talents to greater pools of resources and reach larger numbers of people and markets at home and abroad. They thus became more productive, and higher paid.

 Those in the Forbes 400 richest are less likely to have inherited their wealth or grown-up wealthy.
 Todays rich are working rich who accessed education while young and then applied their natural talents and acquired skills to the most scalable industries such as ICT, finance, entertainment, sport and mass retailing.

 The U.S. evidence on income and wealth shares for the top 1% is most consistent with a superstar explanation. This U.S. evidence is less consistent with the gains in earnings of the top 1 percent coming from greater managerial power over the determination of their own pay in the corporate world or changes in social norms about what managers could earn.

Todays super-rich are highly productive because they produce new and better products and services that people want and are willing to pay for.

These rewards for entrepreneurship and hard work guide people of different talents and skills into the occupations and industries where their talents produce the most. The efficient allocation of talent and income maximising occupational choices were important to Rawls framework.

<TEXT>  People who commit murder typically do not think of the consequences in that way (or don't care).

if so, does that not mean you do not have to worry about marginal deterrence and can increase prison terms? see http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Hanged_for_a_Sheep/Hanged_for_a_sheep.html
the intuition that we should keep the punishment for the less serious crime down so as not to tempt offenders to switch to more serious crimes such as to eliminate witnesses etc.

<TEXT> thanks, but I am amazed at the belief on the Left about the influence of the Austrian school and libertarianism on public policy. 

Successful movements are large and their leading lights attract many followers:
-	Until the 1990s, the Austrian school  all of them - would not have to book ahead for a table at a restaurant!
-	After 2000, the Austrian school can still all fit into one room and most would still know each other from the same one or two graduate schools. Most would be recent graduates of George Mason University.
