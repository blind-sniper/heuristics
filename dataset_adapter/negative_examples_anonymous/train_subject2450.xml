<TEXT> The psychedelic state induced by ayahuasca modulates the activity and connectivity of the default mode network.
PLoS ONE
PLoS One 2015 18;10(2):e0118143. Epub 2015 Feb 18.

The experiences induced by psychedelics share a wide variety of subjective features, related to the complex changes in perception and cognition induced by this class of drugs. A remarkable increase in introspection is at the core of these altered states of consciousness. Self-oriented mental activity has been consistently linked to the Default Mode Network (DMN), a set of brain regions more active during rest than during the execution of a goal-directed task. Here we used fMRI technique to inspect the DMN during the psychedelic state induced by Ayahuasca in ten experienced subjects. Ayahuasca is a potion traditionally used by Amazonian Amerindians composed by a mixture of compounds that increase monoaminergic transmission. In particular, we examined whether Ayahuasca changes the activity and connectivity of the DMN and the connection between the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN). Ayahuasca caused a significant decrease in activity through most parts of the DMN, including its most consistent hubs: the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)/Precuneus and the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Functional connectivity within the PCC/Precuneus decreased after Ayahuasca intake. No significant change was observed in the DMN-TPN orthogonality. Altogether, our results support the notion that the altered state of consciousness induced by Ayahuasca, like those induced by psilocybin (another serotonergic psychedelic), meditation and sleep, is linked to the modulation of the activity and the connectivity of the DMN.

<TEXT> From Wikipedia about Byrd's record after his vote on the 1964 Civil Rights Act:

For the 20032004 session, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)[62] rated Byrd's voting record as being 100 percent in line with the NAACP's position on the 33 Senate bills they evaluated. 16 other senators received that rating. In June 2005, Byrd proposed an additional $10 million in federal funding for the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial in Washington, D.C., remarking that, "With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his Dream was the American Dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently."

<TEXT> I don't think police unionization has anything to do with the militarization of the police agencies. Police forces added all these "toys" because they were free or had a minimal cost.

Unions have helped police forces not to use arbitrarily actions to remove officers who do not believe in the consensus opinion of their bosses. Unionization has helped keep dissenting voices on the force. </TEXT>

What makes people look retarded is their attempts to excuse away stereotyping bankers as Jews. This is common imaginary even though most bankers are not Jewish. The idea that you have no sensitivity to the stereotyping says more about you and your political baggage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe Republicans can now understand the CBO report. I doubt it. They never let the facts get in the way of their talking points.

The other part of these 2.3 million FTE jobs is that that they are not being lost but unfilled. Some of those hours will go to the unemployed lowering even further the unemployment rate. Now that is real scary to the GOP and their talking point that the economy can not and will not improve under a Democrat. </TEXT>

Here is the comment made to me by Luster in a response to mod mail.

[I did not remove it, but I agree with its removal](http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1hy7uq)

You can see Luster later in the thread is looking to ban me for being a shill for the AP, the largest new organization in the US. He doesn't even know how AP works. I have never been paid by AP for writing anything. But facts probably will not be enough to stop the r/politics mods from doing what they are going to do. </TEXT>

Home owners leave in the second wave as home prices rise and commodity prices rise. Their $60,000 home is sold for $200,000. The home is resold for $400,000. The home owners do make money but miss out on the windfall.

<TEXT> Having been pioneers of gentrification in a number of neighborhoods I find the study flawed. I am White. I saw the vast majority of people of color displaced. First the renters went but then the home owners sold out because the money they were offered were too much for them not to accept. Also the prices in stores changed upward forcing lower income home owners to seek more affordable communities. 

One neighborhood changed from African-American to White and in the other Hispanic/African-American to White. Just because you don't have to move the economics may make moving the best alternative. In the end the benefits of the new gentrified community changes are lost to the long-time residents renters and home owners. </TEXT>

Troops that were sent by road to free the city were ambushed. The campaign turned the French public against their colonization of Vietnam.

The Tet offensive was a total attack across South Vietnam by VietCong and North Vietnamese forces against US and South Vietnamese forces during Vietnamese New Year in 1968. Fighting was fierce with battles raging in many of the major cities. Supreme firepower by the US won the campaign but the violence turned a majority of Americans against the war, </TEXT>

<TEXT> U/theredditpope has been at the center of the controversy at r/politics. Beyond the banning of sites he has been forcing people to delete posts if they wanted to remain on r/politics. He has deleted posts from discussions without telling the poster. He has refused to listen to criticism and ridiculed redditors on r/politics on other subreddits. His actions will reflect on any site that wants him as a mod.

I wouldn't be a mod on any site he is associated with. He represents the worst of reddit.

It is your choice but I feel you are devaluing r/politic. 

The struggle at r/politics is not limited to one single subreddit but it is actually a fight for the future of reddit as an open and free community. It may sound melodramatic but there are political forces outside of reddit who want to stifle the influence this site has on the internet. It may sound conspiratorial but there is enough evidence to believe this is what is happening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You take on Snooves, who once tried to ban me for posting too frequently from the AP. I want to expand it to the current state of the mods.

Mods like GuitarFreak027 and avnerd have little or no interest in r/politics looking at their user histories. Yet these two mods got or retained full permissions on this site. Others like maxwellhill, anutensil, mrmajorly and Samuel_Gompers who used to have full mod status are relegated to secondary roles even though they are regular participants.

It is these actions along with the banned list that make it seem like there has been a coup. When we look at the political make up of the mods the site has seemed to take a severe turn to the right. This is not a left or progressive site put it does have a majority of users who are left of center. 

The community didn't lose default status because we were too left but because the discussion too often was toxic. The way to improve the site is not to kick out those left of center but to moderate the tone of the community.

The mods have lost the trust of many us and we ask them to reconsider their decisions and restart. There is no shame in going back and redoing what has already been done. I don't see any other way for the mods to regain our trust.

Take a deep breathe and lets give it another try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is not a loophole but a recognition by the federal government that Native peoples are sovereign peoples living within the borders of the US. They follow our federal laws just like other states but they can make their own local laws. Even under these circumstances Native people populate the US military in greater proportions to their actual population than any other racial group in this country. So I don't see they are getting anything that they don't deserve or are owed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tribes have casinos, do not collect cigarette taxes, have their own justice system not because some state which was built on and around their lands gave them anything. Tribal rights are protected by treaties just like the ones the US has with most of the nations of the world. Understand Native peoples were here before there were states. </TEXT>
