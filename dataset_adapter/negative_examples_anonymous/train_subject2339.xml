<TEXT> The point is not to bring those resources back to the surface of earth, but to leave them in orbit.  A huge cost in space, is just getting things from the surface of earth to orbit.

A great example is water. Water on earth is pretty cheap, you would think what is the point of mining an astroid for water it is so cheap already. The thing is, water is really heavy, and and just taking one gallon of it to space can cost tens of thousands of dollars. So if you could produce water in orbit for say 1000 dollars a gallon. that price would be ridiculous on earth, but in space you would actually be 10 times cheaper than the price of launched water.

Water can be used for tons of stuff, like obvious stuff like supporting humans, but also separating it into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel, fuel cells, oxygen for human, and much more. </TEXT>

The whole point of mining an astroid and making stuff out of it in space is because it is really expensive to launch it off the earth.  the point would not be to bring those resources back to earth, but to refine the materials and use them to build stuff in orbit.

<TEXT> Sorry I did not realize I was talking to a new person lol.  Yea i feel like the problem with continuing sanction on Iran is it has the potential to turn the younger Iranian generation against us where right now they are pretty supportive of western culture.

<TEXT> But what is the point of keeping them in sanctions indefinitely?  

The idea with sanctions is that you are incentivizing them to do something, in this case it was to come to the negotiating table.  Sanctions only work so long as everyone is in on them, and most other nations in the world are willing to make a deal now that Iran is ready.  

I think if you were to attempt to continue to sanction Iran, it would turn out like the Cuban Embargo where pretty much every other nation in the world has normal relations except the US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having illegals certainly won't increase the crime rate! It's a crime to even be here. If you think illegals keep the crime rate down because of all the vigilante-like crime reporting they're doing then I'd love to see that source.

That is exactly what I am saying.  There have been many recent studies showing that immigrant communities actually have significantly lower crime rates than other comparable communities.

* http://www.livescience.com/4872-immigration-reduces-crime-rates.html
* http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charis_Kubrin/publication/227690045_THE_POWER_OF_PLACE_Immigrant_Communities_and_Adolescent_Violence/links/00b4952bd08cf4ae70000000.pdf

In the US there is the ongoing misconception that just because someone decided to move travel from one piece of land to another, they are suddenly dangerous criminals.  Merely stepping form [one side of an invisible line to another](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1432/5101130350_5889fd728d_b.jpg) makes you a dangerous criminal. We make the laws and just because it is a law does not mean that it is justified or equal to other laws.  Imagine if we made it illegal for the people living in South Carolina to go to North Carolina.  People would still do it, does that make them the same as murderers?  I would say no, and statistics would say the same thing.  

Ps: One thing that I found especially interesting about those studies is that the statistics seem to show that it is actually 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants that tend to commit more crime, not the 1st generation. So if you are part of a latino gang or something like that, it is very likely that you are actually an american citizen.

<TEXT> I think you mean 1 million total.  I think that we should redesign the way we do immigration in the US.  The problem with our immigration system is we allow the same number of immigrants from every country in the world.  So we allow the same amount of immigrants from Iceland as we do from China.  I think a simple fix that would help would be to make it based on population so larger countries get more Visas, and smaller ones get less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If whitey came over from Europe, do you think they would show up with less than an 8th grade education?

But then again "whitey" from Europe would probably not be willing to pick lettuce 12 hours a day for 4 dollars an hour.  People do not realize that our economy and many businesses benefit enormously from having illegal immigrants working here providing incredibly cheap labor.  

How many people should be able to come into the US?

I think that immigrants from latin america should be treated similarly to immigrants from other countries.  I do not know how many should be allowed to come to the US, but I definitely think it should be more than what we are allowing now.  

I have personally experienced the impunity of our immigration system.   I have a friend from Mexico that was trying to get a tourist visa so she could come to the US and visit.  But because her visa was denied. If she had been from Canada she would be here, but for the sole reason that she was born in Mexico suddenly she is treated like a criminal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city

Here is a source I can find more if you would like.  If you look you will see every major city in the US is on that list of cities that have this policy.  I was slightly mistaken, the police have a policy of not inquiring into your legal status when they are patrolling and such, it seems that once you are arrested the policy is still to turn you over to immigration.

In what world do you live in that you want people illegally invading our country?

Can we keep the personal attacks to a minimum.  Stop putting words in my mouth.  I said nothing about allowing illegal immigrants to invade our country.  Where did you think that I said that?  What I did say is that i support this policy that cities have.  I would rather my city cut its murder and violent crime rate in half than have the police focus on finding illegal immigrants that are minding their own business and not committing crime.  The illegal immigrant in San Francisco was a mistake, and by no means the norm.  Like I said the policy does not prevent you from being arrested and charged with a crime its not a get out of jail free card, it is just a policy that police will not inquire into your legal status if they are responding to your report of a crime or find you walking down the street. 

I would like to ask you now what makes people from Latin America so horrible?  We get immigrants from all over the world, illegal and legal, what makes Latino's so horrible? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I said immigrants are coming here no matter what, you can't seal off a country it is impossible to do.  You forget that more people coming into the US legally will mean more money being spent more tax revenues, and more revenues for businesses which, you guessed it, means businesses can hire more people.

I think the core of what I was saying above, is not about letting any body and their friend come into the US, but opening up the system so that the people that already come here can do so legally.  Businesses make a ton of money by being able to hire workers for very low rates, and not pay taxes on that labor.  If those workers started making more money, it could mean more money being spent at local businesses and more money being spent in general, because low income people spend way more of their income than rich people do.

I think you also need to ask yourself if we were getting big influx of people of people from countries like the UK, France, and Germany and western Europe to work here in the US would you care as much?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a feeling this was not an accident by the Republicans.  They seem to have been doing this more and more lately, where behind closed doors they agree on a way where they can vote one way and get the opposite.  Nobody in their constituency cares about how they voted 6 months ago.  But when they all vote no and Obama overrides them, they can call Obama a dictator monarch president and talk about how he is taking over america and trying to ruin the country.

It seems like even Fox should be able to ask the simple question of if you really did not want this Iran deal, why did you vote for a bill that you fully knew would allow an Iran deal to happen.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok while conservatives have spun the city sanctuary thing as some liberal scandal, it is actually common practice for most large cities, and it makes a lot of sense.

The whole reasoning behind local authorities officially not turning over illegal immigrants to immigration is to fight crime.  Cities were having huge problems with crime because illegal immigrants were afraid to call the cops when crime was happening for the rightful fear that they would be deported.  So most cities began making it official that they would not turn over illegal immigrants to immigration in order to incentivize them to repot crimes.  For the most part it has proven to be very successful with large drops in crime.   

What these laws/policies do not do, and what conservative media fails to mention, is they do not protect criminals.  If the police find that you are a criminal they will arrest you, and if you are an illegal immigrant they will turn you over to immigration.

<TEXT> First of all we do not allow "endless, unchecked, unregulated immigration"  Compared to many other countries our laws are actually quite strict.  What is quite obvious though is that even with these laws people are still coming here because of the economic opportunities available.  When you can make 10 times as much doing the same work you would do back in your home country it makes a lot of sense to come to the US.

Opening up our immigration system would help a great deal, because we could make a lot more of the immigrants who are going to come in anyway, legal immigrants.  This would allow us to 

* tax them properly, 
* prevent them from undercutting wages in the market
* make it easier to track criminals

Those were just the things I could think of off the top of my head.

<TEXT> Is NH simply taking pictures/doing a little science before spending the last of its days hurdling towards interstellar space?

Pretty much. 

If New horizons wanted to enter into orbit around Pluto, it would have had to go on a much larger rocket, likely go much slower, and would have had to carry much more fuel.

This is not really that unusual, I believe most if not all of our other first times visiting planets were flyby missions. In fact Voyager 2 is the only probe we have sent to Uranus or Neptune.  It did a flyby of those two planets in 1985 and 1989 respectively as well as Jupiter and Saturn, and is now flying into deep space.

In general For the purposes of first time encounters, especially to a planet this far away, a flyby mission makes a lot more sense, mainly because it is 

* Faster, it takes much less time to get somewhere when you don't have to slow down.  
* Simplicity, you do not need to know that much about another place to just flyby it, whereas entering into orbit requires you to have a much better understanding of the system you are trying to enter into orbit around,  A great example is until only a few months ago we did not know about Pluto's 3 other moons.  If this is your first time going to a place, you probably do not know what instruments to take either.  It would be a shame to spend a whole bunch of money to take a bunch of optical instruments to Venus when all you are going to get is some pictures of clouds.  If you are going there you probably want to use radar and such so you can see the surface below the clouds.

* Finally cost.  All of these things add up to a much lower cost, for the mission and a much easier sell to the higher ups paying for your mission, which makes sense when you have no idea what you are going to see when you get there.

Make no mistake though, we are going to get a ton of science from this mission.  In the AMA today The scientists talked about how it is going to take [16 months to download it all](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3d9luh/were_scientists_on_the_nasa_new_horizons_team/ct3272a?context=3). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you mean .2 mph/h (miles per hour/per hour) this is because acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity.  MPH is a measure of velocity.  If you need more clarification on that, just ask.  

To your main question.  I am not sure if it is .2 MPH/H but New Horizons is decelerating.  The reason New horizons is slowing down, is because of the Suns gravity.  As New Horizons moves away from the Sun, it slows down, for the same reason that when you throw a ball strait up in the air it slows down.  The main difference is that New Horizons is moving fast enough that it will never fall back to the Sun it will just slow down over time.

Does that make sense? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was reading about the Atlas V recently and realized that in a few of its configurations it only has 1 solid rocket booster.  One of those configurations has been launched 3 times.

The configuration can be really well seen in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dME5amgp0Ug

My question is how is the vehicle able to deal with the loading, because it is quite obvious the rocket seems to be flying slightly sideways to compensate for the off center thrust.

How is the rocket able to fly like this?  It's so odd to see a non symmetrical rocket design.  </TEXT>

Imagine if this town is small enough where it only has one super market, or one mechanic.  What happens when you need to buy food or get your car repaired and they refuse your business for religious reasons.  In many rural areas this is not that much of a stretch.

<TEXT> There is a difference between punishing them, and handicapping them.  How would you feel if for every person we sent to jail we cut off a their foot.  The worse the crime the more you loose, so shoplifting it a toe, grand theft auto is your foot, and murder is leg below the knee.  If you proposed this people would say this is horrible.  People would be unable to care for themselves once they leave prison.  What people do not recognize is this is what we already do this to people mentally.  When you treat a person like an animal and don't give them the chance to better themselves, than they are going to turn into an animal.  Are prisons these days are the breeding ground for even worse criminals, and even if you do get out we make life so hard for you once you get out that it is likely that you will be forced to return soon.  We are basically cutting their leg off as "punishment" and then blame then when they can't contribute to society when they get out of prison.  So we should ask ourselves is it worth it to "punish" these people with the enormous amount it costs us both monetary and soacially to everyone else. </TEXT>

This article by Slate that explores the Facebook Freebooting problem. They asked me for quotes. I tried to be fair. They quoted me a bit strong, which makes me feel a tad strange.... Like Wyatt Earp trying to clean up the bad guys or something. I'm not Wyatt Earp. I'm just a dude learning stuff on the Internet.
Also, it's kind of funny that I'm sharing this via Facebook. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I somehow did a hard reset on my nook a few weeks ago, It was not a big deal as with most of my books I have the .epub's on my computer. But when i turned it on it would not work unless I typed in my B N login.

How do I keep this from happening in the future?

Is there open source software for the Nook that I could install?

I don't want to get trapped in this situation again. This time i was able to recover my password from B N.com, but in the future i have a feeling B N might not be there. </TEXT>

In fact Ted Cruz even voiced support for his comment about Mexican rapists.  So far it looks like this is going more the way of Tod Akin and the "Women have a way to shut that down".  People are seeing Trump as emblematic of Republicans, not the crazy outlier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No they run a very efficient propaganda campaign online where they basically convince young people that they can come make a difference in the world by joining ISIS. That they can make the world a better place where the ideals of islam are followed crap like that.  They sell themselves as the the oppressed that are defending the true ideals of Islam.  

This is why you hear about so many of these kids that go to Syria and join ISIS and then a couple months later they want to come home.  Basically they were brainwashed by ISIS into thinking that ISIS was a good cause, and when they get there they start to see that the stuff they are doing is pretty horrible.

<TEXT> Yea but you have to look at why people are breaking the law.  By coming to the US they can make 10 times as much doing the exact same job.  

You also have to question why we are so resistant to immigration from Latin America.  We seem to have no problem with people coming from Europe, but when they come from Mexico suddenly they are a danger to our country and leaching off our taxes and welfare.  

In reality immigrants like those from Latin America pay an enormous amount of taxes even if they are illegal, because they spend almost 100% of what they earn. 

When looking at this issue you should consider that Illegal immigrants would not be coming to the US if there were not job opportunities here.  The companies are breaking the law by hiring illegal immigrants.  If people wanted to truly stop illiegal immigration they would target these companies not the people that are just taking advantage of the opportunities available to them. </TEXT>

So if you were to accidentally bump the button, it would put you in a sudden turn and when you tried to correct you it would feel like somebody was in the other seat working against you.  My instructor showed me where it was just in case and suggested i not use it.  

The point is there are not as many autopilot planes as you think, and even if you are i one and know how to use it.  That does not fix the spacial disorientation problem.  When you enter IMC and program in the turn, it is likely it will feel like the autopilot is doing the wrong thing the feeling is likely to be so compelling that you may switch off the autopilot thinking that it is broken. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ground school can be good if thats the way you learn.  I would suggest waiting on ground school though, you don't need ground school to start flight lessons.  I would suggest buying a textbook and reading it.  It will teach you a lot of the stuff that you need to know about flying.  After that decide if you still feel like you need ground school. 

For a good textbook I would suggest the "[Jeppesen Private Pilot Manual](http://www.mypilotstore.com/MyPilotStore/sep/1941?gclid=CjwKEAjwq-OsBRDd95aryprR9wQSJACQnU3G0_g1hIS09r0XCLhoNmeKJErvy2EXaHVnNM0Qcpui-RoCzfbw_wcB)".  That is the one I used and I really liked it. There were lots of diagrams and pictures, and it was easy to understand.

As for the Wings of Carolina Flying Club, I have not found rates any better anywhere else I have looked.  I probably would have joined by now, but I don't fly enough for the $65 monthly membership rate to be cost effective.  But it is totally worth it to take lessons there.  Their instructor rates are half of anywhere else I have seen, and because you tend to fly more while taking lessons it would come out cheaper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did flyover Fayetteville and Fort Bragg one time but i am not very familiar with flying opportunities down there.  The closest club I know about is [Wings of Carolina Flying Club](http://wingsofcarolina.org/) They have [really good rates](http://wingsofcarolina.org/aircraft) on their airplanes and their instructors, but that is pretty far north for you.  You need to do the math and see if it is worth it to make the trip.

Just form some simple googling I was able to find a couple flight schools in Fayetteville. 

* http://www.dillonsaviation.com/
* http://aaavn.com/pricing/

Those are just a couple, there are a ton more.  

Just google, and also look for local airports around you almost every airport including the tiny ones have a flying school.  A lot of times it is good just to go to the airport FBO and ask about flying schools.  Shop around if you feel like you are getting a bad deal, go to a different place, it is also important that you feel comfortable with your instructor. 

Also as for flying as a hobby, that is fine, but it is a very expensive hobby.  You just need to make sure you can keep up with the costs.  If you want to go flying once a month for 2 hours you could easily be spending $200 or more.

   Expect to spend 8000 or more on training to get your Private.  If you can afford it, training faster(2,3 or more lessons a week) is cheaper in the long run because you waste less time reviewing.  Once you have your Private things get a little cheaper as well, because you don't need to pay for an instructor and so on.

I hope this all helped.

My best suggestion is to shop around take lots of notes on prices and figure out what is best for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should go to a flight school and talk to a flight instructor.  A lot of these questions are super simple to answer.

As for your questions 

1.  You are charged for when the engine is running not how much time the plane is in your possession.  So if you fly for 2 hours spend the night and fly 2 hours back you will pay for a total of 4 hours.  Depending on where you rent from, it is common to have minimum daily hours if you are going to have the plane for more than a day.  So the minimum daily hours might be 4 hours meaning for every day you have the plane you get charged for 4 hours whether you flew 4 hours or not.  

2. This is basic stuff you learn in your first few lessons.  basically when flying into most uncontrolled airports there is nothing you need to do ahead of time.  Most airports are uncontrolled meaning there is no control tower telling you which way to go.  you report over the radio where you are in relation to the airport and talk to other planes in the pattern in order to maintain safe spacing and so on.

3. A typical renting situation is renting an airplane for a wet hourly rate meaning fuel is included.  For a 4 seater Cessna 172. this can range for anything from $110 an hour to $165 an hour.  This is why it is important to shop around and find the best prices.  This will be your main cost.  If you plan to spend the night at a different airport then it is typical to pay small tie down fee(Most people don't put their plane in a hangar for an overnight stay), all though it is common for this to be waived if you buy fuel (which is paid for by your hourly rate anyway).  The only place you really see landing fees are at big airports like Charlotte or Raleigh most private pilots don't usually go into these airports though unless they are based there.

I also fly in NC if you want, you can PM me or comment a more specific location and I might be able to suggest some flight schools. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The funny thing is Latinos tend to be very socially conservative, but the Republicans just keep shooting themselves in the foot with things like self deportation, and now Donald Trump.   

Notice that more than one Republican frontrunner is there to court Latinos.  Jeb Bush's wife is Mexican, and he speaks Spanish fluently.  Marco Rubio is latino and also speaks Spanish.   Notice that the republicans have also been trying to mov away from their previous stance on immigration.  They are trying to court the Latino voting block without loosing their base.  I feel like that is why they like Jeb so much.  With him they can have it both ways.  He is a standard white conservative that the Republican base will vote for, but he also is very appealing to the Latino population because he is so in tune with them and their culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are multiple reasons why this wouldn't work, that have been addressed in other threads.

1. The first is the legs, they are not strong enough to support the whole rocket.  Just having an empty second stage, and Dragon on top would add a significant amount of weight to the craft.  

2. You would not be able to get fuel out of stage 2 further exacerbating problem 1 as well as problem 3 and 4.

3. Now we get into control problems.  When flying through the atmosphere on a rocket, you want the heavy end going first, followed by the light end for stability purposes (this is not that un-similar from a dart or arrow.).  When the rocket launches the top is the heavy end.  When the first stage is flying in for landing the bottom where the engines are is the heavy end.  By keeping the top on the rocket you mess all this up, now the top is heavy, but you are flying engines first.  This setup is unstable, and most likely will lead to the aerodynamic forces flipping the rocket around.  
4.  Similar to the first problem the grid-fins, which are normally located all the way at the top of the first stage would now be a third of the way down the rocket rendering them ineffective.  What makes the grid-fins so effective, is the long arm to the center of gravity(basically they are about as far away from the center of gravity as possible, like the tail on an arrow.).  Having the top on the rocket puts the grid-fins very close to the Center of mass rendering them useless.  This would make targeting anything as small as a landing platform impossible.


In perfect conditions, and with some retrofitting, like strengthening the legs, moving the grid-fins to the dragon trunk and adding a way to vent/transfer fuel to stage 1 from stage 2, you might be able to do it.  but now what you have done is designed a new rocket that is capable of this RTLS abort.  This seems like it may be reasonable until you think about how many circumstances this may actually be used. There are virtually none, because if Falcon is functioning well enough to do this maneuver, it is probably capable of getting to orbit.  This maneuver is much harder than just getting to orbit.  

So if things were going south and you want to cut your losses, aborting the Dragon capsule, bringing the 1st stage in for landing, and just accepting the loss of the second stage, seems much more reasonable and has a much better chance of working than attempting a full stack landing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically anything where the rocket is still flying but has left its planned course.  Great examples of times when self destruct would probably be employed is the 

* [Proton mishap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjNNX2sLIro)
* [Early launches of China's Long March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBJ9ue6GKek) - This one actually killed hundreds of people in a nearby town.


In both of these self destruct was not employed, and you can see how much damage and how dangerous the rocket is capable of.

This is where new ones are posted.  The only way to find out where the chain goes is to dive on in.  (or google for cheaters)  

I started following a link a few weeks ago i stop and bookmark the page and pick it up again later.  I am only 4 months back so far.  A friend tells me that is speeds up the farther back you go though.

<TEXT> I think that this might be getting blown out of proportion.  A lot of times you can make something sound bad when it really isn't.  If NASA signed off on this fix, I am tempted to believe they thought it was a reasonable way to fix the problem.  

Here is an example of another way you could write this.  

* Insider says that cracks in the tank liner came up occasionally.  They would fix problem by applying a layer of teflon to the area in order to prevent cracks from spreading.

When you word it like that it sounds a lot less like shoddy workmanship and a lot more like legitimate repair practice.  

Even if they were doing this we don't now that this was the cause.  Elon said that it was an over pressurization event.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I understand what you are saying.  I think the reason people see hubris as a dangerous trait is that being overly confident can put you into dangerous situations. Someone who does not want to admit that they are in over their head is dangerous, but i would say someone who does not realize they are in over their head is even more dangerous.  It is also because even the best pilot in the world our still susceptible to the mechanical failures and limitations of the airplane.  I think people say that over confidence is a dangerous attitude because often times it comes with cockiness and the "nothing can hurt me" mentality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Plenty of pilots who are not celebs are naturally gifted at everything, I feel the need to brag that I passed my PPL in one hobs unit past minimum... one and only that one because of some stupid twat in circuit delaying me! Yes, I was the smug star pupil, and I loved it.

Just giving you a tip, bragging about how you got your PPL right at 40 hour is a pretty stupid thing to brag about.  Nobody will think that you are a better pilot for saying so, and the fact that you are bragging about it will only reflect badly on you and your judgment.  

Getting your PPL close to 40 hours is more luck than anything, and training more than 2-3 times a week.  Many people just don't have the time and money to train at that pace.  The fact that you blame "some stupid twat in circuit" for you not getting in at exactly 40 hours further reflects badly upon you as a pilot.

Just wondering where did you get your training? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This article seems to ignore basic facts, Like when you pollute a river, nobody lives near it, and the land is essentially worthless so nobody is going to bother spending money to defend it.  

It also ignores common resources that are impossible to regulate with a pure market, like the air, or oceans.  I think anti government conservatives and libertarians who think the world would be a Utopia without government regulation, should go to Mexico.

I love Mexico, but they have serious problems with water quality and air quality.  In many cases this is due to there being much less regulation.  In many places raw sewage goes directly in to rivers and streams, along with industrial chemicals from factories.  If you are within 100 feet of the river you can smell it.  In the US we Used to do this exact same thing, in fact there are even some crazy stories about [Rivers catching on fire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Cuyahoga_River#Environmental_concerns)  But around the 70s and 80s we decided that it was time to start taking care of our country.  We created things like the EPA in order to regulate things that are damaging to the environment in order to make the US a better place to live.

Here is another example with the air.  Do you like to exercise outside going on bike rides and runs though your city?  I do too, and when i did it in a city in Mexico my lungs would usually start to develop a burning sensation by the time I was done exercising.   But what is a little burning?  Exercise hurts a little right?  Well after doing that for a couple months in a city in Mexico, I started to developed a cough that would not go away.  It was almost like a smokers cough.  

Long story short.  I get back to the US where we have stricter regulations in order to protect air quality.  What do you know after a week or two with some good air those problems just magically went away.  

Most conservatives seem to want it both ways they love that they can swim in rivers and lakes and breath fresh air, but then they want to get rid of the very organizations that have made those things possible.

PS: I just want to say I love Mexico! it is a great place and they are improving so much.  But it is still a good case study to see what a place is actually like when there is less government regulation to protect common resources.

Edit:  My first Gold :)  Thank you kind stranger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ah ye of little faith.  

There are tons of ways that she could get to Westeros.  In fact I think GRRM has been laying the groundwork to get her there.  GRRM Dropped a whole fleet of ships right at her doorstep with the iron islanders.  He is now giving her a means to beat the iron islanders with the new Kahl.  all she has to do is gain control of the Dothraki.  My bet is she is going to go back to the womb of the world convince all of the Dothraki to follow her in the biggest Kahl ever and then lead them to Maureen.  Or something along those lines.

She has also had problems controlling her Dragons.  But GRRM just added the plot device of the Giant dragon controlling horn.  The one problem is it kills whoever uses it by burning them.  But We have already been shown on multiple occasions that Danerys can not be burned, so when she uses it, it may give her control of her dragons without killing her.

Also GRRM has brought together quite a few major characters in Maureen.  it makes sense that he has brought them together so they can depart with Danerys.  Almost all the major characters in the area have come together at Mareen.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have an old 2 channel fighterbird from a long time ago.  

http://www.hobbyzonerc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=HBZ4000

I am trying to convert it from a 2 channel to a 4 channel.  I think the only things that i am really going to save are the motor and the fuselage.  The electronics are just too old.  My question is what kind of esc should i use with the motor it has.  I am pretty sure it is a brushed motor.  It looks almost exactly like [this one](http://secure.hobbyzone.com/search/hcag1055.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwqe-rBRCv_J6qs6isp6EBEiQAmbctFvBjGdlD69sZoG2TEcgYfqfWj6G93EO6dwa5Rk4JyqcaApkF8P8HAQ).

The problem is i can not find any statistics on this motor.  I would like to figure out what the amps and voltage requriements are so i can buy an appropriate ESC and battery.  

Can anyone help me out?

I feel like this could be a fun project, I just need some help figuring this out so that i can move on to the other parts of the airplane. </TEXT>

<TITLE> When can we expect the imagery to be updated? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I remember hearing a while back about a possible deal to get the imagery updated for OSM.  I was wondering when can we expect it to be updated?  in some places it is getting as much as 4-5 years old which is a big problem because It makes mapping new features exceedingly hard.  

I am just wondering how long is the time between imagery updates typically? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea someone mentioned that it might have been slightly purposeful.  They compared the bending in LOK to boxing, which makes sense with it being a similar time period to the 1920s.  It's still boring though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree although frame by frame the quality was higher, I feel like they were much less imaginative blocking out the scenes and with their camera angles.  I also really missed the choreography of the ALTA fights.  I feel like LOK often involves the characters just using their bending to throw things at each other.  A great comparison is the [Toph, Aang, and Azula fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdcdhgn0zHM) vs the [Kuvira and Korra Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqYY17r1UjQ).  For me the the Korra Fight is just plain boring visually compared to the ALTA.  They are standing in pretty much in the same place and just hurling things at each other.  

This is just one example there are plenty of others in Korra where they are just throwing things and ALTA ones where there is excellent choreography and it it is really fun to watch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically if the pages were to prove this, it would show that the Bush administration basically cherry picked the data they wanted so that they could get public support behind attacking the countries that they wanted to.  Politically Saudi Arabia has been a relatively good ally in the region.  

The motive would be they did not want to attack a country that was an "ally" and also pretty well armed.  They preferred to focus on countries that were not friendly to the US and would be relatively easy to invade.  Like Iraq and Afghanistan.  Notice they did not invade Iran, because that country would have been able to defend it self much better, even though Iran was much more of a threat by the "Axis of Evil" standards than Iraq was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It tries to prevent people from rating out agriculture companies when the people leak about bad practices going on.  

There are many ways to go about doing it, in some states they have made it illegal to lie about your intentions when getting a job.  I believe this particular one makes it possible to sue the employee for damages which is just ridiculous.  It would be like If the car companies had quality control issues and started passing laws saying they could sue an employee for lost sales if they go to the media about the quality control issues.  The only difference is this is our food which makes it even more scary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow over the last day we have almost doubled the amount of subscribers to /r/New_Horizons. I want to say welcome to everyone new, I know everyone is looking forward to seeing awesome pictures of Pluto in July.

As a quick memo to everyone, updates from New Horizons have been a bit slow lately We expect them to pick up more as New Horizons gets closer to Pluto.  We will post updates, photos, ect as soon as we find them, but sometimes we can go a few days with out any new material.  If you see something interesting don't be afraid to post it. Anyway to the main point of this thread.

This is our second comment thread.  If you have questions, comments, theories, ect post it here. Hopefully we can answer anything you are wondering about.

<TEXT> All those things are exactly what Google Map Maker had in place.  It's not impossible to solve but it would be difficult.  I feel like wikipedia has shown that it can be done though and I feel like OSM should use similar techniques to Wikipedia to solve the problem of vandalism if it starts to become a problem.  

I also feel like one thing that has protected OSM for a while is actually how the learning curve is steep.  Especially for JOSM.  Having multiple editing tools makes it a lot easier to stop vandalism in my opinion.  The ID editor is the easiest to use and would probably attract the most trolls.  If you needed to you could put more restrictions on the easier editors or something like that. </TEXT>

There is a difference between being strong willed, and being disrespectful, and Korra was disrespectful up until she went back to Tenszin in season 2.  I remember one episode that stuck out for me from ATLA was first episode of Book 3 when Aang made a point to be nice to Katara's dad even though Katara was obviously unhappy with her dad.  That made him so much more mature in my eyes than if he had just sat there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea but this is under a very controlled circumstance.  Aborts don't happen when everything is going right.  also the reason it didn't start tumbling was because of the trunk.  In general you want something to be passively controlled in circumstances where you might not be able to be confident in your data or your systems.  People forget that lifting the trunk is not that big of a deal.  The Soyuz lifts a fairing and the habitation module as well as the decent module during its aborts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It tends to fall into 3 major categories.  Almost all of the time it involves removing the clitoris and then depending on the type they may remove other parts.  The less extreme forms would be comparable to cutting off the end of the penis. the most extreme forms would be comparable to removing the whole penis.  Either way circumcision does not affect the mans quality of life in any way close to the way FGM affects a woman.

<TEXT> Circumcision is less controversial though, is generally not detrimental to the mans well being/sexual health and arguably has health benefits like reducing the transmission of HIV/AIDS as well as some other STDs.  FGM is more like cutting off the whole or part of the penis.

Edit: I didn't realize stating facts would be so unpopular.  here is a link talking about how HIV transmission is reduced with circumcised heterosexual males.  http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/

Edit2: Everyone calm down, I am not saying I support circumcision.

Edit3: Defined well being.

Edit4: /u/blank_sunday_stares posted a good link showing no correlation between circumcision and STDs http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19115756 I thought I should put it in my post.  I did say that it was arguable wether it reduces HIV/AIDS transmission.  As always more science could help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Astronomers can do a suprising amount with Earth based observations. For instance they have made accurate estimations of the [mass of Pluto and Charon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#Mass_and_size) by obserbing the orbital periods.  Using [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy) they can also learn things like the composition of the atmosphere.  All of these things are great, but all of them can be improved on greatly through a mission like that of New Horizons.  First of all you can measure things that are not possible to measure with ground based operations, like wether Pluto has a magnetic field.  You ask what is so important about a magnetic field?  Well the properties of a magnetic field can give you a great deal of information about the interior structure of a planet.  One of the biggest things a close up mission like this can do is give you clear pictures of what the body actually looks like.  This gives you a lot of science on its own.  Up until now this [picture taken by Hubble](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Pluto_animiert_200px.gif) is the best one we have had of Pluto.  The flyby wil give us incredibly clear images of the planet that should give us all kinds of information.  Since this is the first Kuiper Belt object we will fly by we don't really know what to expect.  That is part of what makes this mission so amazing, for the first time in decades we are getting ready to fly by an object we know very little about.  It is comparable to the first time we flew by Mars with [Mariner 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_4), the first time we flew by Jupiter [Pioneer 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10), or the first time we flew by Uranus and Neptune with [Voyager 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2). 

TLDR:  There is no substitute for close observations of a planet and with the different instruments on board we should be able to extrapolate a lot not only about Pluto and its past, but about many other Kuiper belt objects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have about 70 hours and I got my PPL about 2 years ago.  Its a bunch of fun.  

My best advice to you as a new pilot is never get complacent.  Be exact and precise and most of all be cautious.  When you start to feel like you have got it all down and start to push the envelope is when it will come and bite you in the butt.  Their are old pilots and their are bold pilots but their are no old bold pilots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think any of the basic three emergency services (police, ambulance, firefighters) really should never ever be denied to someone no matter the fees or insurance or whatever. They're emergency services, surely you can fight about money after the emergency has been dealt with.

Those things are great, but they are not free.  Who would pay for them?  I understand why you think this is messed up, but no one would pay if they could just pay when their house is burning.

The problem you have here is a classic [Tragedy of the Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).  If you were to play the good guy and put out the fire for free, than word would spread and everyone would stop paying their fee.  You may say well maybe they could pay a big fine afterwords for putting out the fire without paying the Fee.  That would not solve the problem for two reasons.  One the Fire Department needs a regular source of income to stay operational.  You might go years without a fire in a rural area like that and without a source of income the fire department would close for lack of funds.  But the very next year you could have 10 fires and nobody to fight them.  The second is I bet many of these people living in these rural areas would not be able to or unwilling to pay the fine which would be huge on the order of a few thousand dollars.  They would say "All they did is spray some water! Why does that cost 10,000 dollars?"

I think the obvious solution here is to change the $75 fee into a tax.  That way everyone pays for something that is beneficial to everyone.  This is precisely why we have taxes, to fund basic things that everyone needs but would not pay for on an individual basis if they were not forced to.  Everything you do everyday is paid for by your taxes roads, schools, bridges, police, and yes Fire departments.  I think this is a perfect glimpse of the kind of things that happen in a country with "small government" and little to no taxes.  Imagine if we lived in a country like that where we let peoples houses burn down because they didn't pay a silly fine.  Imagine if we lived in a country where we let people die because they could not afford health insurance...  ohh wait we do.

Edit: I would honestly like to know how you think we should pay for these public services? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly what is cheaper building a new rocket or cleaning up and fixing an old one.  This is why Elon puts so much emphasis on rapidly reusable.  If you have to refurbish the whole thing before the next launch it gets to be just as or more expensive as new rockets and you have to start to question why you don't just make a new one.  Fingers crossed for good results from landed booster when they go to test it.  Rapid reusability could change everything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: Why can you be fired from a job before you have been convicted of a crime? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-03 23:16:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I read [this story recently](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/crime/colorado-woman-sentenced-lying-police-about-kidnap-and-rape-never-happened) about how a man was falsely accused and because of it lost his job and was not able to find a new one because of the accusations.  This is not the first time I have heard of this happening to people, where they face retribution at work for crimes that they have not been convicted of.

My question is how is it legal to fire someone for a crime they have not been convicted of?  What has happened to innocent until proven guilty?  It is not like this is in the shadows, many companies even have policy of not hiring anybody that has charges pending against them.  It sounds like now even getting accused of a crime is enough for a business to fire you.  They don't even wait to see the results of a trial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was under the impression that Mellisandre was just a temporary POV which we have seen GRRM do a few times in the recent books.  And when I mean central character I mean central to the overall plot of the series.  He has killed off main characters like Catlyn, Robb, Joffrey, Robert, and Ned.  But those characters while central and important, were not the same as Characters like Daenerys and in my opinion Jon Snow.  In my opinion the books are about certain characters more so than others.  I think Daenerys is obviously the main character of the whole series and on the second level I think Jon Snow, Tyrion, Arya, and Bran, are all central characters to the overall plot of the books.  I am not saying that these characters could not die, but I am saying that in my opinion these five characters are much less likely to get killed off than other main and POV characters who are more incidental to the plot of the books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly feel like taking a company public in this day and age is like giving it poison.  It might not kill it in a year or even 10 years, but it seems like companies always begin to go downhill after they go public.  It becomes all about increasing profits and not about the product anymore and it just seems like these days all investors care about is sucking money out of your company, and when it dries up they move on to the next one.  

Although I would love to invest in them, I am super glad that Elon has made the decision to not take SpaceX public.  Investors would turn it into another ULA and completely kill off development in anything that did not show the potential to be profitable within 5-10 years.  It would completely kill what makes SpaceX SpaceX.  I think Elon has even hinted in interviews that he knows that this wold happen if he were to go public.  He just uses more polite language. </TEXT>

You also have to weigh in the fact that Elon is becoming a bit of a star so people will naturally want to hear what he says.  Just having him him do the presenting creates hype around whatever it is he is presenting.  Even if he stammers here or there, the enthusiasm shows through, and it feels genuine.  Personally I thought the Dragon V2 reveal was great, and while the Tesla today wasn't as smooth, it was just as exciting. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is SpaceX not being more creative with their trunk? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-02 06:32:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So in light of the recent events with Progress M-27M there has been a lot of talk around the subreddit about there being more pressure on SpaceX because of the lack of very many alternative cargo vessels.  There have been many questions about why SpaceX can not re-boost the station or carry more supplies and so on. My question is, why does SpaceX not try and utilize it's trunk more on Dragon?  

I feel like there are a lot of possibilities for how the trunk could be used, like a propulsion module for giving the station re-boosts which could be either fired up while still attached to dragon, or removed and attached to a better spot on the station.  Maybe just some fuel tanks that can be used to refuel the Zvezda module, or stored externally on the station until they are needed.  

I also think a pressurized container to go inside the trunk would maybe work.  The Canada Arm could take it out and attach it to a different docking port allowing for the transfer of more materials.  You could even go with a simple unpressurised container that you would take out using the Canada arm and store externally on the station, retrieve on a space walk, and bring in the through the airlock.  This could be stuff like freeze dried food, where it does not really matter if it travels unpressurized.

So why are some of these ideas not viable?  It has been shown that the Falcon 9 can carry more weight and still land the first stage, and with the v1.2 they will have even more available mass.  On more than one occasion the trunk has gone completely empty, which just seems like a waste.  What are the reasons behind not trying to utilize trunk more? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am going to pop the hype bubble a little bit, and ask...

What would change if Bernie Sanders was president?  The Republicans have shown that they can stonewall pretty much anything Obama wants, and Obama is much more center than Bernie.  There were some big campaign promises given by Obama, that congress pretty much shut down, like ending Guantanamo.  

I really want to know, how would Bernie be able to govern more effectively than Obama?  I think he is great, but how is he going to be able to get anything done with congress the way it is? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is also why safety nets and welfare are a good thing.  When a worker knows that he won't starve or loose his stuff he is more likely to quit and try and find a better job.  By giving people the option of welfare they are less likely to put up with the crap from a bad employer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What most people that want to get rid of the minimum wage seem to forget about, is that many people that work for minimum wage are already receiving public assistance.  This basically means businesses are shifting their labor costs onto the government.  So by getting rid of the minimum wage businesses would most certainly pay workers less which is effectively just shifting more of their labor cost onto the government.  

Walmart does this in mass, and the irony is many of those workers turn around and spend their government assistance, like food stamps, at you guessed it, Walmart.  Walmart has pretty much made a business out of being the place to spend your government assistance like food stamps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have started to realize that he kills off all his characters to continue the plot.  Many authors jump through all these hoops to keep everyone alive.  For George R.R. Martin if a characters death is necessary than he does it.  When you go back and look at everyone who has died, you begin to see that many of the deaths had lasting effects for the story line.  One of the largest such deaths was the death of Ned Stark.  Ned's death basically began all the events for the next 4 books.  Kahl Drogo's death set in motion Daenery's story line.  The examples go on and on.   </TEXT>

Then I turned around and thrusted to put my rescue craft back into orbit so it would not get deleted in the atmosphere.  One of my most satisfying moments in KSP.

<TEXT> Well I did not say that it is affordable. I just said that you don't need to to go for all the bells and whistles.  Going to an instate school full time can cost close to 20k a year.  It is really not possible to work your way through school with that kind of price tag.  

You do the math and you figure out the only way you can pay for that is if you have a full time job that pays much more than minimum wage.  I don't know how anyone could hold a full time job while also going to school full time.  

If you think part time is the answer than get ready to be going to school for the next 12 years of your life.  I really doubt that is practical.

Once you figure all that up you realize why so many kids are taking out loans to pay for college.  It is a smart calculation based on opportunity cost. </TEXT>

Its not like news stations call up Sharpton to ask what his plans are for the future of the movement.~~  Think about it if somebody wanted to talk to the head of the movement, who would they talk to.  In my opinion there is not currently a true head of this movement.  The biggest thing that could make a difference to this movement is if they got a leader like MLK was to the civil rights movement in the 60's.  They need a guy that can e the face of their cause and give it a voice and a direction.  So when people think of the movement, they automatically think of that guy.

<TEXT> I also agree I feel like riots happen when frustration reaches a breaking point.  People are can only put up with so much before they say enough is enough.  This is especially true when they feel like conventional means for getting things done are just giving them the run around.  People get tired of the BS.  

Whats too bad is the current movement lacks any real leadership.  This lack of leadership means there is nobody to give the cause a single voice.  This makes the movement disorganized easy to criticize (because there is no representative to defend the movement) and prone to violence and when violence does break out, it comes across as pointless and just people that are looking for an excuse to destroy stuff and steal things, not people mad over social injustice.

<TEXT> There is a difference between being innocent until proven guilty and being above the law.  Innocent until proven guilty means they can't put you in prison until they have proven you guilty of a crime in court.  Investigating and charging someone with a crime does not make them guilty.  The media seems to have a hard time understanding this, that just because you have been arrested does not make you guilty.

I am saying that it is ridiculous that this kind of thing gets swept under the rug and no investigation is launched and no charges are made when it is obvious that there was wrong doing.  A guy getting a broken neck while sitting in jail does not just happen.  If this happened anywhere else it would be considered a murder and investigated as such.  Why does the same not hold true in a jail cell.

Expecting an investigation and calling this a murder is not in contradiction to innocent until proven guilty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am getting into the hobby, I purchased a used quad a few months ago and enjoy flying it, but now i want to do some airplanes as well.  With my quad the KK2 board has an alarm and voltage meter hooked in so when the voltage gets low the alarm starts to ring and i know to land.  My question is how do you keep from under volting your LIPO on an airplane, that does not have a control board?  

I am looking into getting some of these Lemon Rx Receivers http://www.lemon-rx.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product path=59 product_id=92 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have not, I have sailed Lasers, Sunfish, 420s, and FJs.  Slightly larger boats I have sailed have been Flying Scotts and Thistles.  Out of those  I would say Sunfish is my favorite but I am also biased.  If you have sailed 420's or FJ's I would say both the Sunfish and the Laser feel like a faster more agile boat than either of those.  The 420 is like driving a truck, where the Laser and Sunfish are more like go-karts.  I saw somebody suggest going and borrowing or renting them and seeing what they are like.  I think that is a good suggestion.  Again though, make sure they are in good condition otherwise it wont give you he right impression of the boat.

As for the downsides of the two boats, the Laser is tipsy because of its round hull and when sailing especially in heavy wind, you never really get a break.  The Laser is also not that great for carrying more than one person, because the coordination gets hard with the boat being tipsy.  I would say the Sunfish is good on both of these points.  

The Sunfish on the other hand is slightly slower than the laser, and due to the lateen rig can not point quite as high.  Both of these are really only noticeable when you are sailing next to a Laser or maybe if you have gotten used to the characteristics of sailing a laser.

Thats really all I can think to tell you.  You probably all ready know this but when buying a sunfish or a Laser, you should not bother with a boat that has any leaks.  I know in the sunfish the foam on the inside and the fiberglass absorbs the water and really weigh the boat down, even after you have drained it.  The hull on a new sunfish weighs 120 pounds so if you go look and a Sunfish and it weighs a ton than it is not worth buying, a Sunfish should be easy to pick up with two people.

Thats really all I can think of, is the Laser Pico similar to the 420 or the FJ?  What other boats have you sailed maybe I can help give you a compassion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An important thing with getting a sunfish, is making sure you get a good one. You can buy a sunfish for 800 bucks, but it is going to leak be heavy, and sail slow.  I love Sunfish, but i have sailed ones like this and they suck.  Even with good wind they just sit there.  On the other hand a Sunfish in good condition sails great.  They are fast, and even plain on reach in good wind.  Make sure if you get a Sunfish it is in good condition, and i would suggest looking for one with a racing rig as they have some features that make them go faster.  

The main thing is don't get those cheap Sunfish.  They will be a big disappointment, and i would hate to see you get a bad impression of the boat because you got one of those crappy water logged ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The apples to apples comparison is with the sail attached to the spars.  No sunfish sailor ever takes the sail off the spars you put the spars and the mast together and roll the sail, and then the whole thing goes into the bag.  That is how everyone does it.  Sunfish sailors are taking perfectly good care of their sails.  Your example of wrapping the sail around the mast would be comparable to leaving rig and sail on the boat and just putting the sail beneath the boat cover.

With lasers it makes more sense to take the sail off the mast because it just slips off the top. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have never sailed a Sunfish before, the sail is attached to the spars with either plastic clips, or small ties.  Anybody i have ever met just puts the spars together and rolled up the sail.  It would be pretty silly to take the sail off the spar every time you de-rigged.  It would take at least an hour, and then you would have to reattach it again the next time which would take another hour.  Because you would have to go through and undo every one of those ties/clips.  There really is no downside to leaving the sail attached either, if you roll the sail right, it should not be detrimental to the sail.  you do not wrap the sail around the spars, you roll it up next to the spars, so there is really no wrinkles or pressure points on the sail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like there are a lot of people that like lasers on here.  I am a fan of Sunfish, I have sailed both, and it is true that lasers are fast.  What I like about sunfish though is they are not so much work to sail.  The more square hull makes them much more stable than a laser and not so much of a work out.  Also in my opinion the Sunfish is a tougher boat than the Laser.  The Laser is all about speed, and because of that the hull is thinner, and also rounded.  I have had collisions while racing Sunfish that probably would have punched a hole in a Laser,  I can't even find a ding on the gelcoat on my sunfish afterwords.  As to speed, the sunfish is not slow in my opinion, but it is slower than a Laser.  

To sum things up if you like speed and are looking for a sports car the Laser is probably better.  If you are looking for a more laid back fun boat that is easier to rig, more about sailing, and less about fine tuning everything, the Sunfish might be better.  That laid back atmosphere continues to the people who sail them.  Some of the nicest sailers i have met have been other sunfish sailers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you referring to MH370 and German Wings as the two crashes caused by pilots?  There is no proof right now that MH370 was caused by the pilots.  Second I think especially in the case of German Wings, the problem was procedure.  In the US there are always 2 people in the cockpit.  This is for safety reasons when opening the door.  The pilot is supposed to check to see that is the pilot asking to be let in, but if he is the only one in the cockpit how can he without leaving nobody at the controls. You can never fully screen out crazy people from the system, that is why smart procedures are important.  In many crashes it is very simple to just blame the pilots even when there is evidence that it was not the pilots fault. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_811#Personal_investigation,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_rudder_issues This is a list of incidents caused by faulty valves for the rudder causing the rudder to go hard over.

Many of these crashes were originally blamed on the pilots, including a few that were blamed on pilot suicide.

I am not saying German Wings was caused by the pilots, but often times it is much easier and there is a financial incentive for the investigation to find the pilots at fault. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maintenance does not have to erase the recorder, there is a button in the cockpit that you push.  If you push and hold the button for two seconds, provided the plane is on the ground and the parking break is engaged, it will erase the flight voice recorder, but not the data recorder.  

I could be a little out of date now, but from what i understand this feature was hard fought by unions when voice recorders were being introduced.  The unions wanted to make sure the voice recorders would only be used in crash investigation, and not be used by management to police pilot performance.  So if you are parked at the gate after the flight you can erase the voice recorder.

You wanted a source, This is where I remember first reading about the ability to erase the voice recorder after a flight, but I have heard it from other airline pilots as well.
At one station, two women are assembling control panels for cockpit voice recorders. Theres the erase button, says John Kerwin, vice president of operations. Ive never met a pilot yet who believes it works, but it does. And that illuminates one major problem with the idea of streaming data from aircraft in flight, at least as it pertains to cockpit audio: the near certainty that pilots will never stand for it. By law, cockpit voice recordings may be accessed only by investigators after an accident. When a flight arrives safely at the gate, the pilot hits the erase button. (It wont work in flight or during taxiing.) In the event of an accident, transcripts may be released as part of a report but not, as a rule, the actual recording. This is partly a matter of professional pride, partly to spare the feelings of pilots families if they are killed. But primarily it seems to be a labor-management issue. The Air Line Pilots Association, the aviators union, mobilized last year to fight a bill that would allow airlines to use voice and data recorders to evaluate the performance of cockpit crews

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw a post over at /r/MH370 talking about how they were disappointed that even if the plane was found and black boxes recovered, it was likely that the voice recorder would not say much because it will have most likely looped over.  My question is why is the loop on the voice recorder so short?  Wouldn't it make sense to have the loop be 10 or maybe even 20 hours so that it is impossible for it too over write during a normal flight?  

It just seems like this has happened a few times where the voice recorder has over written and it makes it a lot harder to understand what happened.  

It also seems like storage space should not be an issue, new micro SD cards are as large as 120 GB so even with special designing to make the hard drive crash resistant, it seems like it should not be that hard to get a hard drive that has enough space for a few hours of audio recording.

<TEXT> Well now we pretty much know exactly what happened to Air France 447 because we have recovered the plane and its black boxes.  

Before we actually found the plane we had a basic idea.  We knew that the weather had been kind of stormy and that in the events leading up to the crash the plane had sent automated messages saying there were certain problems onboard like the pitot tubes(the sensors that say your airspeed) were not functioning properly.  So the best guess was somehow the stormy weather had brought down the plane.  We also found debris on the ocean confirming that it had crashed.    

After finding the plane and recovering the black boxes a much more complete picture was created revealing that the storm had caused the pitot tubes to freeze over causing erroneous airspeed readings and causing the plane to send the automated messages.  that was just the seed of the crash.  The events that actually caused the crash stemmed off of that and were much more complicated.  Most of the reasons for the crash were the pilots being confused about what the planes instruments were actually telling them and what the plane was actually doing (the plane never said airspeed reading bad it just gave them erroneous readings) bad design of the cockpit(the joysticks for the two pilots in an airbus plane can move in two different directions at the same time unlike almost every other aircraft made.  During the crash one pilot was holding back the his joystick which was overriding the imputes from the other pilot the pilots did not realize this was happening for a long time, and only added to their confusion.) and many more factors

<TEXT> This might be silly, but why are airplane propellers not designed like boat ones.  Boat propellers have a nylon ring on the inside so that when your prop hits something the nylon breaks, breaking the connection between the prop and the motor preventing it from ruining your engine.  All you have to do then is go buy a new prop.  

Edit: Didn't think about all the things that might hit your propeller besides a runway. lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Besides the tons of errors about flying(No you don't lay the hammer down going through a storm, quite the opposite), it perpetuates the fictitious belief that pilots are a bunch of unprofessional hotshots.  The kind of behavior that Denzel showed in the movie (sleeping while flying, drunk, doing drugs) would not make it anywhere in the airlines.  That kind of stuff is taken seriously if the other pilot can smell alcohol on you or suspects that you are drunk they can and are expected to report it immediately.  

Pilots are professionals and you don't get to that level in aviation without being skilled, professional and a little luck.  It is extremely hard and only the best make it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is such a stupid design by airbus.  This could not happen on practically any other airplane because when you move one control column the other one moves with it. So there can never be any confusion about what the inputs are.  Besides the freezing of the peto tubes I think this dangerous design was what propagated the confusion and caused the crash of Air France.  

They blame the pilots for not understanding the situation, but imagine how confusing it is for everything to be going haywire, and on top of that the inputs you think you are giving the plane are not actually what the plane is receiving.  It pisses me off that they just swept that under the rug. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They might be but I doubt it.  You also have to remember that the heating that the booster is experiencing is quite low, it does not even need a heat shield compared to the heats that the engines experience during a burn, the heat from reentry is much less significant.  

The reason the heat is so much lower is because the rocket is moving much more slowly than a vehicle entering from orbit.

Most of the stresses the booster experiences on its way to a landing are actually aerodynamic stresses not thermal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is not that hard to do it correctly.  A perfect example is the Saturn 5 compared to an atlas rocket, or even more extreme the Saturn 5 compared to a rocket the size of the Falcon 1.  The Falcon 1 would be way more inefficient launching the same amount of mass than one large Saturn 5.  And yes the things you mentioned above do make it harder but certainly not anywhere close to impossible the Saturn 5 is an example of that.  

When I say do it correctly I am referring to to rockets like the Soviet moon rocket that was poorly designed and because of this lost the advantages from it being larger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think part of the reason he was able to make the trip without getting killed was because of the gyrocopter he was flying.  Wether he planned it that way, or it was just luck, by using the gyrocopter(which is very small), and flying it very low and slow he was able to avoid a lot of the safety features that are used in that area.  

If he had been in a normal small plane, he would have been picked up on radar, and he would have been intercepted, it has happened many times mostly from people accidentally entering restricted airspace by accident.  Jets would have come and intercepted him warned him to change course and follow instructions, and if he had continued they would have shot him down.

Air traffic control even said that they saw him, but because his gyrocopter was so small and moving so slow they thought it was a flock of geese.

So this brings up the final point while we could probably spend billions more dollars and get a radar system in the DC area that can pick up insects.  The question is why do we need to?  A gyrocopter this small is barely capable of carrying any weight, and even if he had had malicious intent and flown it into the capital it probably would have done barely any damage to the building.  You can see [this crash of a much larger small plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Tampa_airplane_crash) barely did any damage to the building.  

So yea it does not look great that this guy  managed to fly his gyrocopter to the capital but considering that the risk he posed to the public was minimal I don't think that we should be going and spending even more money trying to lock down the DC are even more than it already is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand what you are talking about, but that is only if you use the auto pilot.  Mechjeb is not just about auto pilot though.  Mechjeb gives you a ton of data like DeltaV, thrust to weight ratio, exactly how many seconds more of fuel you have, and a lot more, and you can break the data down by stage so when you are building your rocket you can see if your stages have the appropriate thrust  and such.  Thats the kind of stuff I use Mech Jeb for anyway, I think I have only done an auto launch once or twice because I wanted to see if Mechjeb would actually do it. </TEXT>

Weather or not these stresses would affect the life of the engine is also unknown.

The second was [CRS-6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhMSzC1crr0) that happened just a few days ago.  There was supposed to be a try back in Febuary, on the [DSCOVR Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHJSIKP0Hg) but due to heavy seas the [Drone Ship was Disabled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKhwGOVGWUs). SpaceX instead just did a soft water landing on where the drone ship was supposed to be if it had not been disabled.  Elon said that the booster landed within 10m of where it was supposed to. I think that might be where your confusion came from about the booster missing the drone ship, but in reality they were not trying to land on the drone ship, because it had been damaged.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok I will address your points. Starting with your last one.  Yes police can do this if you were the first person to buy it but if you bought the gun from a pawn shop or at a gun show or other places where sales are not tracked, it is basically impossible to figure out where the gun came from besides where it was originally sold.

Addressing your points about stolen guns.  It is not hard to think of a way to remedy this.  Simply have a place to report when your gun is stolen.  I do not think that it is unreasonable to require people to report a stolen gun in a timely manner after all it is a weapon and it is dangerous, the police should know if it has fallen into the wrong hands.  Even if you didn't it does not necessarily mean you would go to jail.  A fine or a small misdemeanor charge for failing to report your gun as stolen would be fair and not very burdensome.  

As for the gun store being robbed thing.  I would think if they dont do this already, a gun store would have an inventory of what weapons they have in stock as well as the serial numbers associated with all those weapons.  Simply go through the inventory and figure out which guns were stolen and then make sure that it is noted in the registry.  When those guns start to turn up at crime scenes you can interrogate the criminals about where they got the guns from, and start to make connections and possibly figure out who the people who robbed the store are, if you haven't already caught them from security footage and other evidence from the crime scene.

I do not think that a gun registry would fall apart from a few stores or people getting robbed.  I think the bigger problem for a gun registry would be the huge amount of guns on the market right now that are not registered.  But this could also be addressed with some simple but effective measures.  You don't have to require everyone to come register all their guns now or go to jail.  You could simply start requiring that all sales and transactions from a certain date forward must be logged and imputed into the registry.  Then its as simple as targeting seller that are not following the regulation.  Over time the registry would grow as new guns enter the market and old ones are bought and sold and are added to the registry.  

Now obviously there will be a black market, but there is already a black market for guns.  The idea is over time with more and more guns will be registered it will steadily make it easier to keep track of how guns are getting from stores to crime scenes.

You can imagine a lot of these regulations like regulations on owning a car.  In fact owning and driving a car is much harder than owning and using a gun in most circumstances.  For a car in order to own and drive it you must have a drivers liscence, the car must be registered to you, you must re-register each year and pay apropriate taxes and your car must be inspected each year there are tons of things like this for cars.  What I am proposing here for guns is only one small part of the tons of stuff you already have to do for a car.  All you would have to do is register the gun in your name, and when it is sold to someone else you must report them as the new owner.  the same way that when you sell someone a car the ownership must be transfer to their name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude chill out we are having a nice discussion here no need to explode.  

Let me explain.  In my opinion what I said is constitutional.(It's just my opinion it's not a big deal)  I don't think that the second amendment was ever intended to cover things like cannons, mortars, RPGs, and automatic weapons.  I also think that the 2nd amendment does not mean that reasonable regulations can not be placed upon the sale of firearms.  I think basic things like background checks and a nationally regulated gun registry are perfectly reasonable regulations.  I also feel the about hand guns the same way that you feel about explosives that you should be able to get them but it should not be as easy as a rifle.  

I am trying to explain that it is not that our beliefs are completely different, We are just at different parts of the spectrum.  One end of the spectrum is ban on all fire arms/weapons, and the other end is buy whatever weapon you want without restrictions.  

As for the Second Amendment, the constitution was designed to be able to be modified.  I don't necessarily think it should be, but the second amendment is not the end all be all.  After all the 18th amendment bans alcohol, but obviously that got changed.  The Constitution was designed to be difficult to change not impossible, and the Founding fathers made it with the full intention that it would change in the years to come.

Just to be clear I am not saying we should get rid of the 2nd amendment.  I just wanted to make that clear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you don't understand what innocent until proven guilty is.  IUPG means they can't put you in jail until they actually convict you with a crime.  Basically you can not be labeled a murderer until they actually convict you of the murder.

In this case they would charge you with not doing the gun registration correctly, and then it would go to court and you would either be convicted or not convicted.  

Until you actually are convicted they **can not** put you in jail and hold you indefinitely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not saying it would be 100 percent perfect, but having a gun registry would make it much easier to see where guns are going at least on the legal side.  As I said above.  Yea one stolen gun would not be something that a gun registry would work well against but if the gun registry has tracked a bunch of stolen guns back to you over time it starts looking a lot like those guns were not stolen by accident (AKA straw buyer.).  The point is not that it would be perfect, but it would make a huge difference with keeping track of guns and how they are they are ending up at crime scenes.  Imagine if you are arrested for a drug crime and they find a gun all they have to do to check if it is legally bought or not is go to the gun registry and see if you are the legal owner.  Right now they pretty much have no idea how you got it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course gun registration would not be very effective against one guy but when they have tracked down 5 guns to you you start to look a bit more suspicious.  

Also about existing laws that are similar to gun registration.  They are a joke.  Usually only the first sale needs to be logged or is logged and some of the laws say that the log is not allowed to be kept on a computer, which is crazy.  Plus I believe none of them are interstate which makes them almost pointless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok I hope you see this, because this is important to me.  

I support more gun control.  I am not one of those guys that has never touched a gun.  I personally own a 20 gauge Remington 1100 shotgun, and a my family has a 410 as well as a rifle and an antique double barrel shotgun.  I have shot guns on many occasions I have shot pistols, rifles, and shotguns.  I enjoy skeet shooting although I have not had the time to go lately.  

That said I support significantly more restrictions on guns than what we have now.  I am not saying we should get rid of guns, but it should not be as simple as going to a pawn shop or gun convention and just handing over the cash.  

These are weapons not toys and can kill you and others.  That is the first thing you ever learn when learning to handle a gun.  Yet in many cases buying gun is easier and requires much less time or over-site than buying a car.

I support some very basic but effective forms of gun legislation.

1. A national gun registry.  The reason for this is simple.  If you start tracking who owns which guns it will be easier to track down who the last legal owner was.  Gun advocates like to say criminals will not follow the laws, and that is true, but 99% of guns originate from a legal source.  Some guy buying a gun in a gun store or a gander mountain or something.  The trick to reducing the amount of illegal guns is tracking down who is buying them legally and then selling them illegally(straw buyers).  A gun registry would create a history for a gun and then it would be as simple as going to the last legal owner and asking what happened to the gun afterwords.  Perhaps asking why he or the guy he sold it to did not go through the correct procedures of registering the gun with the new owner.  
The problem is right now the police find a gun at a crime scene, and they don't even know where it came from.  It could have originated from practically anywhere and that makes it incredibly hard to track down who these straw buyers are.  
2. Secondly I support universal background checks for all sales private or public.  If you want to buy a gun we should make sure you are sane, and not a criminal, its that simple.
3. Last, and this is not as important as the first two, I support significantly more restrictions on handguns compared to shotguns and rifles.  They are small and concealable and that makes them much more dangerous.  If you want to own one I think you should have to jump through a few more hoops.  The fact is it is a lot easier to commit a crime with a hand gun than a rifle.

Now I understand that these would not be 100% effective off the bat.  But the idea is over time you would be reducing the amount of illegal weapons and keeping much better track of the ones out there. As well as making it harder for criminals and crazy people to get ahold of them.  

Please tell me what you think I'd like to know what you think about the things I proposed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your logic is good, but it looks like the problem here was not landing, but moving too fast sideways while landing.  They landed right in the center of the the drone ship.  

Plus with your C130 option assuming you could make it so a C130 could carry the first stage, how would you detach the 1st stage so the C130 could land? </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of these things have been building, there is a significant amount of the population that has cameraphones now compared to the mid 2000s when it was still a novelty.  Second police did not suddenly get better armed, and start pushing the limits of their authority immediately after 9/11, it has been a slow and gradual process.  Eventually people get tired of it though.  

Many people forget that moments like this take a long time, the main part of the civil rights movement took over a decade.  

Police have been pushing the limits for a while now.  and with recent revelations about overreaches in areas like civil forfeiture, and police brutality, people are starting to push back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone, I googled, but could not find a definitive answer to my question.  Recently I bought a Spektrum DX-8 transmitter i am looking for some receivers.  My question is if it says in the description of the receiver that it is DSM2/DSMX compatible, does that mean it will be compatible with my Spektrum transmitter?  

I understand Spektrum transmitters use DSM2 and DSMX but I want to be sure they will be compatible before I buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fairings are already made of carbon-fiber which is inherently hi-temperature resistant and probably would not require much additional material to survive Mars entry.

You don't know what you are talking about.  Making the fairings into heat shields would require major modifications, and  add a great deal of weight.  Saying they are both carbon while sort of true, excludes the fact, that they are manufactured completely differently.  The fairings are made of an aluminum carbon honeycomb, meaning most of the volume is air.  Heat shields on the other hand tend to be thick, relatively dense compared to the fairings, and designed to ablate away when reaching high temperatures.  In order to get a fairing to not melt and break up when entering at the extreme velocities from orbit and beyond orbit, you would basically need to attach a giant heat shield to your fairing.

What does this mean for your theory?  You would need to attach a heat shield to the outside of the whole fairing in order to make it even plausibly into a heat shield.  Which makes you think why are we attaching a giant heavy heat shield to the entire outside of this fairing instead of just to our spacecraft.

The benefits are not there,  why would you use the fairings which you will have to heavily modify when you could just take along a heat shield that is specifically designed for the purpose.

Read the other posts too they offer other good more plausible reasons to why they would want to recover the fairings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have very basic CSS experience, I have been mostly working off of the template over at /r/redplanet that some other guy made. But I have been getting more experienced. 

You can see my version at /r/opportunityrover and /r/New_Horizons  If you are interested in either of them I can make them work on /r/AvailableSubs. 

I can change some basic stuff in this template like the height and color of the header, and the size font and color of the name of the Sub.  

I can work on adding other stuff if you are interested, just tell me what you want and I'll see if I can to it.  Like I said I am still a bit of a beginner.

Edit: I was looking at /r/startups and it is a variation of the /r/naut/ theme if you want I can work on installing the /r/naut theme for you as well.

Edit2: I was looking around and found some other themes that you may be interested in.  Take a look at /r/MindasHQ, /r/edurne, /r/boxed, and /r/flatblue if you are interested, i should be able to do any of these themes as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the point of the documentary was not to come out with any crazy new revelations about Scientology, but to bring the information to the masses.  

Before the movie I knew scientology was weird, and they harassed their former members and stuff, but i did not realize how messed up it really was.  Extorting people of money, keeping people confined through mental abuse.  I think there are many people like me that sort of knew a little bit about Scientology and that it was weird, but didn't really know about the really truly crazy stuff it has done.

<TEXT> Dude get your facts strait.  Your quote is completely out of context.

When you actually read what he was saying you realize it is not that ridiculous.

It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future. 

The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt  it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted, "Muslims, Christians, we are one." The future must not belong to those who bully women  it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons. 

The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources  it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the women and men that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support. 

**The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied.** 

Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims and Shiite pilgrims. It's time to heed the words of Gandhi: "Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit." Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them. That is what America embodies, that's the vision we will support.

The rest of the speech is here (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/25/remarks-president-un-general-assembly)

And a video of the part of the speech you are referring to (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6uZFSj_ueM)

Before you go shouting out these quotes, you should look and see where they come from and see what they actually mean in the context that they were spoken. </TEXT>

The important thing is to question what you are seeing.  cross check what you see on one site against others, did what they said hold water?

Also it concerns me just as much when MSNBC tells half truths or blatant lies, as when Fox does it.

Edit: I just wanted to say I don't watch MSBC I get tired of feeling like I am being lied to, even if I do agree with what they are saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In US only about [50% of people vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections) in presidential elections, and for midterms(the elections in-between presidential elections) that numeber is [more like 30-40%](http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/).  So it is a big problem here.

As for taxes you have a fair point and I agree with you, taxes are necessary, but in the US a lot of people see forcing people to pay taxes as against their rights.  

As for Jury Duty, this is actually very interesting to me, how does Sweden get people to come to jury duty if it is not mandatory?

And to address the police question, as I said in the post you would receive a fine, police would not arrest people for not voting.

Also you could make the fine proportional to your income. So a rich person would pay a much larger fine than a poor person.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should Voting be Mandatory? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-04 19:56:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few things first.  In order to avoid unnecessary arguments.

* You do not have to vote for anyone if you do not want to.  This is the case now and would theoretically continue to be the case.  You would go get your ballot, and if you wanted to you could leave it completely blank.  The point is you showed up. 
* Taking examples from other countries, the penalty for not voting would be a fine.
* We are assuming there would be sufficient early voting times and possibly make election day a national holiday.

I don't know if there is anything I missed.  I would like to hear what people think.

Personally I support mandatory voting, as it would eliminate a lot of the problems we have now like poor people not having the time/money to go vote, and disenfranchisement of parts of the population.

Edit: /u/DeShawnMann brought up a good point to start this would only be for national and state elections.

<TEXT> Not immediately, but astronauts have been evacuated to the Soyuze capsules during problems or high risk times.  Usually they are evacuated to Soyuze and then they wait for further info and directions from the ground.  In Soyuze they are pretty safe, because the capsules are capable of providing life support to the astronauts, and landing capabilities if that becomes necessary.  No sense being hasty and landing all the astronauts when the problem is small and can be easily fixed.  

I just realized your question was about air leaks immediately after docking.  I suppose it matters how bad the air leak is, and what is causing it.  It might just be the seal didn't line up very well during docking, in this case just dock again and see if the seal is better.  On the other hand if there is a physical defect in the rubber seal that can not be fixed, I suppose NASA would be left with no options but to land.  In the mean time Soyuze has enough resources to sustain the three people in the capsule for at least a few days it is likely that NASA would use at least a couple days to work on a solution before sending Soyuze back to earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the bigger question is could we afford another war that drags on for that long.  The Iraq war is estimated to have cost almost [4 trillion dollars](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-iraq-war-anniversary-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314).  And in your argument you say we should have stayed longer.  How long were we supposed to stay?  Was Obama supposed to keep troops in Iraq for another 8 years?  I don't think the US could have afforded to stay much longer.

Other points:

* Iran is much larger than Iraq, and would require more resources to effectively control than Iraq did.  
* We would receive even less support for an Iran invasion than we did for Iraq.  This would mean higher costs and back lash from the international community which might lend substance to the arguments of some other countries like Russia, and possibly lead to unforeseen consequences and backlash.
* On the subject of cost our debt is already in somewhat of a precarious situation.  adding to it by trillions would not help, and possibly if circumstances were not favorable push the United States to a default.


My last point and in my opinion what i think is our best course of action.

Many younger Iranians have become somewhat disillusioned with the ultra conservativeness of their government.(enforcing headscarves, no dancing with the opposite gender outside your family, restrictions on western clothing...) There is a good chance this will lead to political change within the country if we give it time.  Invading would most certainly destroy these political movements.  It would play right into the hands of the government who has been preaching for years about how the US is horrible and they will attempt to destroy us if we give them the chance.  Right now the government is becoming the bad guy for many young Iranians.  Invading preemptively would fulfill the Iranian governments predictions, and make us the bad guys.  

It might be best if we let the foundations of the government slowly erode and let these social movements work over time while holding Iran to the terms of the agreement.  It's not like we our blind US intelligence will almost certainly find out if Iran begins working on building nuclear weapons and if they do we can act accordingly.

Edit: I realized after rereading that I didn't quite address your argument.  Basically I am saying yes Iraq was relatively stable compared to a few years before, but at what cost?  It is likely that no matter when we puled out Iraq was going to have problems. Were willing to continue to spend over 400 billion dollars a year just to keep a country stable?   and are we willing to create that situation for ourselves all over again? </TEXT>

From the daily dot article i read, it sounds like /r/atheism was just becoming a place with a lot of loud atheist bigots.

I even feel weird reading over the comments there, because even though i agree with most of the stuff, I am realizing more and more that it is an echo chamber of liberal ideology and politics.  So i am guessing they got rid of /r/politics because it was becoming less about politics and more like /r/democrats.

This is just people not thinking.  its like saying we need to design cars without tires because we got a flat one time.  Maybe it is more practical just to take along a spare.

You can see the glass ~~wax~~ plug at the end of the red stick on the sprinkler head.

Edit2: ~~Wax not glass, thanks /u/bostonfire15~~

Edit3: /u/sfall showed proof that /u/bostonfire15 was incorrect.  Thanks /u/sfall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea I felt like that is my biggest disappointment with Korra there is no overarching plot from season to season.  In ATLA every season was working towards the eventual confrontation with Ozai.  Because of that you got to see a lot more character progression, on the part of the good guys, but more importantly, on the part of the bad guys.  Ozai starts off as this shadow and you never even see his face.  By the 3rd season he is completely menacing, and there has been a ton of back story on his relationships to other characters. There were still minor villans and seasonal plot points, like Zaho attacking the north, and Azula taking over the Earth kingdom, but they were made that much deeper because they had significance towards the final plot of beating Ozai.

In Korra on the other hand each season has to completely introduce you to a new set of villans and a new plot objective each season, which really takes away from the sieres as a whole, because each season is pretty insignificant to the next.

I would have liked to see some sort of overarching plot like ATLA. 

PS: I think one of the best opportunities they had with Korra was with her loosing all her bending but her airbending.  I feel like they could have made the whole next season about her developing her Airbending skills to mastery and eventually getting back her other bending skills.  I felt disappointed that she basically lost her skills, and then got them right back, it was a huge missed opportunity for a great plot, and a really interesting opportunity to develop her character more.  ohh well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> American companies are notorious for penny pinching and treating employees like machines and resources rather than real people.  Would you give the delivery truck vacation time? Would you give the computer vacation time?  Why should we give the employees vacation time?  Unless there is some sort of financial incentive that is easy to calculate on an excel doc the company does not care.

This is what is bad about penny pinching and trying to make the bottom line.  You end up making the employees your enemy.  In a company that has the employees back, the employees will defend the company , and put in the extra effort.  At companies that focus on the bottom line and treat their employees like crap, you will have a whole army of employees that bad mouth the company when they are off work, and will never put the extra effort in to help out. 

It also tends to piss everyone off that the employees will take a pay-cut, and then the CEOs get raises for increasing profits.  It is just ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing on the tv is a really bad scene from the absolutely horrible  movie who's name [must not be written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Airbender).  

It is so bad that I almost wish they would make a remake just so we could permanently delete this movie.  And I didn't like the idea of a movie adaptation to begin with.  That is how bad this movie is I almost wish they would make one that is less bad just to get rid of this one... almost.  

Honestly idk why they had to make a live action version, I think it wold have been so much better to make an animated movie that continued the plot.  I really hope they don't make a live action Korra.  Just stay animated, that way you can keep the same voices and everything.  That or make a live action about a completely different story line, maybe about earlier Avatars or something.  When you try to make a live action about a story line that is already animated, you have a 95% chance of disappointing everyone.  It's like movie adaptations of books, except much much worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you have to watch how much you skip in series like this.  A lot of times you don't realize it but there was character development going on that you didn't even realize was happening.  even insignificant episodes can help you get attached to a character.  

(TLDR):Skipping episodes only makes the series worse for yourself because you miss small things that end up adding to the overall plot.

Edit: There are some times in some series when skipping episodes is necessary because the episode significantly hurts the series.  Avatar is not one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is because west coast launches are

1. At a higher latitude than the east coach making the launches less efficient (You need a bigger rocket to get the same mass to the same place.).
2. Need to depart over the pacific ocean for range safety which is perfect for polar launches, but not so great for anything trying to go into LEO, or LEO transfer to Mars because now you are overflying land and people.  

idk these are my best guesses why the west coast tends to be less popular.  Anybody knows more please tell me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the problem with this logic is it assumes people who vote know the issues and people who don't don't.  Right now there are plenty of people that vote that have no idea about any of the issues they just vote because the heard a comercial, or thats what the party is said to do.  You cant pick and choose who votes, and in my opinion I think requiring you to vote might influence some of those less informed people to actually pay attention and understand the issues a little better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the big thing here i when teaching students they need to start off learning how to use the less intuitive instruments like the VOR just as with most things in flying it is important not to get overly dependent on one thing.  The problem with the GPS is it is so easy especially for beginners to become over reliant on what the GPS says.  If the GPS were to cut out they would be completely lost.  That is why it is important to not over rely on the GPS, not because it is not a good and effective tool, but because it can make you a worse pilot in terms of ability if you let it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is not necessarily the people fault for believing it.  Most people are not that into space stuff, and would not be able to tell the difference between a legitimate organization like NASA and a bogus one like Mars One.  It is really the media's fault.  It would have taken 20 minutes of research to figure out Mars One was sketchy at best and more likely a scam.  But as usual these days.  it seems like the media did zero research before publishing exactly what Mars One told them.  And they wonder why people are not bothering to watch anymore. </TEXT>

Mars One = We will have colonists on mars in 10 years.  No real explanation how.

SpaceX = We are currently working on developing cheaper reusable rocket technology, as well as a larger more capable rocket that will be able to go to mars.  If everything keeps going well we will be looking at developing a more firm Mars plan in a few years.

Huge difference, although the media wont really care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea thats how I feel, it is so refreshing to see the progress being made, and after years of getting used to the leisurely to snail pase of NASA's R D, it is amazing and almost takes your breath away to see how fast SpaceX is developing new technology.  

Don't get me wrong, I love NASA, they are doing a lot of cool stuff, like [STEREO A and B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO) (Where all our cool sun pictures come from), [Opportunity Rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_\(rover\)), [Curiosity Rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_\(rover\)), [Dawn Ceres mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_\(spacecraft\)), [Messenger Mercury mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER), [Cassini Saturn Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens), [Juno Jupiter Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_\(spacecraft\)), and the big one coming up in only a couple months, [New Horizons Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons)!!! :D  and those are just the main active missions, there are tons that have come and gone in the last 5 years.   

But I feel like as of late they have been progressively been getting more and more starved for cash, and politics has been really affecting their ability to get things accomplished.  I hope that SpaceX pushing the limits will indirectly help NASA get out of the funk its in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What do you mean?  I feel like bill gates made some huge revolutions in the technology market.  I feel like microsoft even though it is kind of clunky was the bridge between computers in the early 90's and the computer we have today.

Computers early 90s = No internet doesn't do much.

Computers today = internet, google earth, tablet computers, smartphones, indirectly the Ipod, and basically every other personal electronic.

Plus in the 90's computers were not that common and internet looked like a middle schooler made all the web pages.  Today virtually every household has a computer, and the internet is the place it is today.

I would say he had a huge impact.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello I came across [this 1973 Beetle](http://auto.mercadolibre.com.ec/MEC-406684146-volkswagen-escarabajo-1973-_JM) here in Ecuador.  I have been tossing around the idea of buying the car and driving it back to the USA as an awesome road trip, and also because it seems like a great deal.  

I am wondering what I am going to have to do to legally buy this car in Ecuador so that I can drive it on this road trip?  I am an American on a student visa if that affects anything.

<TITLE> Interested in Driving Beetle From Ecuador to USA. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-07 22:39:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello I came across [this 1973 Beetle](http://auto.mercadolibre.com.ec/MEC-406684146-volkswagen-escarabajo-1973-_JM) here in Ecuador.  I have been tossing around the idea of buying the car and driving it back to the USA as an awesome road trip, and also because it seems like a great deal.  

I wanted to know if anyone has any experience "importing" a classic beetle like this what kind of paper work will be necessary at the border?  Are there any issues I might not anticipate?  

I am mostly concerned with the logistic issues of getting it into the US and having it be street legal.

They are getting this model glider up to some pretty ridiculous speeds, how are they doing it?  and what kind of maneuver are they flying?  its just hard to understand where the energy is coming from to accelerate the plane like this.  I understand it has to do with the way the wind is hitting the ridge, but i don't get what it is that is actually happening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello I was commenting on a thread over in /r/Multicopter  and a dispute began about whether you are allowed to take aeriel pictures and sell them with a PPL.  I wanted to find a third party to decide who is right.  Here is a link to the thread.  
http://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2uykpp/fly_commercially_legal_with_this_multirotor_tether/cod7e07

/u/terrymr brings up some good points, and I was wondering what people here thought?  I was not aware of the FAA ruling mentioned in the last post.

Please help resolve this dispute.

<TEXT> I have been working on space planes lately, and i want to make a high capacity one, but i find every time i try to build the wing sections the game acts like i have a bunch of little wings real close together instead of one giant solid wing.  basically in the hanger it looks like a big solid wing, but when i go to fly one part of the wing will flex independently of another.  How do you get the game to recognize that all the wing panels are connected? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello I have gotten xplane10, but unfortunetally where i am right now there are zero joysticks available.  I am wondering if anyone has experience using a ps3 controller or other normal videogame controller on xplane10.  I am on a mac, fully updated to yosemite,  and have access to many different types of gaming controlers, just not a joystick.  Any tips or experience is much apreciated,  I would like to start flying, but that is impossible until i fins some sort of controller.  and dont want to go out just willy nilly buying controllers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey I have had an idea, what if every week or every month or something we posted a city or area that we want to map and then everybody works together to map that area for the week.  We can make it fun by taking a before and after screenshot or something.  I just think it would be a fun way to make a lot of progress on specific areas to help and make the map better.  


A lot of times there it just feels like you can map for days and days but not much progress is being made.  I think this would be a fun way to realize a lot of progress in a specific area very quickly, and help keep people enthused.


PS: Please submit your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Simpler JOSM </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-10 22:46:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently decided to take the leap from the ID editor into JOSM I expected it to be a difficult transition but I didn't expect it to be almost impossible.  I have enjoyed editing in the ID editor, but it does have its moments of frustration,  it lags when you haven't saved for a while, you cant zoom out to get the big picture which can get claustrophobic and make large edits hard to impossible, and it wont load large objects completely, which can get confusing. For all of these reasons I decided it was time to try JOSM.  

I expected things to be different and more complicated, but after finally booting up JOSM and trying it out I have found I have trouble even drawing a simple road, much less getting back to the power editing i am used to.  I cant figure out how to pan the the view and every time i try i just end up drawing a new way.  The list goes on. 

What I have discovered is what I really want is the simplicity of the ID editor paired with the ability of JOSM to edit large areas.
Is there anything like this out there?  

I feel like i am stuck in the middle, where the ID editor is starting to feel confining and limiting, but JOSM is so complicated, that i end up spending 5 minutes just trying to trace a simple road.


Edit: thanks for all the help the shortcuts make a huge difference, thank you for all the help guys. </TEXT>

<TITLE> ESC to Motor Question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-06 04:34:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So i am trying to buy a motor and ESC's and it was recomended to me [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2le7uo/trying_to_build_quad/clu1ha0) to use a motor that has a max draw of around 6-8 amps with a 10 amp esc, you can see the links.  The problem is the ESC's are out of stock.  Is there any problem (besides extra weight) with going with a [20 Amp ESC](http://www.myrcmart.com/rcx-20a-sky-simonk-brushless-esc-for-multicopter-24s-p-8063.html) instead of the recommended [10 Amp ESC](http://www.myrcmart.com/product_info.php?products_id=6994)?

<DATE> 2014-10-24 06:18:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have been doing a lot of mapping in southern Mexico and Guatemala  There is this one spot of complete forrest, but it is gigantic.  I am wondering how to go about mapping this? one giant polygon? many small polygons?  Are there other options?  As you can see I have already drawn two relatively large polygons.  


Forrest area I am referring to [here](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/16.1448/-91.0193).


Ps: Also if anyone is looking for a project this area is almost completely unmapped. Would love help if anyone is interested. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just finally updated to .24, and while the new boosters are really cool, they seem like they are just a bit too powerful for the game. What I mean is with my very first rocket I managed to build a single stage to orbit. All I did was put two large fuel tanks and the super powerful quad engine on and tada I made it to orbit with fuel to spare.  That just seems too easy and defeating the purpose of the game. 


Edit: To clarify I am talking about the new super powerful engines and super large tanks not the little white SRB's. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is This a Runway or Not a Runway? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-04 01:00:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I am mapping in the middle of nowhere in Chiapas Mexico and i come across this little town (http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=17/16.48792/-91.30753) unlike many of the other towns that I have seen in the local area, this one seems to have a cleared out area at the center of the town which looks an awful lot like a runway.  What do you guys think?  Is it a runway?


Edit: (http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=17/16.56118/-91.36165) This is another example this one seems much more likely to be a runway but would like to know for sure before i go runway mapping crazy.


Edit2: Now that I am getting way farther into the back country I am seeing this a lot more.  I am seeing a lot of towns that also don't seem to have any roads leading to them which would make it seem very likely that these are grass runways, which seems to be a common phenomenon in jungle villages of Central and Southern America .


Edit:3 This is a real thing, many central american towns do not have any roads, and their main connection with the outside world is through small bush planes.

<TEXT> I understand that the computers in an airbus will not let the airplane preform beyond its minimums and maximums for example the computer will not let the plane stall.  I have heard that these computer imposed limits make it so that the pilot can not cross control an airbus i was wondering if this was true? </TEXT>

<TITLE> "The Snow Walker" opinion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-04 20:03:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just watched a movie called The Snow walker, it was a great movie, I would definitely suggest it if you haven't seen it.  
For those that have seen it, what did you guys think, especially about the ending?

[**Warning spoilers**]

I thought the ending was so sad I was wondering what the meaning of her foot steps ending, and the white owl were.  
In my opinion I really wish that they both had made it, it was so sad when she disappeared to die, and the scene of him creating a tomb for her and him putting her things inside, was almost more sad for me than when he couldn't find her. </TEXT>

I was wondering if there were any recourses on the procedure for interacting with class B and C airspace, so I could study.  I have worked with a  control tower before but have not had the chance to go into class B or C space and wanted to study up so I don't screw it up when I do need to fly into controlled space like this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thrust to Weight Ratio for Different Places. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-03 19:10:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am playing the in career mode and am currently sending some landers to Minmius to get a bunch of science.  The only problem is because Minmius has lower gravity, the thrust to weight ratios change in their SOI.  I have given them very small Engins with low TTWR but I am afraid when I get there the engine might still be too powerful (lowest power setting is still too much).  Is there any way to calculate the change without actually going to Minmius?  Basically TWR of 1 on Kerbal is equal to x TWR on Mun and x TWR on Minmius.  </TEXT>
