<TEXT> I don't think Saul is dead, yet. When Saul asked to speak to Carrie on the phone when he first escaped, he made her promise to take him out if he were to be captured again and Carrie failed to keep this promise. She had to deal with the emotions that followed that decision. I think somehow Saul gets "captured" or taken again by Haqqani, thus Carrie will have to deal a similar decision of killing both Haqqani and Saul, OR there is a possibility of Saul taking his own life while killing Haqqani at the same time. Either way, I think Saul's capture really took a toll on Saul not only physically but mentally and morally. When it comes down to it either Carrie "pulls the trigger" killing Saul and Haqqani, or Saul does it. Either way I'm ready for the new episode now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes these are Pi Phis, and yes they did in fact win Greek Week this year, but this picture is not from that. It's actually from last year or two years ago for derby days. None the less, roll tide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I go to a sec school and this shit gets published about 3 times a week in our university newspaper. The paper has become so antigreek, the whole publication is a joke. It's a shame that the positives of philanthropy and brother/sisterhood get thrown under the bus just because I "buy my friends"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a couple games that we have done before. 

The first is beer dodgeball, which could be it's own event all together. It's played like regular dodgeball but when you get hit, you have to chug a beer in order to get back in. Once you've finished the beer you are allowed to continue playing. Once you throw up, you're out. Great way to get really drunk. 

The second game isn't so much a game but it could be made into one, Dunk-a-Roos. You fill a trash can with water and ice. Next you get a beer ready to shotgun. Then you dunk you're head in the water for 10-20 seconds. Then you shotgun you're beer. Like I said not really a game but it's an awesome thing to do especially on a hot day when your fraternity is having a day party. For an added thrill, have some brother hold your feet up when you dunk your head in like a keg stand.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest man, I would wait until next fall. I know at my school, spring pledges are kind of a joke, and most fraternities don't really even do spring pledgeship. Fall pledgeship is when most guys pledge and this means your pledge class will be a lot bigger. My advice, rush all this spring. Find the guys you fit in with the best. Then come summer you can work a save up for dues. That's just my opinion but best of luck man!  </TEXT>
