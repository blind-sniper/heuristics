<TEXT> A former friend of mine showed up at my house around 3:30am demanding I give his damn dog back.  He was yelling and cursing so loud the neighbors came outside.  He ripped the railing off my porch and the shutter from a front window because I wouldn't let him inside to get his dog.  I couldn't convince him to leave, so I called another friend to come get him, which he did.  I didn't have his dog because he never had one to begin with.  Cocaine. </TEXT>

What a harsh video.  If this is how he controls a 110 lb. drunk girl maybe he needs to rethink his effectiveness as a police officer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 32 U.S. dog bite-related fatalities occurred in 2013. Despite being regulated in Military Housing areas and over 700 U.S. cities, pit bulls contributed 78% (25) of these deaths. Pit bulls make up about 6% of the total U.S. dog population.

Together, pit bulls (25) and rottweilers (1), the second most lethal dog breed, accounted for 81% of the total recorded deaths in 2013. This same combination accounted for 74% of all fatal attacks during the 9-year period of 2005 to 2013.

<TEXT> Turkey was home to the 4th and last Caliphate, abolished in 1924.  The last was Abdulmecid II of the Ottoman Dynasty. He was replaced by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, know as the Father of secular Turkey 1923. He sought to westerize the country which conflicted with conservative Muslm beliefs.  This lead to an identity crisis for the country: go back to our roots in a glorious caliphate that was admired, or become a secular western country.  The man elected as the 12th President, Recep Erdogan,  doesn't like the secular model and is trying to return the country to a caliphate, with himself as the caliph. He views ISIL, and similar groups, as his way to achieve that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> UPDATE:

Apsara Authority declared that it had arrested two more foreigners for taking nude pictures at Preas Khan temple yesterday.

According to the declaration, Apsara Authority with the cooperation from Tourist Police Unit in Siem Reap and Heritage Protection Division in Siem Reap had prevented the act of taking nude pictures at Preas Khan temple around 10:00 am on 06/ Feb/ 2015. The foreigners are Lindsey Kate ADAMS, 22 years old and Leslie Jan ADAMS, 20 years old. Both of them are American.

Mr Koy Sao (Judge of Siem Reap Court) had declare on Saturday that the court decided to imprisoned them 6 months with 1,000,000 riel fine for each and banned them for re-entering Cambodia for 4 years, as they were charged of

trafficking pornography and exposing sexual organs

in Article 39, paragraph 3 of the law on human trafficking and sexual exploitation in Article 249 of the Penal Code.

However, the punishment was suspended in accordance with Article 107,109,111 of the Penal Code.

Mr Koy Sao added,  Both of them confessed that they had taken nude pictures at the temple.

Both of them will be expelled from Cambodia tonight by bus from Siem Reap to Bangkok, Thailand.

<TEXT> I'm late fifties worrying about nothing and enjoying this fine bottle of Pinot Noir tonight.  You kids shouldn't worry so much about your bills.  They'll get paid, one way or another,  Worry about the man or woman you're sharing your life with, if you have one.  If you don't have one, get a dog.  Or a cat. Or something that's alive and needs you.  Just be glad for this moment, this very minute you're alive.  It's fucking glorious, man.  So many people didn't wake up this morning, but you did.  Worry only gets you high blood pressure and long-term drug dependence, problems with loved ones, intestinal issues and surgery for bleeding ulcers.  Choose to be happy no matter your present conditions.  Go listen to some Pink Floyd and have a nice glass of wine with a friend.  Or alone, either way.  Life is good and it's good to be here on this Earth with all its' beauty and nice clean air and water.  Plus!, we have the benefit of Mexican food.  Holy hell,  we don't need anything else to be happy, unless it's a good blackberry margarita outside under the big umbrella with some fabulous Mexican food.  Life is so good.  I'm so glad I have it.  I might be a fucking hippie in my mind though, so there
 is that. </TEXT>

 They paved paradise
 And put up a parking lot."

<TEXT> What's the point of having it operate so differently on this one subject?  Who's going to decide what's important enough for threads like this and what isn't?  This defeats the purpose of the way reddit operates.  If I wanted randomized, I'd choose randomized.  I cannot tell what's new and what isn't.  I prefer it the regular way.  If I get overburdened with content of one kind or another I just scroll down and skip it.  This takes away choices and I do not support it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no lost knowledge, it's been written for thousands of years.

The Bible has nearly 800 references to Jerusalem- called the City of our God (Ps. 48:1,8) Jerusalem is Gods city, the city of Zion, he has invested his name there (Daniel 9:19).

Jerusalem is called the city of the great King (Matt.5:35). YHWH is called the God of Israel, He is not called the God of any other nation in this manner, The God of Jerusalem is key to the Jewish people, to Jesus and to the end of the age.

Zion is called the city of God. Isa 60:14: and they shall call you The City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. It is where the Lord has and will dwell again. Joel 3:21: for the LORD dwells in Zion. When the temple permanently replaced the tabernacle and was built in Jerusalem it became the place of his dwelling, his presence was there, thus name Zion.

Ps. 132:13-14: For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling place: This is My resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. Ps. 87:1-3: His foundation is in the holy mountains. The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah </TEXT>

<TEXT> You see how monolithic, slow, burdensome and unresponsive our federal government is. How in the hell could you possibly think that letting some jokers run the whole world would be anything but an abysmal failure?  As much as I like the idea of a completely free world where everyone has constitutional rights, I dont trust the government to keep their promise. Its great in concept but in reality, I think if it were attempted to be applied, we would get a much different point of view that turns out to not be such a good thing. I dont think the guys that wrote our Constitution had that much faith in government either, which is why a lot of the things in the Constitution were written specifically to limit the role and the amount of power that the govt had.

1.) It would inevitably become perverted, corrupt, and totalitarian, no matter how it started out.

2.) It's much better to have a variety of government policies for the diverse cultures of the world than one single set that everyone shares.

3.) If a one world government was in place, it's not for the benefit of humanity. The elite, those above the government, these people you never see...presidents and other politicians are controlled by them. They only have their own benefit in mind. All they want from us are the power of our thoughts, our money and fruits of our labors, controlled and manipulated through media, entertainment, military and education. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched a video once where they took a bunch of plants and divided them into two groups.  They separated the two and hooked the second group up to electrodes that measured their electric impulses.  In an area separated by a wall, they chopped up a plant from the first group.  As they whacked away, the electrodes recorded highly increased activity in the plants that were separated, as if they were screaming whenever the plant was cut.  Weird stuff.  Also, the movement of plant roots as they grow seem to be purposeful movement and always head towards the nutrients, crowding out non-relative plants to the point of their deaths.  Some plants send out distress signals to predator insects while being eaten by certain insects, so that predator insects will come and destroy the insect that's eating the host plant.  Daughter vines can "smell" the type of plant they want to attach to, so my question is, how do they do all this without a brain?  It's purposeful behaviour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are so many things in your comment that I disagree with, but I'll comment on this one: 

"Society cannot correctly set and achieve it's goals without the direction and vision of government because it is controlled by the ignorant horde that we know as the masses."

Do you not understand that you are also considered one of the ignorant masses?  Societies can't set or achieve goals *because of* governments like you're suggesting.  Politicians of any sort aren't ones to be trusted with the common good, just the opposite.  They enjoy their corrupting activities and having control.  They're egomaniacs who have only their own best interests in view.

<TEXT> "religion makes people easier to rule".   I can't agree less on this point.

"I don't want to directly force religion onto people because that causes the masses to resent authority".  People resent authority, religiously oriented or not and you cannot force religious belief at all.  

"via, evolution God's means of creating etc" You cannot force someone to mentally accept what they do not agree with.

"government should be geared toward the advancement of human intelligence and ability".  No, this is not the responsibility of government, it is the responsibility of society.  It is generally agreed that the most important single function of government is to secure the rights and freedoms of individual citizens. Thomas Jefferson asked:  "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath?" Government becomes primarily a mechanism for defense against bodily harm, theft and involuntary servitude. It cannot claim the power to redistribute the wealth or force reluctant citizens to perform acts of charity against their will. Government is created by the people, for the people, not for an oligarch. </TEXT>

No, neither are conducive to progress, only to eventual self-destruction.  A completely new paradigm would be needed for "progress".

<TEXT> My grandfather liked a particular story about when my dad was dating my mom.  My dad would sometimes walk to their house to see her and hang out or help my granddad around their place, just do whatever came up.  They lived down a long, dirt road with tall pine trees on both sides and they could see him coming.  One day my mom was sitting on the porch watching him walk towards the house, when my granddad burst out of the screen door with a gun, yelled for my mom to get inside, scaring her to death.  She saw my dad, then the gun, and started yelling, "No, daddy, no!" because she thought he was going to shoot him.  Grandad pushed her inside while holding the door open, when all of a sudden my dad started running as fast his legs could carry him.  He raced onto the porch just as the gun went off, but turned his head just in time to see the big black panther stumble behind him.  Grandad saved my dad from the jaws and claws of death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm one of those weird people that likes working on Black Friday.  I always volunteer to work and pocket some extra money because of it.  Not a single one of my coworkers opted out of working that day because we schedule time with family around our work hours.  My community benefits economically from the holiday season, as I'm sure most due.  It's crazy to make a big deal about this and blame the retailers for somehow being unjust to employees just because it's a holiday.  We work all the other holidays too.  Not everyone works in an office Monday-Friday.  </TEXT>

Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument."

<TEXT> "I know God has forgiven me and my soul is in good shape. I can live at my cousin's house in Nebraska forever out in the middle of nowhere if that's what it takes," Ratigan said as he faced a judge. "Prison is hell. I know I deserve 15 years. Fifty years? I don't think so."

I don't think he has a soul and 50 years is just enough.  He's 47 now, so he'll never again see that cousin's house in Nebraska.  Forgiven?  No way. </TEXT>

I wouldn't tell your husband since you;ll end up holding his feelings against him.  On the other hand, you shouldn't have to hide things from him either.  My advice would be to let the past stay in the past and for you to stop chatting with this married man.  You two have a history together, but your husband is your current commitment and your future and he comes first. </TEXT>

The chef teaching the class hired her at a fine-dining restaurant he managed.  She learned so much about banquet cooking and how a kitchen actually operates.  She completed that program and is now in the baking program, since that's what she likes to do.  She did very well in school and is currently spending a month in France working with those chefs and bakers in different restaurants.  She's very good and has a great future ahead of her.

<TEXT> The effects on their economies was probably true.  Slaves helped build the economic foundations of the new nation. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 solidified the central importance of slavery to the South's economy.  That was an important factor to the rich, white landowners during the abolitionist movement. It provoked a great debate over slavery that tore the nation apart in the bloody American Civil War.  </TEXT>

"Today, it is commonly used in reference to any prophetic revelation or so-called End Time scenario, or to the end of the world in general.  

The Biblical prophets' revelations show God's justice as taking place in the future or as imminent now. The genre of revelation aims to show God's way of dealing with humankind and His ultimate purposes, and its writers often reveal the meaning of present events in connection with the ending of the present age." </TEXT>

CNN article on it here: http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/17/opinion/bergen-nsa-spying

"On Thursday, Sens. Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Democrats who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, released a statement contradicting this assertion. "Gen. Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods," the two senators said.

Indeed, a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks." </TEXT>

"I may not be walking with you all the way, or even much of the way, as I walk with you now. Dont be angry with me if I am not there in person, alive and well, when you need me. I would like nothing more than to be with you always. Do not feel sorry for me if I am gone. When we were together, I loved you deeply and you gave me so much happiness I can never repay you. Camera, wherever I am when you feel sick at heart and weary of life, or when you stumble and fall and dont know if you can get up again, think of me. I will be watching and smiling and cheering you on."

- Arthur Ashe message to his daughter, Camera

That isn't what the Bible says, it says it's written for all men, not just the ones who believe like this religion or that one.  God says pray earnestly for understanding and you'll get it.

<TEXT> Apparently, they believe the poor or stupid cannot always afford an I.D.  I take issue with this because they need an I.D. to purchase, alcohol,  cigarettes, rent or buy a home, receive welfare, food stamps, social security, unemployment and medicaid, get a driver's license, go to school, buy a gun, get a job, get married, have a bank account, buy a car or a plane ticket.  They need an I.D. to rent a hotel room, get a hunting or fishing license, give blood or to even buy certain cough medicines.  Clearly the poor make good use of these programs and purchases.  No one ever raises the income or race issue on these things, but when it comes to voting they're all over it shouting discrimination.  This makes me think that that maybe the reason these liberals don't want to require an I.D. to vote could be because they could either be bringing in illegal voters, underage people and even the names of dead people.  Poor or not, they can and do get I.D.s for all these other needs and an I.D. for voting and proving legal citizenship is not an undue burden and should be required. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A year after Amanda Berry disappeared in Cleveland, her mother appeared on "The Montel Williams Show" to speak to a psychic about what happened to her daughter.   Psychic Sylvia Browne, who has made a career of televised psychic readings, told Louwanna Miller on a 2004 episode of the show that her daughter was dead, causing Miller to break down in tears on the show's set.  "She's not alive, honey," Browne told Miller on the show.  Miller said that she believed "98 percent" in what Browne told her. Miller died a year later from heart failure. 

Amanda Berry is the women who escaped as a hostage from the home of  Ariel Castro and is very much alive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Judge Lind ruled that the 3 and 1/2 effective "years" Mr. Manning has already served since his 2010 arrest (a total inflated by time in solitary confinement) would count towards the 35-year sentence.  That leaves Mr. Manning with only 31 and 1/2 years left in the sentence.  If he does not win an appeal or get parole, he would be 56 years old when he gets out of federal prison.  However, in all likelihood he will get out long before then.  One possibility, albeit unlikely, is an appeal or a pardon.  Much more likely is the possibility of parole.  Mr. Manning's lawyer said that with military court parole rules, if Mr. Manning continues his good behavior as a prisoner, he could be eligible for parole in 6 and 1/2 years.  In that circumstance he could see freedom by the age of 32.  Being granted parole is by no means guaranteed, particularly in controversial high profile cases, but there's always hope and possibility.

He did expose war crimes to the public, along with leaking 300,000 classified documents.  He's a convicted felon, whether we agree with it or not.

<TEXT> They'll equate "separate but equal" as the stance to take to push a particular point of view. But, it isn't the same.  Anyone who lived through those times knows it isn't the same because in this instance, they'll have what they wanted legally, whereas during the civil rights movement and segregation they did not.  They do not equate since this regards nothing more than a label placed upon it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have two stories.  My sister once darted out into the road and was hit by a car.  I watched my dad woosh! over to it, pick that car up by himself and pull that child out.  She ended up with only a broken arm and he had a bit of trouble with his shoulder for a few days.  The other incident with her and my dad: she'd taken her aquarium into the bathtub to wash it(?) while he and I were outside throwing the ball around.  All of a sudden my mom let out a blood-curdling scream and, whoosh!, he was inside that bathroom, whipped off his belt and applied it as a tourniquet around her slashed up arm because she'd dropped it and it broke.  That man could move so fast he was a blur sometimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ScienceDaily is just a press release recycling service, nothing more.  They also banned BusinessWeek, The Atlantic, Phys.org and GlobalPost.  Reddit claims these sites, among others, are guilty of artificially promoting their content to make it appear more popular. In other words, they were cheating.

<TEXT> I Spit on Your Grave is a controversial 1978 rape and revenge film. The film received a limited release, with a wider release in 1980. Prominent film critics condemned the film for its graphic violence and lengthy depictions of gang rape, and the motion picture remains controversial to this day. The film was named in 2010 one of Time's Top 10 Ridiculously Violent Movies.

Yeah, I'll pass on that one.

CBS confirms reporter Sharyl Attkissons computer breached here - http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-14/lifestyle/39967790_1_cbs-news-computer-intruder

No, you aren't wrong, it isn't confirmed.  However, "the intrusions were detected in December while Attkisson was reporting almost exclusively on the governments response to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.  Attkisson has previously investigated the Justice Departments gun-tracking operation known as Fast and Furious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some groups use the Southern Cross as one of the symbols associated with their organizations, including groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.  According to Civil War historian and native Southerner Shelby Foote, the flag traditionally represented the South's resistance to Northern political dominance; it became racially charged during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, when fighting against desegregation suddenly became the focal point of that resistance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Feelings of failure or inadequacy keep us looking back.  Why did they leave me?  Why wasn't I good enough?  What did I do wrong?  Could I have fixed it?  When in reality, it was probably nothing specific we did.  We're different people as we grow and change and aren't always suited to each other during certain phases of our lives.  There's probably something in a past relationship you miss and look to remind yourself of.  Just because we aren't with them doesn't mean the feelings disappeared.  It's ok to look back every now and then, just remember you're not who you used to be and have grown since then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one can tell you whether or not you'll bond with your child.  You either want to, or you don't, it's that simple.  You're making it out to be some grand thing that no one has ever gone through before and is some great compromise you're making.  Stop it.  It's a new human being you're bringing to life and it's made from you. It's the greatest gift there is to give and is the only lasting contribution you'll probably ever make.  It's an investment in your own future.  If you don't want to end up a lonely old man you'll consider what things you'll want and will make you happy throughout your life.  For most people, it's the happiness that love and family bring.  If that isn't for you, let your wife find it elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not pontificating, I'm a grandparent who's cared for too many foster kids because of dads who didn't want to be dads.  I've far more real experience than you do, I'd bet. It's been my experience that it can go either of two ways; either he bonds with the newborn within a few days, or he does not.  If he does not, the child suffers and so does the mother since she's constantly having to make up for his lack of participation or, sometimes, abusive behaviour.  I'm sure there are some marriages that survive, but at what cost to the innocent child?  If you don't want to be called  daddy or won't step up for your own offspring, don't make someone else pay for it. </TEXT>
