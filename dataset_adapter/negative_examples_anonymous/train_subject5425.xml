<TEXT> wouldn't you consider a sick person with say cancer needing treatment or someone who needs insulin to treat diabetes as someone who might be desperate?  And where I live anyways if that person does not have a college degree they are probably making $15/hour or less...now if you add health problems, or mental health issues, caring for aging parents, addiction or any other stress, don't ya think we need to help them out?  and collectively we can make sure that those basic needs are met.  I think you are assuming people just don't want to work or pay, they just want a free ride, and sure those people are out there, but they are in the minority
For example we had a family friend when I was young who was 58 and her husband died of brain cancer.  She had health issues herself don't remember what I was young, but I do know she had metal rods in her for something. She had been a stay at home mom and her husband had worked for a place that built big bulldozers and equipment.  Well they weren't rich, but had a nice home and had saved for retirement.  When her husband died they had drained most of the savings on his medical bills then when she got sick and had to have surgery and therapy etc. she had nothing left.  She applied for aid and was denied because she owned a house, so she sold her house and moved into low income housing, had to get rid of her dog because he couldn't be there it was just such a sad story and she was such a nice sweet lady.  And all this time she was so sick too.  I guess that has made an impact on me and I don't want to see that happen to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I am outraged. I'm outraged that people are insured who should be paying out of pocket or going without treatment. I'm outraged that, to pay for it, the government has to either tax (meaning I lose money), borrow (keeping the interest rate low which means since I'm an investor rather than a borrower I lose money), or inflate the currency (which, again, since I have investments makes them worth less and I lose money

You believe some people who can't afford to pay should go without treatment?  Not everyone can afford it, but everyone is somebody's  
son, daughter, mother, father, brother, sister, or grandparent...if poor people get sick, do you believe that we should leave them to die? Is money more important that a persons life? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im no expert, but it sounds to me like you are watering too often...with my plants I water about once a week, being sure to let the top inch or so of soil dryout before I water again, and yes, remove all dead leaves, this will help the plant....when I water I water until it runs out of the bottom, making sure to let it drain well and not leave any water in the saucer, since many plants do not like their feet wet
Hope this helps

<TEXT> The Fact alone that 4 BILLION DOLLARS was spent on the Mid-term elections should be a wake-up call to everyone.  Just think about what that money could have done to make our country a better place to live!
Public funding only for campaigns really needs to happen.  Our representatives don't spend very much time working for us at all.  They are out fundraising most of the time.  I read somewhere recently that they usually are in Washington 2 days a week tops. </TEXT>

Hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have figured up how much it costs us for mortgage and utilities.  Me and my boyfriend each put $200 in our joint account a week.  Our expenses are about $1200 a month so we have extra in there for home maintenance, a snowblower, lawn mower, etc.  We each pay our own car insurance, cell phones, and 1/2 of the food...keeps things simple, I only write 3 checks a month from the joint account and all the bills are paid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read to your kids alot....as soon as they are 3 or so, start reading chapter books, like just one chapter each night... choose classics like Charlottes Web.  It will give them a love for reading when they learn that  not every story ends in 15-30 minutes...and kids who love to read are smarter, because they learn so much </TEXT>
