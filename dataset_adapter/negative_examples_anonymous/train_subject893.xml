<TEXT> Married no-name CFO of a big name company (conde nast I believe) allegedly tries to have closeted gay sex with a hooker. Plan foiled because plane is delayed. The story was absolutely terrible for a couple reasons, A) gawker's only proof that any of this happened was an "anonymous source," and B) the guy isn't even famous so why write a tabloid article about him? 

Basically imagine you, a random dude, are married with kids and your local newspaper decides to write a slanderous and baseless story about you and gay hookers. That's what gawker did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that's thing, women *can* do that. They werent allowed to be in combat positions. In the event of a draft most of the draftees are getting tossed into the infantry, cavalry, whatever, whereas the guys that enlist get to pick their position. Even though women have been allowed to try out for infantry positions for a year or two now (maybe longer?) I haven't heard of a single woman passing the  physical aspects of the officers test or ranger school (which is not to be confused with RASP which let's you join the 75th). Logistically it just doesn't make sense to draft women if 90+% of them aren't even physically capable of being in the infantry. Sure you can make the argument that you're making, but realistically speaking every time we've instituted a war time draft we were tossing draftees into fighting positions and not logistical positions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Airports/airplanes are a threat because an airplane can be used against a hard target like a building. If someone wanted to take out a soft target in the manner that you're talking about it would be easier for them to sneak past some guards at a sporting event or hit a crowded tourist attraction. The anti-TSA circlejerk is a bit ridiculous. Sure they're not as effective as they could be, but even security lines at major airports are less crowded than a lot of public attractions in big cities. When it comes to airports the government is mostly worried about somebody stealing  a plane because to date the two most devastating attacks on US soil have been from people crashing planes into things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Afghanistan was about undermining the Taliban's control over rural regions through a hearts and minds campaign. It was NEVER about poppies or opium. Most of the time the top brass actively discouraged burning down the poppy fields, and at least one base even went so far as to let a farmer use their sewage run off as irrigation for his poppy fields. The reason being that destroying an entire village's livelihood is going to do more to make them support the taliban than to win over their hearts and minds. 

Suppress the mitigating factor and of course poppy cultivation flourishes, but it's not because the US government was trying to get in on the afghani poppy trade. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where did you get the idea that it "just happens?" Yes, a common-law marriage is easier to form than a traditional marriage but it requires both parties to act as if they are married by introducing each other as husband or wife, filing joint tax returns, combining assets and debts, and just generally doing what married people do. In recent years common law marriage was mostly used as a get around in states that didn't allow gay marriage. Are you really trying to tell me that anybody that's been roommates with someone for more than "x" years is automatically in a legal and binding relationship with them? It's not that simple. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do you think that? Like I'm not trying to be a dick to you, I'm legitimately curious about why so many people on reddit realistically think he has a chance. Here's why I'm not so sure he does:

  Bernie is running on a campaign that promises free college, $15/hr minimum wage, cheap healthcare, and an increased amount of days off. Don't get me wrong that all sounds great, but there's absolutely nothing to suggest that any of that is feasible. Obama ran on a similar platform and didn't do any of it. He'll get roadblocked every step of the way, and he hasn't actually suggested much that he could reasonably achieve. On top of that he has absolutely no experience in foreign policy or diplomatic relations and has little experience dealing with minority problems and no experience dealing with border issues. The polling in his favor is done rather optimistically. The polls that show him gaining on hillary were done in his state, which has a 95% white population, is predominantly middle class, and has a population smaller than most large cities, or in other New English states with similar demographics. Finally, he's a self described socialist which is not going to fly in a lot of red and purple states. I doubt I'm going to view him as a realistic candidate until he shows polling promise in states in the midwest and west. 

But if you have a reason to believe that he is a realistic candidate other than his ability to connect with people then please tell me. Bernie's ideas are good in theory and if he could honestly pull them off I'd probably vote for him, but I would rather have a dem candidate that's realistic than a democratic party that's divided and a Republican party that's rallying behind one guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What? If anything this promotes debate rather than further secret negotiations. The full bill has to be publicly disclosed (I believe at least for two months before congress votes on it), and Congress can't amend it so they either have to pass it or nix it. If there's any discrepancy in TPP you'll have plenty of time to write your representative and tell them to vote against it. Furthermore I don't understand why you people keep harping on the secret negotiations aspect of it. Classified negotiations are par for the course with any FTA because it makes reaching a deal simpler. Hell it's par for the course for non-FTA bills, even Obamacare was negotiated in secret. There's literally no reason to go all conspiro about this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The term "poor door" is kind of misleading. The city needs low income housing so apartments built low income housing, with the caveat that the people that are paying a reduced price not have access to many of the building's amenities that the majority of tenants are paying market value for. Poor doors open into a section of the building that is physically separated from the pool, gym, etc. It's not about degrading poor people. 

The reality is that this ruling will make more property managers resistant to having low income housing in their buildings, which is really a shame because these programs allow lower class families to live in safer neighborhoods with better schools. It's not unreasonable for building managers to want to charge market value if their tenants are going to be able to use the door man and the pool and the gym and all of those rather expensive amenities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's because 90% of the American public has no understanding of basic economics and gets lost in the first paragraph of any TPP article. If you go to any business or economic centric news outlet (WSJ, Bloomberg, The Economist, etc) they are all talking about the TPP. As an informed person you are supposed to diversify your news sources. ABC, CNN, HuffPo, etc none of them hire experts, they hire *journalists*, so all the TPP stuff they write is like a crude ELI5.  Honestly you shouldn't be trying to get specialized news like science or economics from a major news outlet like CNN because those outlets are primarily equipped to report on things like politics and war because anyone with any type of degree can understand it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meth is still a prescription drug, trade name desoxyn. The problem with meth is that it binds to a protein that makes it neurotoxic even at low doses. That's why doctors are willing to prescribe high doses of dextroamphetamine before they prescribe even low dose methamphetamine. A study comparing long term meth and cocaine use found that a 6 day exposure to meth causes neurotoxicity, but cocaine was not neurotoxic at 11 days. Neither of them are safe but if I had a gun to my head I'd take the coke over the meth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wheel recommendations for the tugboat? I took the 66mm zig zags that came with it and put them on my Land Shark bc I felt that they fit that wheel base better. I've found that the tug's wheel base feels a bit too small for me so I'm thinking smaller wheels might fix that problem. Want to try that before I go through the trouble of selling it.

<TEXT> Because marijuana doesn't actually cure anything. It alleviates symptoms. Stoner "activists" act like a couple puffs off a joint is enough to cure cancer but there is absolutely zero evidence that marijuana does anything but alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the legalization of marijuana, both recreational and medical, but people need to be realistic about the situation. It's not a miracle drug. So far there's no scientific evidence that points towards it being anything other than a potent painkiller and seizure drug. Acting like it's a miracle drug is only going to hurt the case for legalization when actual scientific papers come out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right but bankers are involved in finance and not the creation of goods. Inflation is the elevation of the prices of goods and services. It's realistic to think that companies will raise the prices of their goods to account for the increased production costs. That 28m figure is only for federal minimum wage workers. It doesn't include anyone making 7.26/hr or higher. 29 states have a minimum wage higher than 7.25/hr. I agree that people should be realistic about the pros   cons, it's not going to kill the economy if the minimum is raised to $15 but there will be consequences. I imagine that unemployment will go up quite a bit until the economy is strong enough to re-absorb those workers. </TEXT>

I was just looking at the tracking information for my latest muirskate order and saw that they're using OnTrac and not UPS or FedEx. I hadn't heard of them so I googled the carrier service and apparently 97% of their reviews on BBB are negative.... Anyone know why/when muir switched over? If I'm remembering correctly I think they used UPS last time I ordered something from them which was like 6mo ago. 

When I get my stuff I'll update about whether it was on time and arrived safely </TEXT>

In Judaism they essentially believe that muslims and christians worship the same god but only the jews accepted the Torah. They believe that everyone should follow the 7 commandments, but there are certain things from the Torah that are only a sin if committed by a Jew. They don't look down on others so much as they hold themselves to a higher standard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm following Diplo on snapchat and on his story he played a version of lean on that sounded just plain dirty. It was amazing. The first time I heard it on his snap was a few weeks ago when he posted a video of his son dancing to it, and the second time was later that day at what appeared to be a show. The thing that stood out to me most was the bit that starts at 00:49 in the original version but it was louder, faster, and had more bass in this mix.  I've listened to all the remixes on soundcloud and none of them sound right, pls help!!!!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Set up an E*Trade account or an account with another discount broker. Do some research and see what suits your needs. Pay attention to their fees. Make sure you understand how much their transaction fees are and whether they charge you for both buying and selling or just one or the other. When you set up the account and they ask you how you want your money to be stored when it's not invested in a stock you want to go with a sweep account so that it incurs interest even when you're not investing. 

If you want to invest in a mutual fund that's fine it's a relatively low risk way to do things but mutual funds are usually diversified to the point that they don't offer high returns so definitely make sure you look into the fund's historic returns. 

Another way to invest is to put your money into a Roth IRA which is a form of retirement account. The money is taxed when you put it into the account so there's no penalty if you liquidate the account before retirement. The returns are going to be higher than what a standard savings account will give you but they're not going to be crazy. I think the current return on a Roth IRA is like 8% so if you put in 4-5k and let it sit for a year you're going to earn somewhere between 300-400. So nothing crazy but for not having to do any work other than deposit some money it's not bad. A Roth IRA is the safest type of short term investment I can think of so if you don't want to risk losing money this is the way to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at 240-250 when I got my first board. I got a tugboat which held my weight fine but it's not really a true longboard and it might be too short for your height. The main thing at weights above ~200 is you want to look for a board that's not designed to have flex because those are designed to have flex for someone that weighs 130-160. 

Daddies Boardshop has a section of boards designed for heavier riders:

http://www.daddiesboardshop.com/longboards/230lbs-and-up

Also look into the Bustin Ibach and the Maestro Mini.

That Modela should hold you fine. The main thing is to just stay away from super flexy cruisers and penny boards.

Also good job getting in shape brah! I was where you are not too long ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Landyachtz dinghy is really good, as is the tugboat which is just a slightly wider version with a slightly longer kick. 

Normally I wouldn't advocate for a Santa Cruz board because they're usually not that great but I actually think that the SC Landshark is a really good mini cruiser. I have one that I use to get around at my college and a lot of my friends use them. We like them because for a ~27-28" board they have a pretty long wheel base and the kick is functional for pivot turns, though you're probably not going to be able to ollie with it. Amazing if you need a compact and lightweight commuter, not so great if you want to do anything else.

Arbor also makes a few cruisers. They just dropped a new one called the Rally which is 30" long and comes with reverse king pin trucks which tend to be pretty carvy. The other two are the pilsner (31") and the pocket rocket which is really short, I want to say it's like 25 or 26 inches. </TEXT>

So far I've got about 4 or 5 months of experience on a mini cruiser. Bustin is saying I should put 78a bustin premiers on it. I've narrowed it down to those and Sector 9 78a topshelf 9 balls, Sector 9 butterballs, and 80a 69mm arbor vice wheels.

<TEXT> What would you say the max rider weight for the Maestro is? I've been fluxuating around 180-190 recently and I'm worried that it may have a bit too much flex. Also for wheels  I was originally thinking  Kegels but 80mm might be too big, so 70mm 78a bustin premiers, 75mm 80a orangatang durians, 69mm 80a orangatang cages, or 70mm 86a orangatang stimulus? 

I want to order everything off bustin's site for simplicity's sake and because it's slightly cheaper than muirskate but I guess I'm not opposed to getting the deck and trucks from bustin and the wheels and bearings (zealous rather than bustin abec7s) from muirskate if you guys have a better idea for wheels.

This'll be my third board but first true longboard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watch the video a few more times. And pay attention to the moments right before the shooting. The kid stares at the officer for a good three seconds then says "nah fool" and lifts up his shirt and has his hand near his belt buckle in a manner that resembles that of a pistol being removed from a waistband, Yeah, the cop was too quick to draw but in this case it's not as simple as the cop executing an innocent kid for no reason. The kid has previously had suicidal tendencies, it's a very real possibility that he knew what he was doing. </TEXT>

Edit: Just checked the guide and saw that you're talking about nuts and washers and screws. If you're looking for speed rings for your wheels I doubt they'll have those, but they should definitely have the other stuff. Just make sure to either figure out what diameter and length screws you need ahead of time or bring your setup so you can ask them for help. </TEXT>

Your first statement made me think that you didn't fully know what a partner is. Maybe you can see why in the context of the conversation I thought that. Maybe I read your comment wrong. 

You: 

I never said that the higher ups, like partners, arent paid that much...

Me:

 The partners they're talking about are not equity partners, but rather salaried partners which are essentially just senior staff members.

You:

Why do you keep assuming I dont know this shit? ... you think I don't what a salaried partner is

But whatever bro I'm done because this conversation is leading nowhere and you're being a bit of a jerk. I'm sorry I came across as condescending but education is a part of any argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well now you're just being an asshole but I see where the misunderstanding is coming from. It sounds like you don't fully understand the terminology of corporate America. Partner =/= to owner or executive. The partners they're talking about are not equity partners, but rather salaried partners which are essentially just senior staff members. When it comes to law firms and investing firms all roads lead to partner and if you don't get there you fucked up somewhere along the line. If we're still discussing the original topic, which was whether the average GS investment banker eventually breaks seven figs, then the link is correct. From your comment I gather that what you believe is that making partner is to finance as getting a managerial or rare promotion is to other fields. In investing it's essentially a title given to employees that have made it past the probationary (analyst) and junior (associate) phases of employment. Think of it not as a title for a department head with the same powers as the owner or equity partners, but as a title for a project leader that answers to the equity partners. They head up a team of analysts and associates to facilitate IPOs, mergers, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bonus is just something they get. It's not guarunteed, but there's an expectation that they'll get it. The commission (.1-7% depending on project) is written into their contract. They're seperate things. Think of the bonus a sort of pat on the back for getting through the year without burning out and the commission as an earned augmentation of their salary that's guarunteed if they complete a deal.

http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/salary/investment-banking-compensation

An analyst is hired fresh out of undergrad, an associate is someone that is either promoted from an analyst position or hired from an MBA program. They have more power but they're still doing grunt work. After a bit associates are either promoted to managing director (investment banker), to vp of a dept, or they decide investment banking hours are retardedly long and they make the transition to brokerage or hedge management. The pay range for all those positions including bonuses and commission is in that link. Bare in mind that GS is one of the most lucrative firms in the world so their employees' earnings will be on the high end of those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But again that's before commission. Obviously wall st as a whole does not average seven figure earnings but within the  premise of this thread we'retalking about investment bankers because the dead guy was an IB analyst. Investment bankers are the rockstars of wall st. A single IB can bring in more money each year than a high traffic brick and mortar branch of the bank. Investment bankers at top firms do usually take home seven figures *after commission* because they are the bank's top earners. When looking at how much people in finance make you have to look at the commission because that's usually the main source of income for bankers and brokers.  The base salary is just a contingency for if the market crashes.

But now picture the investment banker: he sells companies for millions, hundreds of millions, or even billions of dollars.

Deals worth less than $1 billion might come with a 1% commission, while deals worth more than that will scale down to around 0.1%.

But even 0.1% of $50 billion is $50 million.

So thats part 1 of why investment bankers make so much money: high-priced items with high commissions.

<TEXT> Because they're wrong and slightly deceptive. You can't honestly believe that a VP of any dept at one of the largest banks in the world is pulling less than 200k can you? That's ridiculous..... Anyone in the industry will tell you that's horseshit. The analyst figure is deceptive. Base salary ranges from 65-90k a year, but the industry standard is to also give them an annual bonus that's usually 70-100% of their salary, so even if their base salary is only 65k realistically they're making no less than 110k a year. A top performing recruit from an ivy school might make 180k their first year. After you get bumped up to a full IB position you might make anywhere from 100-250k base plus the yearly bonus plus 7% commission on every project you head up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because cops make a habit of killing people for their shoes? How about I give you a reality check. There are upwards of 14,000 civilian-on-civilian murders every year in this country. In Chicago 80% of murders are gang related. I have to imagine the stat is similar in some parts of LA. By comparison there are usually about 400 police shootings on average each year. Your line of thinking is the result of a profit driven agenda because the news has realized that cop shootings get people riled up. Couple that with the extreme bias and echo chamber effect of reddit and you've got a bunch of people acting on emotions rather than logic. If murders made the news at the samerate that police shootings do and you reacted the same way you'd think the US is a war zone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right but reddit seems to  believe that a false rape accusation is somehow more life ruining than any other felony. And a shocking number of people on this website express that they fully expect either themself or someone they know to be falsely accused and convicted of rape at some point. The reality is that out of every 100 rapes 32 are reported and of those only 2 lead to a conviction. It is one of the most underreported felonies in the US and it has one of the lowest conviction rates of any major crime. 

The reality is that maybe 7% of rapes make it to trial and only 2% of rapists are convicted. The likelihood of a false rape accusation getting far enough to make the news is so low that it's almost funny how big of an issue reddit seems to think false rape accusations are. Most real accusations don't get that far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've still got love for Aoki. He went to my school, UCSB, and lived in a sort of multicultural hippie commune thing while he was there. UCSB is a big party school with a decent EDM scene and word is that he initially started making a name for himself by DJing parties out here. UCSB is a pretty good school too so that's why he sounds so... literate in his article about himself. I also heard that even though his dad owns the benihana fortune they cut him off when he became an adult with the exception of paying for college. </TEXT>

Tbh I wouldn't even say that. My guess is that most police shootings occur either in areas that border mexico/southern florida or large cities like Oakland, LA, NYC, Detroit, etc  which for certain socioeconomic reasons have more violent organized crime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't dv you but I'll bite. I think neon future has two distinct styles, two upbeat mood songs (I Love it When You Cry and Home We'll Go) and an outlier (Youth Dem Turn Up, not a big fan tbh). The first style is hoise but has some sort of trancy elements and includes Heaven On Earth and Light Years. The second style is closer to what you'd expect from Aoki, deep repetitive bass hits, fast, the type of shit you rage to, Hysteria and Lightning Strikes. Then there's Darker Than Blood which is another one of his linkin park collabs and I've never really known what to make of those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The news is not supposed to be feel goodery time. It's supposed to be news.

This line of thinking is a product of the invention of the 24 hour news cycle. The news isn't supposed to make you feel any particular way. It can make you feel good, like if a cure for cancer was discovered, or it can make you feel bad like after 9/11, but the idea that you need hard hitting stories all the time kills the importance of actual news. The fact of the matter is that what most people think are hard hitting stories wouldn't even make the second page if news was actually filtered rather than posted one story after another in rapid succession only to be forgotten by the public domain in a matter of hours. 

Everything you just wrote from the first word reeks of brainwashing by a news cycle with an agenda. Do cops need to be held accountable? Sure. Is there any evidence that these so called "executions" are increasing in frequency or that there's an epidemic of police killing people? Absolutely not. It's just the latest in a long line of things that gets the public's attention so that's what the media is catering to. A few years ago it was school shootings, before that it was terrorism, before that drugs. 

I'm not a conspiracy theorist I don't believe that the media is evil, but it is profit driven so it has an agenda. Once you understand that and filter out overhyped stories accordingly you will understand the reality of the situation. The reality of this particular situation is that recently any police shooting from every town in the US that isn't 100% cut and dry is plastered on the front page of every major news outlet. If you were as quick to form a conclusion with everything as you are with this issue then within a week I could do the same thing and have you believing that every suburban white boy is destined to become a rapist, but you wouldn't believe that because it's not a rational line of thought. But for whatever reason a good chunk of the American public has decided to forego their critical thinking skills when it comes to this particular issue.

<TEXT>  So 110/100,000 FTE is possible.

No it's not. In mathematics and statistics when people say rate they almost always mean %. When talking about losing a physical object, ie a person, you cant have a rate that's greater than 100% because ot means that youve lost more of them than physically exist. A 110% fatality rate means that for every 100k workers 110k of them die. 110 deaths per capita, yes, that's possible but that's already listed on the left column so it doesn't make sense for them to put it in the rightmost column under rates.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-violent-crime-1970s-level-20141110-story.html

There's an article confirming the violent crime rate. We're currently at 1978 levels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That stat on crime rate was just for violent crime so any affect the introduction of any new drug laws had on that crime rate is indirect at best. The data you linked is compiled weirdly. They've got a profession with a 110 fatality rate which is simply not possible. My hunch is that the software they used didn't account for the # of workers column standing for X thousands so the raw data is actually the least accurate way of looking at it. The graph in the article I linked was based off of the BLS data you linked but they normalized the fatality rates. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You're arguing what ifs. The statistics say that being a LEO is one of the least lethal careers a person can choose. Hell an officer worker has a higher fatality rate/hour worked than a LEO does.

Utter, utter, utter, bullshit. This statement is categorically false no matter which way you look at it. [Law enforcement is the 15th most dangerous career in the US based on deaths per 100k workers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/28/charted-the-20-deadliest-jobs-in-america/). The only reason law enforcement isn't in the top 5 is because LE agencies take precautions to protect their officers like having them work in pairs, giving them EMS training and combat training, and giving them protective clothing. You'll notice that almost every single profession that's more dangerous than law enforcement (notice that no office work is included on that list) is in a field where time is money so managers are more likely to try to skirt safety requirements so that they can increase their profits. LEOs are also unionized so they have someone that advocates for more safety precautions. 

 Society is not violent. In fact society is becoming less violent each day that passes. The only area where violence is increasing is violence committed by LEOs.

Again this is bullshit. In the United States there is:

* A murder every 35.6 minutes

* A forcible rape every 6.2 minutes

* A robbery every 1.4 minutes

* An aggravated assault every 40.5 seconds

* A burglery every 14.6 seconds

The crime rate may be going down but that just means we are in a transitional period. Today's world is very much a violent one. Gangs in LA, Baltimore, NYC, and Detroit initiate middle and [high schoolers](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-03-12/news/bal-md.ci.arrest12mar12_1_gang-initiation-gang-member-bloods) by having them kill someone, a stranger, a cop, [a friend, these people don't give a fuck. They are animals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_PtJwNu3Q) Don't pretend that we live in a safe world. Don't try to downplay the danger involved in police work because statistically it is more dangerous than firefighting. And don't kid yourself about the crime rate going down. Yes, it's low compared to recent years but that's because the crime rate shot up during the crack epidemic. The current crime rate is still higher than it was in 1970. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well according to ODMP.org, in 2014, if we exclude K9s, there were 47 line of duty deaths by gunfire, 10 by vehicular assault, and 2 by assault. And according to OPs article so far there have been more than usual this year, but usually about 400 people are killed by officers each year. Obviously this is by no means a perfect way of measuring this but the ratio of cops killed to criminals killed by cops in 2014 is 59:~400 so 1:6.78. When you consider that cops are trained and criminals usally have no formal weapons or combat training it seems like 6.7 criminals killed for every 1 cop killed is a reasonable statistic. Especially considering the FBI estimates that there were 14,196 murders in 2013. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not always possible to restrain them. In fact I would say that in the case of most police shootings it was not possible to restrain them. Your use of the word execute sort of implies that you believe that when a cop kills someone they are choosing to be judge jury and executioner, and not simply defending themselves. You are wrong.

<TEXT> But why do you think that is? Perhaps it's because police departments take precautions to protect their officers, all are given guns, generally work in pairs, backup is usually nearby, bullet proof vests, etc and police are unionized so they have people advocating for them.

[Here's the list of the most danferous jobs in the US](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/28/charted-the-20-deadliest-jobs-in-america/). Police officers still make the top 20 ahead of fire fighters soeven with all those precautions their job is dangerous. The jobs ahead of them are things like fishing, electrical work, logging, and construction. If you've ever met anyone in those professions they'll tell you that things are made dangerous by bosses that want to keep costs down by skirting safety precautions. 

Also I think just measuring by deaths per 100k is a poor metric because who's more likely to be stuck with a used needle and contract a disease? Or hit by a car and paralyzed? Or get PTSD, or depression, or alcoholism, or any of the other mental illnesses that have a higher prevalence among cops than the gen population?

<TEXT> Damn you're really desperate to believe that this guy is innocent. Nobody persuaded DPR to use a hitman. Nobody even suggested it or alluded to it until he did, ergo nobody entrapped him into committing conspiracy to commit attempted murder in the first-degree. Furthermore, they were blackmailing him by threatening to reveal the identities of SR users which is not illegal, especially because SR at its core is an illegal operation. None of the circumstances would be considered an attempt at entrapment. On top of that none of these guys have been confirmed to be DEA agents, the whole theory that they are DEA agents was created by DPR's supporters. From a legal standpoint if the people he attempted to hit are in fact DEA agents it still wouldn't be considered entrapment because having them murdered was his idea and his idea only. At one point the person he was talking to in that chat log asked if there's another way to resolve the problem because murder draws too much attention and DPR maintained that murder was the only solution. </TEXT>

**Redandwhite 4/1/2013 22:06:** Your problem has been taken care of. They seized a bunch of stuff he had with him at the time as well. They said he had a couple laptops and a bunch of usb sticks. Is there anything of that, that belongs to you? They questioned him and he spilled everything he knew. He said that he and Xin were actually working together on this scheme to blackmail you and that they were brought in by a 3rd guy who has been selling on here for a couple years who is a scam artist. Apparently he makes selling accounts, sells for a while and then pulls a big scam and he just keeps creating new accounts after he does his scams. They got that guys name also , I will give that to you free of charge when I meet them to get the picture and computer hardware they got. Rest easy though, because he wont be blackmailing anyone again. Ever.

**Dread Pirate Roberts 4/2/2013 00:55:** Excellent work. Please send any info you can get on this third party along with the picture. The picture can be uploaded here: ------I've removed the link for the sake of the reddit post but it's still in the transcript------
I have no need for any of his possessions, so you can do what you want with that stuff.
Thank you again for your assistance,

<TEXT> He was talking about using a hitman before anyone was threatening his safety. Have you read the [transcripts](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/read-transcript-silk-roads-boss-ordering-5-assassinations/)? He doesn't come across as someone that's being coerced, in fact he was the one that suggested using a hitman.

**Dread Pirate Roberts 3/27/2013 23:38:** In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldnt mind if he was executed, but then youd be out your $700k. I dont think he is going to come up with the money because he seems very desperate.

Then later when they're negotiating the price he mentions that he has already used a hitman before

**Dread Pirate Roberts 3/31/2013 8:59 :** Dont want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k. Are the prices you quoted the best you can do?

He's not someone that I feel particularly sorry for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First degree murder carries a minimum of life in prison under federal jurisdiction.

Six counts of attempted first degree murder is definitely enough to warrant life in prison. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Entrapment is different than what you appear to believe it to be. Entrapment requires the officer to persuade the suspect into doing something that they otherwise wouldn't do, IE if an undercover cop came up to you and asked you to sell them drugs and you said yes that's not entrapment, but if the continued pressing until you eventually agree then that is entrapment. Creating a problem and then stepping in when he decides that he needs a very violent solution is not entrapment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The kind of people that are executives of fortune 500 companies have an ungodly work ethic, are near geniuses, and can somehow work 15-20 hours a day 7 days a week without going insane or burning out. You can replace a cashier, a customer service rep, a salesman in an instant, you can replace an IT guy in a day, a middle manager in a week, a wall st broker in two weeks, but finding someone that has the education, intelligence, work ethic, experience, and mental fortitude that it takes to run a fortune 500 company is damn near impossible. It's easy to find someone with one of those traits, but probably one in a million people have all of them. The job market is all about supply and demand. The supply of unskilled laborers far outweighs the demand, the supply of college educated laborers slightly outweighs the demand. The demand for someone qualified to run a fortune 500 company far far far outweighs the supply so they are very expensive. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I mentioned to my dad that I'm planning on selling my single speed road bike before I come home from college and he asked me not to because he wants to start cycling casually to go to work and get in better shape. The problem is the guy is getting up there and I think the geometry of my bike might be a bit too aggressive for his back. I was thinking I should get him a comfort style bike and I was originally looking at the Giant Cypress but it's just a bit too far out of my price range. If I need to I'll shell out the extra $50 but if there's anything I can get in the sub three hundred price range that's better I'd like to know. 

Are any of these good?

<TEXT> Bro anything can work to lose weight as long as you cut calories. I've lost 50lbs from a diet consisting mostly of burritos burgers and sandwiches. The key is to find the best way to spread the calories out over the course of the day that won't leave you snacking. For me I can't do the whole three 500 calorie meals thing because it leaves me feeling hungry when I try to sleep, so what I do is have maybe a snack around lunch and then I eat a 1000-1300 calorie dinner. </TEXT>

Running at your weight is going to give you some gnarly shin splints at the very least and that will only serve to give you an excuse to take 2 week breaks so they can recover.

<TEXT> Alright well lets pick apart this video.

1) Right off the bat the lady in the video starts describing why boys have trouble in school. She says that they are "Boys tend to be disorganized and restless, some have even been known to be noisy and hard to manage." 

Now her description of what a "typical boy" is like is a bit weird, idk where you went to school but I had friends that were guys that were completely organized, and I had friends that were a bit messy. Same goes for girls, but the interesting part is the "some can even be noisy and hard to manage" bit. What she's describing there sounds like ADHD, not "typical boy" behaviour. Boys are [three times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD compared to girls](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/features/adhd-symptoms-in-girls-and-boys). 

2) Then she quotes a psychologist, Michael Thompson, he says "Girl behaviour is the gold standard in school, boys are treated like defective girls." Now I tried to google this Michael Thompson, after a bit of effort I found his website. He has a PhD in... something, I'm assuming psychology. The problem is that in the bio section of his website he makes no mention of where he got his undergrad, where he got his phd, etc. According to his website hes really more of an author because he has never been involved in clinical psychology, and he references no studies to back up his claim, effectively making it an unfounded opinion.

3) She then goes on to explain that boys score lower than girls on national reading exams. I have a serious problem with this claim because she provides no source to back it up and after 15 minutes of googling I can't find anything to support it.

4) She then goes on to cite isolated incidents regarding zero tolerance in schools ~ irrelevent.

5) Every following argument is rooted in broad generalizations about boys.

This video makes a lot of big claims without backing a single thing up with evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My guess is that if I looked through your post history I would find posts in /r/mensrights and /r/theredpill. Those are both what psychologists like to call, [echo chambers](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29), and they are very unhealthy things to spend extended periods of time in without examining opposing view points and comparing them to your own beliefs.

In the words of the philosopher and mathematician William K. Clifford:

If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing it -- the life of that man is one long sin against mankind </TEXT>

<TEXT> A SEAL team arrives late in the night at the camp where these scumbags live. They slowly make their way through the camp slitting the throats of the guards and the sleeping soldiers. As they grow closer to the scumbags they go loud so that the fear and the anxiety grows within them as the SEALs inch closer. Gunfire and shouting is all they hear as it dawns on them that some of the most elite fighters in the world are coming for them. The SEAL team finally reaches them and forces them to look at the bloodshed around them. The scumbags flinch everytime one of the SEALs moves their gun. But to the SEALs death is too humane of a way to go for these men, as is anything that the US government would permit them to do, and that's saying something. The SEALs decide to hand them off to one of our more... controversial allies. The Israelis. The Israelis in turn give them to Mossad telling them to do what they wish. After Mossad is done extracting information from them in the most inhumane and excruciating ways possible they decide it's time to kill them. No ordinary execution is enough though. Mossad decides to shackle each of their limbs to a 100lb cement block and leave them in the desert near the Israeli-Palestinian border, but before leaving them there they attach a large saline drip to each of them so that they'll survive the dehydration, at least for awhile. The men then spend their last days wondering what will finally kill them, the sun? a scorpion? A stray Hamas rocket? Starvation? Will they outlast the saline drip and spend their last hours in a state of dehydration induced delirium? Who knows, but it will be a slow death and that is fine by the rest of the world.  </TEXT>

They would seperate a set of twins and keep them in separate cells, then they would inject them with various chemicals and inject dyes into their eyes just to see if they would react the same. They would also sewed together twins to try to turn them into conjoined twins... it was some human centipede type shit. They also used jews as lab rats for testing various desalination methods, experiment nerve and bone transplant surgeries, and to test new forms of medicine and first aid they would infect jews with various lethal diseases and then try different ways to cure them or they would inflict phosphorus burns on them so they could try to treat them.

It's not rap, it's not rock, it's not pop, it doesn't really fit into any conventional genre. Same with [Lost in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyQpQhrQ5Zs) (NSFW album cover), yeah it's got rap in it but it's not really a rap song.

<TEXT> what's the grounds for federal jurisdiction of any kind?

[The civil rights act of 1964](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime_laws_in_the_United_States)

Although state laws vary, current statutes permit federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's protected characteristics of **race**, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.

Considering the geographic location of Mississipi and its history of racism if this isn't a suicide then it's a hate crime. Local law enforcement agencies in southern states do not have a good reputation when it comes to investigating and prosecuting hate crimes so it's best that the FBI handles the entirety of the case.

<TEXT> No they shouldn't. This is perfectly legal. The civil rights act of 1964 gave the FBI authority to investigate any racially motivated crime against anyone attempting to perform one of six federally protected activities. A 2009 amendment signed into law by Obama removed the prerequisite that the victim had to be engaging in a federally protected activity for the FBI to get involved. Considering the culture of a place like Mississippi it is better for the FBI to be on scene from the get go before evidence is tampered with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with that is that there's no way to reliably account for something like that. You can say X% of companies go under due to fraud or other out of market forces but there's no way to say which companies will do that. From an investing standpoint the chances that you'll pick a fraudulent blue chip company are too low to justify the lowered rates of ROI from diversifying beyond 25-30 stocks. It's not possible to invest with meaningful returns without risk. obviously there's no reason to start spending significant amounts of money buying up penny stocks, but within reason higher risk=higher potential returns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> but there comes a point when adding more stocks to your portfolio ceases to make a difference. There is a debate over how many stocks are needed to reduce risk while maintaining a high return. The most conventional view argues that an investor can achieve optimal diversification with only 15 to 20 stocks spread across various industries.

<TEXT> August Busch the 4th. He was handed the CEO-ship of Anheuser-Busch and arguably ran the company into the ground.

He wasnt just "handed" the company. He had worked in various positions for nearly 20 years (1989-2006) before he was selected by the then president (who was not a member of the busch family) to be his successor. Your idea that he ran the business into the ground is a bit odd. Yes, he was unable to hold onto the business but he sold it for $20/share above wjat the record highest share value of the company was, so it's not like he lost his family or shareholders any money. If anything they turned a significant profit.

Ivy level education: 

Cheating is prevalent at any university, whether it's through the use of amphetamines or through collaboration on take home exams. Grade inflation is an interesting topic when you're talking anout Ivy schools and it certainly needs to be addressed, but the fact remains that even getting into an Ivy school is a feat of it's own. Nobody going to harvard can be called lazy or stupid. 

MBA programs: 

If you're not attending a top 15 MBA program then you shouldnt be paying for an MBA program. Every top ranked MBA program (with the exception of harvard iirc) requires that you have at least 4 years of experience prior to enrollment. Eneolling in any old MBA program because  "that's just what you do" isnt going to help you. The type of people that can get into a good MBA program are destined to be execs of large companies, so attending a program like that essentially gives them 5-10 years of experience worth of management knowledge in 3-4 years. It also lets you network with other future execs. Any old MBA program won't do that for you.

 Holding individual stocks is more akin to gambling than investing

Not really. If you have 16 blue chip stocks in various unrelated industries then safety wise your portfolio is as diverse as one that has 50 stocks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mdma is a weird drug. It's not a stimulant in the same sense that coke and other amphetamines are stimulants. If you're taking real MDMA and you're not taking anything that'll interact with it then it shouldn't feel speedy or edgy or anything like that. You start out feeling a rush but then that sort of goes away and you start "peaking" which makes you feel euphoric and happy. The come down can be kind of rough but that can be mitigated with various vitamins and supplement. A lot of people get an "after glow" ranging from a few days to a few weeks that can make you feel happier and more empathetic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At that level nothing is just handed to you. Yes, some of them may have inherited the job but they still needed to complete an Ivy level education and most likely make it through a decent MBA program. Their dad wouldn't have given them the position if they were a failure. If you're unaware of what exactly a fortune 500 company is, it's a top 500 performing *public or closely held corporation*. No stock broker worth their salt is going to keep their clients money in the stock of a company that just made a coked out retard the CEO. And nobody with stock in a closely held corporation is going to let a coked out retard become the CEO. Blaming nepotism or cronyism for your own professional inadequacies is a cop out. Nobody is going to hire you for being average. If you want to work in the world of high level corporate america then you can't just sit on your ass through college, you need to get a kick ass GPA so you look good to recruiters, and you need to befriend as many people as possible because when you're talking about positions that can make or break a company people hire people that they know and can trust, not just people that look good on paper.

<TEXT> How do you guys feel about Santa Cruz boards? I got a land shark about a week ago and I love it. Kind of curious why I never see it recommended (as opposed to the Dinghy which seems to be the go to) here when people are asking for a small commuter board? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chronysim are a huge part of life. Lose that lottery and you're screwed.

*Cronyism isn't part of some lottery. Networking is just as important as school itself. If you're running some fortune 500 company are you going to hire the guy that looks slightly better on paper or are you going to hire the guy that looks good on paper AND that you know personally and can trust? People like you are part of the problem in this country. You didn't get ahead because you didn't play the game and now you're complaining that life is unfair because you weren't automatically rewarded for being average. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been to Hawaii a few times. You can get around the perimeter of the islands via bus usually but if you want to go anywhere specific you'll need a car. A good deal of Hawaii is still jungle so they don't really need to send buses everywhere. That said, I don't believe that there's any island-island public transpo so save some cash for a ferry if you think you'll want to go to other islands. </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by not buying new boxers after losing a significant amount of weight. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-10 08:24:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So over the course of my first year of college I've lost about 50 pounds which is amazing! What's even better is that the cute girls have started talking to me! However, while I've downsized my entire wardrobe I haven't bought new boxers because a lot of them still fit due to the elastic waistband. Well last thursday I was in a rush to get to class so I grabbed a random pair of boxers and threw on a pair of shorts and ran out the door. Now, this is key, my dorm is far enough from the main campus that people either ride bikes or take the bus to class. I decided to take the bus on this particular day. I take my seat and at the next stop a 10/10 sorority girl (Alpha Phi, yeah, this is serious business) sits down next to me. I mustered up some courage and decided to start talking to her. Surprisingly enough we hit it off and by the time we get to campus I'm making her laugh. Now this is wear the fuck up happens. When I sat down on the bus my boxers must have slid below my belt because the moment I step off the bus I feel them start slipping. What's even worse is that it turns out this girl is in the lecture I'm going to and we've still got a half a mile to walk. We walk a bit further and these things are going. I'm doing my best to hold on to them through my pocket without looking awkward as hell but it's not going well. We walk a bit further and that's when it happens, I lose control and now my boxers are just resting on the crotch of my shorts. I look down and you can see them hanging through the leg holes of my shorts. I look like some retarded gangster that's doing a reverse sag look. At this point I'm just praying this girl doesn't look down. 

This is when I luck out, I see a couple of my friends a ways away and I text both of them "911 need wingman asap." Now these guys are pros, they start walking over without hesitation, and when they get close enought see her aphi shirt they know that this isn't some joke. I gestured at my shorts and they leapt into action. They say what's up to me and introduce themselves to her and then distract her for just long enough for me to step behind her and reach into my pants and pull my boxers up. Now, to anyone else in the area this probably looked weird as fuck, but again this girl IS A MOTHER FUCKING ALPHA PHI, and desperation measures needed to be taken. I mean you show me a campus where aphis aren't the hottest girls. The wingman intervention was a successful and I sat next to her all through the lecture and I've got plans to hang out with her and some of her sisters this weekend. 

**TL;DR** boxers fell down so far they were visibly below my shorts while I was talking to a hot as fuck girl, friends intervened with a distraction, and I successfully fixed boxers and got girls number. </TEXT>

The difference between their dealers and dealers in the poorer neighborhoods is that their dealer is only once or twice removed from the trafficker. Whereas in the poorer neighborhoods the coke may have gone through 10 different dealers before it reaches the street level dealer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel you but at the same time there is a line. Take my roommate for example. He's on his PC from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed with a small break for school. He neglects taking care of himself, he showers maybe once every week or two, and he hasn't socialized with anyone irl besides me and the friends I bring home since the beginning of the school year. His only form of social interaction is when he's playing steam with his friends from high school. In some ways he's worse than a functional alcoholic. His mouse broke about a month ago and he literally went through withdrawals while he was waiting for a new one. And yet in his twisted little mind he thinks that what he's doing is morally superior and healthier than me going out and getting fucked up with my friends every weekend.

Yes you should respect other people's lifestyles, but at the same time denying that there's such a thing as too much computer time is wrong too.  </TEXT>

So enough that youve got a sizeable pledge class, but not so many that even if 20% of each class decides to live out you have to raffle out rooms. If you're rushing 20 pledges twice a year and you've only got 25 bedrooms you're going to have issues, even if you have a senior house.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said I supported prism, I don't. I do however, support international surveillance programs. And that's where he fucked up. I would support his actions 100% if he had only released information regarding prism and similar domestic surveillance programs, but he didn't. He foolishly decided to release **classified** information  regarding **legitimate** surveillance programs on political and military figures in nations like Russia and China and Pakistan. That is where he fucked up. As I said, a right doesn't excuse a wrong. There was no reason that he had to leak information about legitimate programs. You and the hivemind seem intent on ignoring half of the facts regarding his actions.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or they're realists that understand that you can be right and wrong at the same time. Stop sucking his dick and try to comprehend the fact that him exposing NSA spying on US citizens is NOT an excuse for leaking information about international surveillance programs. You are the epitome of the hivemind and it sickens me that people like you are so blinded by your own ideals that you can't understand that he majorly fucked up. Yes, he exposed a program that is infringing on our rights, but he also fucked up several legitimate programs. One does not excuse the other.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To say that he didn't commit espionage is a lie. American citizens can be charged with espionage against the US. There is precedent for it. And do you honestly believe that he didn't give Russia any of that information? How naive can you be? Russia isn't hosting him because they enjoy his company. Beyond that, an entity can be many things it does not have to be a country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That doesn't make it right, nor does it excuse him. Edward Snowden could've done what he did in such a way that it could legitimately be considered civil disobedience, but he leaked more than what was necessary for his cause. For that he is a traitor. There is no way to get around that. Edward Snowden is a traitor for leaking states secrets and then fleeing with that information to not one, but two countries that are in a quasi cold war with the western world. He fucked up. Simple as that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every force in the world worth their salt spies on each other. Every. Single. One. Russia spies on us, China spies on us, Israel spies on us, Pakistan spies on us, Iraq spies on us, Egypt spies on us, the list goes on. And we spy on them. It's how global diplomacy has worked since WW1. To think otherwise is foolish. To think that we shouldn't because we should set some kind of moral precedent is just plain stupid. For revealing the NSA spying on US citizens, maybe Snowden should be let off the hook. That's up to a judge and jury though. For royally fucking up global relations, and fucking the hell out of many of the CIA's legitimate surveillance programs he should face trial, and he should probably be convicted of treason and espionage. </TEXT>

Yes we should. It's  naive to think otherwise. The world isn't perfect and in this imperfect world exists weapons with the capability of leveling cities, states, even countries. It is imperative that we know what countries have what weapons, how stable their leadership is, and if they plan on using them. It's not a matter of morality. It's a matter of life and death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just going to copy and paste a response I used for another comment.

The problem is that he didn't just leak information regarding NSA spying on US citizens. If he did he might have a defense. He fucked up in a real bad way when he leaked information regarding US spying on foreign nations, which is legal under US law. Any "civil disobedience" defense he might have had went right out the window when he did that. When you expose classified info of surveillance programs designed to gather information about terrorists and hostile nations then you are, by the very definition of the word, a traitor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those are the definitions that have existed since the laws are written. Regardless of how you feel about Snowden, he did break the law. The criminal justice system in the United States is not based on the court of public opinion, nor should it be. Tell me, if you truly believe that he should be found innocent, what should his defense be? You can't say that he didn't do it. You can't say that he deserves an exception to the law. What is the reasoning behind your idea that he simply shouldn't be punished? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's talk about this for a second. The legal definition of civil disobedience:

A symbolic, non-violent violation of the law, done deliberately in protest against some form of perceived injustice. **Mere dissent, protest, or disobedience of the law does not qualify.** The act must be nonviolent, open and visible, illegal, performed for the moral purpose of protesting an injustice, and **done with the expectation of being punished.**

Like it or not, civil disobedience is not a get out of jail free card. Otherwise anybody could commit any nonviolent crime they want in the name of ending injustice and get away with it. Snowden and his supporters should have absolutely no expectation that he will get away scott free just because he did it in the name of justice.

Here's the definition of espionage in the US:

The act of securing information of a military or political nature that a competing nation holds secret. It can involve the analysis of diplomatic reports, publications, statistics, and broadcasts, as well as spying, a clandestine activity carried out by an individual or individuals working under secret identity to gather classified information on behalf of another entity or nation. In the United States, the organization that heads most activities dedicated to espionage is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

What Snowden did falls squarely into the definition of espionage against the United States of America. If he gets convicted it's not because he had an unfair trial. It is because he publicly committed treason and left a massive trail of evidence while doing it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have a roommate, I guess we will call him Matt. At first it seemed like I had lucked out with Matt, he brought a fridge, a microwave, and a few game systems. He mostly kept to himself and he was pretty quiet even when he was playing LoL with his friends from high school. He only played LoL in the common room too so it wasn't really a big deal. Well one day our suite mate invited some people over and they were hanging out in the living room so Matt asked me if he could play LoL in our room. I said whatever nbd. Fast forward two weeks and matt has pretty much stopped moving to the living room to play LoL (which he was doing more frequently at this point) and is basically only playing in our room. His volume is also increasing, he's laughing and yelling at his friends, making retarded nerd jokes, and getting angry when they're losing. His friend group is also completely dysfunctional so they're always arguing about some petty bullshit.  

Fast forward another three weeks and Matt still hasn't made any friends and frequently skips class for one reason or another so he is ALWAYS in our room. To top it off it turns out that Matt is a goddamn insomniac so after I tell him to shut up so I can sleep I still have to listen to him rapidly clicking his mouse (I once woke up to piss at 4 in the fucking morning and he was still just sitting at his desk playing LoL). He has also become loud to the point that on a nightly basis our neighbors or an RA is coming to our door to tell him to shut the fuck up. 

And if all that wasn't enough he has tossed personal hygiene to the wind. It's not uncommon for him to wear the same clothes for two weeks straight, now I know what you're thinking, that's gross for a shirt but it's not terrible for pants, well this motherfucker sleeps in the pants that he wears during the day. Yeah you read that right. This disgusting motherfucker sleeps in his jeans and his khakis. Just goes to bed, wakes up, goes to class, and repeats for weeks on end. I don't even know if he changes his boxers. What I do know is that he does not shower, like, at all. I know this because the cleaning people come once a month to clean our bathrooms and when they do that they take all of the shampoo out of the shower and put it on the back of the toilet.  It usually takes Matt a few weeks to a month to put his shit back in the shower. YES THIS DILLHOLE DOES NOT EVEN SHOWER ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS. We started the current semester in early january and I know for a fact that he has not showered since the first week, so it has been OVER A MONTH since he last showered. I got curious last week and picked up his shampoo bottle that he has had since the beginning of the year to see how full it was. Almost completely full... Like it feels like it has been used twice. 

But wait, there's more! I told you how he is constantly playing LoL, right? Well it causes him to procrastinate, like a lot. He took 9 credit hours (with three classes) last semester (You're considered a full time student at a bare minimum of 12), and he was always complaining about all nighters. He probably pulled one all nighter a week. Almost without fail on a daily basis I would hear him complain to his friends from high school about how hard the workload is in college, and how much work he had to do, and then he would go and play LoL at least until I went to sleep at 1am. That's not all though, Matt somehow managed to get a C- in his Algebra class last semester (Yes you read that right too, he hadn't reached college level math yet so he was taking an algebra class to be eligible for college math courses), a low B in his History 101 course, and a B in his intro to art history course. Yes, with 9 credits, and one class that wasn't even college level, he managed to finish the semester with a GPA around 2.5..... and his excuse was that his teachers sucked.


Now you may be wondering, why haven't I introduced him to some people? Why I haven't I helped him make friends so that he would leave our place more often? Well believe me, I've tried. Matt will only go places with me if he has an incentive to go there. That means that he will only leave our place if there is an incentive for him to do so, which means he only leaves to go to class or get food. He has actually only left our room for something besides food and class three times this entire school year. Twice were with me. I've invited him to go with me to my friends houses and dorm rooms before and his response is that he thinks we're going to peer pressure him into drinking or smoking weed, I told him that if anyone did that we would leave right away. He said that I was lying. 

And that's Matt, if you're wondering, no he still has not made a single friend to this day, and no he has not yet realized that he's disgusting.

**TLDR** My roommate showers once a month, wears clothes 24 hours a day for weeks on end, plays LoL on a daily basis with his friends from high school and yells loudly while he does it, and hasn't left our dorm room for any reason other than class and food more than three times this semester. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two things,

I wish I had tried. I was one of those kids that was smart and knew it but was too naive to realize that I had to prove that I was smart to other people. By the time I realized that I had fucked up I was halfway through sophomore year with a sub 2.5 GPA. It was too late for me to get into a good school. I was just accepted into my dream school as a CC transfer. Yeah I saved a bit of cash, but I missed out on the opportunity to join a frat and I never had a true dorm experience.

I also wish I had played a sport. Once you leave high school you basically lose the opportunity to play a lot of sports. Most communities don't have adult (tackle) football or lacrosse leagues so it's really your only chance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Considering a transfer to IU. Can you guys help me out with some questions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-15 06:53:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm currently a freshman at a CC in California and I love it but I'm not sure I want to wait another year before I can transfer into a University. I was looking up good econ schools and I noticed that IU has a pretty good econ program and doesn't require 60 credits before you can transfer so now I'm interested.

1) What is the party scene like? I live near the UC Santa Barbara campus so I can basically rage whenever I want and the alcohol is plentiful. Do you need to go greek to go to good parties? Do people ever just kickback and smoke weed?

2) If I decide to go greek is it hard to get into a top frat or are they pretty welcoming? I've got a lot of friends here that are Betas and ATOs and most of my friends from back home are Lambda Chis, idk if that would help me get into those frats but I've got that connection.

3) Is housing expensive? I'm currently paying $650 a month for a shared room in a 5 bedroom house so lower housing costs would definitely be a plus.

4) Is the econ program significantly more difficult to get into than the school itself? 

Thanks!

Edit:

Also the campus looks pretty big, how do people get around? Most people skate here but my guess is that you can't do that in the winter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I'm not in the marijuana business I feel I can give you some insight on at least some of this.

How did you maintain a continuous stock that likely includes several strains? 

Marijuana is semi-perishable, meaning it's not like milk but it also can't just sit on a shelf for a year. You'll want to utilize a "just in time" inventory. Meaning you only order more when your stocks are dwindling. It makes absolutely no sense from a business standpoint to have surplus inventory, especially if it has a shelf life.

Did you couple your business with other accessories such as glass, grinders, tobacco, vapes, etc?

Most dispenseries carry at least a few essential smoking supplies and devices; grinders for sure, rolling papers, some cheaper glass pipes, etc. With the existence of online head shops it doesn't make too much sense to carry high end glass because if anyone comes in to look at it they're probably going to end up buying it online for a cheaper price.

How much competition did you initially experience?

so far no states are letting you just open a recreational dispensery willy-nilly like you can with a convenience store. Dispenseries require special licenses that are handed out sparingly, if you can get one then it's beneficial because it limits competition. Unless your pricing model is so fucked up that people are willing to go across town to the other dispensery then competition won't be an issue for several years.

Was the business failure rate in your area following legalization?

Recreational dispenseries have only existed for about a year in two states. That data doesn't exist yet. </TEXT>

The second time was a few hours later and I took maybe 5-6 good sized hits and again didn't get noticeably high. This was good shit too, I gave some to a homie earlier this week and he got absolutely ripped. Any ideas why I wasn't getting high? I didn't grind my weed this time, I just ripped up the nug and packed it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean if you want a bitch car then sure, go for the miata. Theyre completely different animals at this point. It's like comparing apples to oranges. The miata isn't fast. It's lightweight and fun to flick around out on a twisty country road. The new Z's aren't like their predecessors from the 70s and 80s. They're not fun little lightweight cars. They're big and heavy and better suited for a drag strip or a full race track than an auto-X course. If you want a fun lightweight car that doesn't have the reputation of being a chick car (cough miata cough) then look into the Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT-86 (they're the same car just rebadged for different markets). If you want a convertible that's lightweight and fun as hell then hunt down a Toyota MR-2 spyder or a honda S2000. But unless you're trying to be mistaken for a 16 year old 90210 princess I'd avoid the Miata. I'm not trying to say the miata is bad by any means, but there are other cars that are a hell of a lot more fun that won't havd people making fun of you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because this wasn't an OD in the sense you're talking about. If my doctor prescribed my a lethal dose of oxycodone then he probably would be charged with malpractice and maybe even negligent homicide. This however, happened because someone was selling adulterated pills. In all likelihood these people took what would have been a non-lethal dose of mdma but it ended up containing enough of the adulterant to kill them. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-12-24 10:37:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been taking welbutrin for a bit less than a year now -150mg XL (extended release?) and I'm planning on rolling for the first time at an upcoming festival. The interactions page on erowid cautions about how welbutrin can alter the effects of mdma but doesn't really go much more into it. Is there anything I should be worried about? I went through an extremely depressed phase for about four months before I started taking welbutrin and it helped immensely. I occasionally miss a dose but it doesn't cause any noticeable changes when it happens. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm trying to lose weight and I find it A LOT easier to control my caloric intake if I skip breakfast and lunch (sometimes I'll have a power bar or something fast) and just eat a large dinner. Is there any harm in doing this? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-24 00:35:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So for the past two weeks, and occasionally throughout the past couple of months, what I've been doing is drinking water throughout the day and maybe having a power bar or something like that and then just eating dinner. I find that it's easier for me to not snack during the day when I can distract myself from my hunger than at night when I'm trying to go to bed. So I usually eat a 1000-1500 calorie dinner that can keep me stuffed. Will this adversely affect my weight loss or is it effectively the same as eating three 500 calorie meals a day without snacking?  I'm 18/M/5'9/210ish lbs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you're saying. I suffered through depression for most of my senior year of high school.  I honestly considered killing myself a couple times. I was lucky in that the first antidepressant i tried with my doctor worked. If you have access to modern medical care then I think that you should try every antidepressant available to you before you consider killing yourself. At the same time, I recognize that what I went through is no life worth living. If you've exhausted your options and can't get out of that depressive state then, and only then, do I think you should be given the opportunity to commit assisted suicide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly didn't even think about it. The first time I ever smoked weed there was tobacco in the bowl for the third hit I took but I didn't rip a full bowl. The people I was with would take a hit and give me the bong to clear the rest. This time was only my third time smoking weed and I figured that it wouldn't be too different but it just completely fucked me up. My friend says I took way too big of a hit. I milked it all the way up the bong before pulling the bowl. I still feel a bit anxious and my tounge still feels weird but I'm doing better. I skipped my classes for the day to recover. </TEXT>

I hit it twice with just a bit of smoke left in it and it didn't do much and then the third time I took a pretty big hit that gave me a nice body high and a bit of a head high. About 45 minutes later I went home and crashed super hard. It felt like I got an amazing nights sleep and woke up well rested but all of today I was really tired and spacey and I almost fell asleep in my business class. I got home and napped for like four hours. Was that from the weed or did I just not get as much sleep as I thought I did? </TEXT>

I'm currently riding a Retrospec B SS and loving it! It really got me into cycling and I think I want to pick up a second bike. Enter the attack. Currently I think that I'm riding 10-20 miles a week, 30-40 if I really get going. I'm trying to ride more though so I'm trying to eventually do 10 a day for exercise plus whatever I do when I'm commuting.

<TEXT> I absolutely love the single speed bike I got about a month and a half or so ago. I've been commuting on it and riding maybe 20ish miles a week. 50 if I'm really going strong. I was considering buying a motorcycle but I think I might want to invest in a higher end road bike for commuting and fitness. Any recommendations? I'd like to spend no more than $1,000. I like the simplicity of the SS but I realize that upgrading to a geared bike might be worth it for when i start doing longer rides. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look for something in the description of the bike that says "flip flop hub." That allows you to flip the back wheel and make it a SS. I got [this bike](http://www.retrospecbicycles.com/b-series-fixie.html) about a month ago from a shop in my town and I absolutely love it. It's simple and lightweight. My only complaint is that it's terrible at absorbing bumps. </TEXT>

No. The circlejerk blinded people so much that they couldn't actually read past the title of that story. What he was actually saying is that since encryption can be used as a weapon, companies selling encryption software need to start making a good faith effort to confirm that the person buying the encryption software lives inside the United States.  </TEXT>

What you neglect to mention, or didn't read, is that he did this to **10 different kids**, not to the same girl ten different times, and he intended to share the films. By your own standard he's getting off easy at 2.5 years per victim.

Edit: I should add that I didn't know this guy. I graduated from SEHS this year, but the general attitude among seniors was that freshman girls are off limits. They're basically kids. Hell, some of them aren't done with puberty or have even started it for that matter.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm currently attending SBCC (Isla Vista FTW) and I love it here but after spending some time exploring the UCSB campus I've decided that that's no longer my first choice for transferring. I'm also really enjoying my investing class so I figure I might enjoy a business related career. 

So here's the thing, I've looked through my credits and I've taken almost all of the courses required by Cal. I just need to take a 19 credit load next semester to finish up the reqs. Of all of the UC transferable courses I've  taken I've gotten mostly A's with a few B's mixed in there, but my non-UC transferable courses are mostly B's. The transfer website says that they only calculate your GPA based on your UC transferable courses. Can someone with experience in this tell me if my non-UC transferable courses are going to hurt my chances? I'm not sure if what they're saying on the website means that they totally ignore those courses or that they look at them but don't consider them as much in their final decision.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comes out on October 4th so we won't know for sure until then but it's essentially a very bland gopro. Just press the top button and it'll turn on and record. Hold it and it will take time lapse shots. Records in 1080p at 60fps or 720p at 30fps and auto adjusts for light conditions. If you just need something to cover your ass in case a driver does something retarded or you want to record track days then this is a good choice. If you're looking to record fancy videos for a documentary or highlight video or whatever it will do but the GoPro hero 4 or Hero 3 will give you a broader range of recording options. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How the fuckity fuck fuck can someone get a fucking education when they spend an entire semester training and practicing to play fucking football

By putting in work. All of these kids playing div 1 football know what they're getting themselves into. Likely their varsity teams in high school had incredibly rigorous training programs. Some of them like Jonny Manziel take easy course loads because they know they'll go pro. Some of them like Colt Lyerla do that and fuck up. And some of them like Marcus Mariota, arguably the best div 1 QB right now, put in work. Marcus Mariota earned a general science degree in three years. Now he's taking a lax course load for his senior year so that he can get drafted. 

Here's a list of Oregon players from the 2019 season that were honored academically.

<TITLE> Potential transfer with some questions about the party scene and greek life </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-24 09:14:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A bit about me: I currently go to SBCC and live in Isla Vista. After talking to my transfer counselor I've learned that I can probably transfer to USC and start as a sophomore in the fall of 2015 if I take certain classes this spring. USC was actually my second choice behind UCSB but I didn't get into either and I decided to TAG into UCSB rather than attend one of the four years I did get into. 


* Enough about me though, what I'm wondering is, how is the greek life at USC compared to the scene on DP here in IV? Am I going to feel let down by it after I've experienced Halloween and Deltopia? 

* Coming from a middle class family that hasn't done anything spectacular,  what are my chances of actually getting a bid from a good fraternity? (My cousin is an ATO so that could be cool).

* Does the USC campus have a college town vibe or does it feel like you're in a big city?

Thanks! </TEXT>

That was true like 5 or 6 years ago when the blackberry waa making the only widely produced phone that resembled a smartphone and had a full keyboard but nowadays it doesn't matter. Iphone, Galaxy,  it doesn't matter because they all have business apps, full keyboards, and ease of use. If you just want to do business then any of the major smartphones will work for you just about equally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I crashed my bike today and now my confidence is a bit shot.I haven't ridden regularly for about four years and I bought the bike on Thursday to get around school and I've ridden it pretty much everyday since and I've loved it! However, tonight I was going for a ride and asi pulled away from the stop sign I stood up and pedaled which threw me off balance and caused me to crash in the middle of the street. Honestly I'm lucky I was under a street light so the oncoming car saw me and stopped. I managed to get away with a few minor scrapes on my elbow and what feels like a bruised rib. My main problem is I'm embarrassed, my confidence is shot, and I'm a bit scared to go riding again. Any advice?  </TEXT>

If you're rolling up to an active shooter situation in a squad car you're in for a bad time. The fact of the matter is that even a .22 can penetrate every part of a car except the engine block. 

[Here is a video if a .22lr and common pistol rounds being tested on a car door](http://youtu.be/lkYBd9p3b8M). Whether it fits your agenda or not you need to admit that it's well within reason for police departments to own an armored vehicle.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's backwards retarded and completely misleading. Those rules of engagement are to some extent unique to the US, and were set by Obama. Before 2010, when the Taliban was still using gunfire as a common tactic, it was fire on people that were threats, especially in close quarters areas. Something else to think about:

<TITLE> Would a plastic surgeon ever do the consult for a mole removal and then send the notes to another surgeon to do the procedure? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-08 08:58:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So here's the deal, I've got a mole in the middle of my face and it's always bugged me and I want to get it removed before I go to college. I had an appointment with a dermatologist and they referred me to a plastic surgeon because they couldn't get the scar to flow with the natural lines of my face. The plastic surgery place was slow to get back to me and it's now a week and a half from the time I leave for college and I'm just now getting the appointment set. I originally wanted to have the procedure done here abd then have a doctor in my college town remove the stitches, but it seems like that might not even be possible at this point,  so if I had a consult here would the doctor be able to send his notes to a doctor in my college town so I could have it done right when I arrive or is that unlikely/illegal/impossible etc?

Edit:

Conversely, is it possible to have the procedure and consult done in the same appointment?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-08-07 19:32:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was helmet shopping and the store owner was hard selling me a high viz kabuto kamui. The price is around $250 and it seems like a decent helmet. It's got the eye glasses insert port things, a drop down sun visor, an antifog insert, and a quick clip chin strap thing. 

Apparently the company is new to the US so the products are being sold more cheaply than they normally would. The guy at the store basically said that they're only a step below Shoei.

Is that true? If it is then it seems like a pretty good deal but I'm not sure.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A couple weeks ago I overhead a conversation at the DMV but it's just now dawning on me how amazing this guy is.

 So I arrived at the DMV and took my number. Usual DMV shit. I've got like a 90 minute wait time. I go take a seat and end up eavesdropping on a conversation that's happening behind me. It's this 20 something black kid talking to a 40 something Hispanic dude with a fairly thick accent. They're shooting the shit and doing the normal small talk thing and the hispanic guy gets around to asking the kid what he does. The kid says that he usually works construction but hasn't been able to find a job lately. They talk a bit about construction and then the hispanic guy tells the kid how to apply for a job at McDonald's and how it's a great place and whatnot. At this point I'm sorta rolling my eyes and thinking what the fuck is this guy talking about. The kid says he's applied everywhere and no one is hiring. The hispanic guy says to apply to a specific McDonald's location and that he can get the kid some hours. At this point the kid asks how he can do that and the hispanic guy replies that he's the owner of that location. The kid asks how that came to be and the hispanic guy says that his family immigrated to California ehen he was about 10. During high school he knocked up his girlfriend and took a job at McDonald's to pay all the bills. He worked at McDonald's for 20 years before he was promoted to manager and after 5 more years he had saved up enough money to purchase a franchise location. 


I'm blown away. I look at my life and myself and I know I couldn't do that. I couldn't work at a fast food restaurant for 20 years to support my family. That man is a better man than me and he's only ever worked at fucking McDonald's.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the basic strength test is that you need to lift a stretcher loaded w/ a 150lb person with help. That's easy enough with deadlift training but I was talking to some EMTs and some people over in /r/ems and they said that deadlifts are all fine and good, but more often than not you're not going to have time or room to use proper DL form and I'll be carrying the stretcher in awkward positions on stairwells and stuff. So that said, I'm doing Coolcicada's PPL right now, but I want some suggestions for a workout that will strengthen all the little muscles in my back so I don't snap it if I'm lifting a 210lb dude from a weird position.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm in a car doing 45 on a four lane road and I've got a car in front of me, a motorcyclist slightly behind in the lane next to me and a car in front of the motorcyclist. This van is coming up behind me doing 55-60 and the car in front of me decides to slow down to turn right. Well, the van doesn't see us slowing until the last second so to avoid rear ending me he swerves into the left lane still going ~55. The motorcyclist somehow sees him at the last second and guns it while swerving into the space in front of me.

If that motorcycle didn't have that reaction time I would be telling a different story. Stay safe out there. </TEXT>

I then went to my afternoon weightlifting sesh and ran into my buddy. We got to talking and I ran out of time so I skipped the shower again. The next day I pop in the shower and **HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS WHAT THE FUCK.** My left thigh and the left side of my balls were burning like a mother fucker. Now I've gotta spend 2-4 weeks using antifungal cream on my junk before my shit stops burning or I can have sex that isn't painful and embarrassing.

To be completely honest, I was about ready to write off motorcycles as a lost cause, but today was so fun once I got the whole pressing thing.

So I'm wondering how I can practice more. My instructors recommended that I come back and take the intermediate rider training or practice for awhile before I really try to hit the streets so I don't stall out in an intersection or something. I can work on all that friction zone stuff at my house, but to practice braking my issue is that the nearest large empty parking lot is a few miles away. Any ideas on what I should do? </TEXT>

I get off the line correctly about 50% of the time and the rest I'm just having trouble. Do you have any tips or tricks? The parking lot we're using is weird because it's sloped a bit so you have to apply more throttle depending on ehat side youre on. I need to improve clutch control because I really do not want to fail tomorrow and have to pay another 200 dollars. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> M/18/5'10/SW:247/CW:???/GW:150

So six months ago I wouldn't touch a salad with a ten foot pole and the only time I did anything that would get me out of breath was when I went up stairs quickly. 4 months ago I started a strength and conditioning class at my high school which got my mile time from a ~16:40 to a ~13:15, which is great! but I wasn't progressing fast enough! So, I go to the gym twice a day now! In the early afternoon I go do a 40-60 min cardio/light lifting workout, and on the way I stop and pick up a cobb or caesar salad and a bottle of water. Then in the evening I go do a 40-60 minute light cardio/heavy lifting session. I haven't been completely keeping track of my calories but I think I'm eating around 1800-2000 per day. I've been supplementing creatine and whey protein so that I can continue to build muscle mass while in caloric deficit. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-06-15 18:54:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been lifting for about 3.5 months now and I'm at this kind of weird inbetween stage where I could really do either a beginner or intermediate workout. I'm looking for something that I can do 5-6 days per week. My primary goals are strength building, fat loss, and muscle growth. 

I'm so confused by the different workout plans and I have no idea how to decide. I've looked at a [P/P/L Routine](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833) but it seems like it'll leave you with an underdeveloped lower back. I've looked at [Cory Gregory's program](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/cory-gregory-fitness-360-lifted-up-training.html) and that one also looks good but I would probably have to sub out day 6 for a rest day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm thinking about starting this now. This would be my first legitimate workout routine, previously I've just been following a loose list of lifts set up by the weightlifting teacher at my high school but I've just graduated so I figure I should start a legit program. My goals are fat loss, strength gains, and a bit of bodybuilding. 

Here's the workout:

http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833

I'm concerned about underdevelopment of the lower back woth that program but I figure I can just do the variant that includes deadlifts. 

I'm also eyeing this program, but it might be a bit much. If I did it I think I'd sub out the 500 and 1000 rep days for cardio days.

<TITLE> Using protein powder to lose weight? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-09 06:56:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Would using protein powder work to help me lose weight? My plan is to use it as a meal for breakfast and occasionally other meals if I'm in a rush. The stuff I'm looking at is 120 cal/24g protein/1g sugar per serving so I figure it's healthy enough and the protein will fill me up nicely while also help in me take a nice chunk out of my calories. I do lift and have been doing so for about 4 months.

Edit: 

Secondary question,  for meal replacement would it be better to use whey or casein? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was doing modified dips yesterday, feet up on a bench and hands on boxes on either side of me, and after the first rep my collarbone started hurting like a bizatch. I could only do one more before the pain became unbearable. It hurt for about ten minutes afterwards and then went away and I continued my workout, even doing bench press with no problem. I chalked ut up to me being heavy and not having trained for that exercise before. Today though my left collarbone has a slightly dull pain when I move my left arm or head. Can DOMS occur around your clavicle after dips or do I have another problem?

At the time of the workout the pain was probably a 7/10, now it's a 2 or 3/10 </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a modification of your standard bench press sets. I put my usual BP weight, 25 each side, on the bars using 5lb plates. I do 10 reps for each set, and remove 10lbs after every set. For the last three sets I increase the number of reps by 5 so that on my very last set I'm doing 25 reps with just the bar.

Here is an article on the shooting:

http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isla-vista-rampage/gunman-kills-least-six-uc-santa-barbara-shooting-spree-n113931

Summary: A SBCC student tired of being rejected by women decided to have his "day of retribution." He stabbed his three roommates, ~~all believed to be chinese exchange students~~ two of whom were exchange students and one was an American, and then went on a shooting spree in Isla Vista where he intended to kill sorority girls. He ended up killing two sorority girls and one male UCSB student. 7 other people were wounded either due to bullet wounds or being hit by his car. The shooter wrote a 140 page manifesto detailing his hatred of women and outlining his plan to get revenge on society. He also posted a video on YouTube which is essentially a condensed version of his manifesto. </TEXT>

Next summer will be after my freshman year of college, what kind of part time work can I get to help build my resume for this? Currently I've got a line on a construction job. What websites advertise these jobs? I'd prefer to work in Wyoming, Montana, or Colorado at a larger ranch. Thanks for your help! And I apologize if the answers seem obvious to you guys but this whole industry is confusing to a kid that grew up in a city.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that we're considered one of the most bike friendly cities especially due to the bike lanes they add whenever they repave streets, but it seems exceedingly dangerous,  especially because a lot of bikers don't follow the rules of the road. I've seen one biker get hit in my years here, and I've been in and seen plenty of near misses. Just today I was walking on the bike path by SEHS and I saw some kid fly into the parking lot at 10-15 mph and nearly get hit by a car that didn't see him.

Until Eugene expands the bike path a bit more I'm afraid that I'll always view them as a bit of a nuisance.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I think I injured my lower back doing deadlifts improperly yesterday, what to do? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-02 17:58:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So yesterday I was weightlifting and one of the guys I was lifting with wanted me to do deadlifts. The form he showed me felt off but I went with it, legs straight and at shoulder width back bent when picking up the weight. After a few reps I felt a twinge on the lower right side of my back, initially I didn't realize what it was because it wasn't excessively painful, but I soon stopped when I realized ehat was happening. Since then I've had sort of a dull soreness in that lower right area of my back. I can't really feel it when I'm standing or lying flat on my back. Yesterday it seemed to go away when I was taking a hot shower. I really don't want to deal with a doctor but I also really don't want to screw up my back permanently. I know for certain that I won't use anymore free weights or do back exercises until I've researched proper form.

**tl;dr** Was deadlifting with straight legs and bent back yesterday and felt slight twinge. Today I have a sort of dull pain on the right side of my lower back that goes away when standing or lying flat. What do I do?

**edit**

I did a sort of stretching exercise and if I lift my knee so thet it's at a 90 degree angle while my body is turned to the right of my waist then when I put it down I feel a popping in my back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My only riding experience is the MSF course. I was just offered a great deal on an FZ6 but I'm worried that it might be too much bike. I am a big guy, ~260 lbs so I have been looking for something bigger than a 250. My other options are an SV650 naked, and a ninja 500. I know the SV650 is tame for a 650 so I'm not as worried about grabbing too much throttle and launching myself to my death. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really wanted to go to a mid-top tier UC as a freshman, but alas it proved to be too hard to do as an out of state applicant. I have made the decision to attend SBCC and attempt to transfer to UCSB, USC, UCLA, or any other solid California school. In an attempt to squeeze the most enjoyment out of my few years of higher education I have also decided to stay in a private dorm (Tropicana Gardens). My concern is that I was going through some posts regarding SBCC on this sub, and it seems like SBCC students are discriminated against. Apparently they are even forced to wear a wrist band to get into Isla Vista (wtf? I didn't realize that IV is a gated community). Will being a CC student cause me much grief? I'm mainly going to SBCC so that I can transfer into a good school, but I'd be lying if I said that stuff like Deltopia didn't help me make my choice. I don't want to get kicked out of parties or hassled for being a CC student. So, what's the deal? Will I be able to live happily alongside you guys? </TEXT>

They are deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. The movie starts with them preparing for their deployment, but by far the most powerful part is that they interview the family members as well as the soldiers during their deployment. Finally, it follows their transition back into society and their struggle with PTSD. It'll make you want to cry, it'll make you want to laugh, and it'll make you angry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm wondering if these are symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. [I posted a related question here yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1y1mg7/can_depression_cause_you_to_blur_or_confuse/)

So about six months ago a thought popped into my head. I won't say what it is because it makes me uncomfortable. Basically the thought was, what if I'm a (x)? From there it started spiraling out of control.  I couldn't get the idea that I'm a (x) out of my head. At first it was no big deal, but eventually whenever I started planning for my future (college, after college, etc) the thought would pop into my head and I would tell myself that I couldn't do the things I want to do for fear that I'm a (x) and won't be able to control myself. That made me sad, but I pushed on. Around two months ago (when i was at the peak of my depression) I had a horrible intrusive thought related to the idea that I'm a (x). Basically in reality the course of events went one way, but the intrusive thought took them another way. However, in the past day or so I haven't been able to separate the two in my memory. Consciously I know that one is false and the other is true,  but something in me keeps trying to convince me that the intrusive thought is reality,  which it is not. It's really messing with my head. 

I decided to test this problem I have with keeping reality and my thoughts separate. Minor stuff was easy. If I told myself that on Monday I went out to lunch with John when in reality I went with James, could always pick out the lie. Same with very major stuff like when I tried to convince myself that I didn't get a traffic ticket two years ago. But there were some things that happened anywhere from two months to two years ago that I consciously know which one is the truth and which is the lie, but something in me says otherwise. 


**TL; DR** 

Consciously I can separate truth from reality,  but somethinv between my conscious and my subconscious is trying to convince me that something I imagined is reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect I have depression. I plan on getting checked or tested or whatever, but something peculiar has been happening to me recently. I seem to be mixing a memory with an intrusive thought that happened at the same time (a month and a half ago) as the event I'm remembering. Now, I know which one happened and which one was the intrusive thought, but they're slowly becoming less separate and I fear that if this continues that I wont be able to distinguish them in 5, 10, 20 years from now. Now, the event in question happened during a two week span in which I was more depressed than I had ever felt in my life. Like I was seriously fucked up. I had a lump in my throat the whole time, intrusive thoughts were happening multiple times a day, I was nervous the entire time, I nearly had panic attacks. It was the first time I had ever thought to myself "Fuck... I need to get help". I was even crying when I was by myself which is very unusual for me. Now, my second question is, once I'm on meds, or my depression is gone, will it be easier to distinguish memories? One of the reasons I'm sure that I have depression is that I'm only 18, yet all of my memories have been blurring together. Like on thursday I couldn't remember whether several events had happened on monday, tuesday, or wednesday. </TEXT>

Some interesting points:

23) Motorcycle riders with previous recent traffic citations and accidents are overrepresented in the accident data.

24) The motorcycle riders involved in accidents are essentially without training; 92% were self-taught or learned from family or friends. Motorcycle rider training experience reduces accident involvement and is related to reduced injuries in the event of accidents.

27) Almost half of the fatal accidents show alcohol involvement.

35) Motorcycle riders in these accidents were significantly without motorcycle license, without any license, or with license revoked.

43) Seventy-three percent of the accident-involved motorcycle riders used no eye protection.

44) Approximately 50% of the motorcycle riders in traffic were using safety helmets but only 40% of the accident-involved motorcycle riders were wearing helmets at the time of the accident.

55) Less than 10% of the motorcycle riders involved in these accidents had insurance of any kind to provide medical care or replace property. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Victor Pride from [Bold and Determined](http://boldanddetermined.com/) does a great job of introducing people to nootropics, or life hacks as he calls them. He does an especially good job of [introducing people to Modafinil](http://boldanddetermined.com/2012/07/12/become-mighty-modafinil/). Here's the issue, he makes it seem like using nootropics, especially modafinil, will turn you into a Greek God capable of taking on armies and solving the riddles of the universe. He makes it seem like if you pop some modafinil today, then tomorrow you'll wake up as a billionaire. The issue is that when Victor Pride tells some kid that using Modafinil is going to be like using NZT-48, and it isn't, that kid is either going to tell everyone and their mother that nootropics are modern day snake oil, or he's going to try something stronger, like a high dose of adderall. I think that while he introduces people to nootropics, he is ultimately going to cause harm to the nootropics community. You've heard *my* opinion on the matter, but I'm genuinely curious to know what you think. I'm also curious to know if you think newcomers should be warned about him. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Found a Buell Blast for $2,335 on cycle trader, worth it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-27 05:12:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been saving up for a while now to get my first bike. I really want a WR250R, but they are so expensive used that I think I might just get another bike and trade it in when I get more funds. I found this Buell Blast:

http://www.cycletrader.com/listing/2009-Buell-Blast-110572701

I like the looks of the bike and I've come to the realization that I won't have any use for a D/S until I move to California in nine months, so maybe a street bike is just what I need. My concerns with the Buell is that they've been discontinued so parts will become scarcer and scarcer, I'm not sure how easy it is to get them serviced, and I'm not sure if it's as good a first bike as say a Ninja 300 or 500 or a CBR250R. I'd like your thoughts on the matter though. Buy this and ride it while I save up for a WR250R or just wait until I can afford the bike I want? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-01-27 05:00:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My evidence:

- The Mother has never been referred to in present tense by the narrator

- Whenever future Ted talks about her he sounds kind of sad. Definitely the whimsical, romantic Ted we've come to know and love.

- The last episode is titled "Last Forever"

- At the end of the last episode Ted makes a comment to the mother. "Nothing good happens after 2 AM (future Ted then interjects to say to his son, "except for you, luke)" before they set off to the hospital. After 2 AM.

- The producers decided on the ending early on. No matter how much they changed the plot around it wouldn't mess with an ending that results in her death.

- at the end of the "Time Travelers" episode Ted is seen pleading for more time with the mother. He wants 45 more days.

- The mother never narrates.

- She is never in any flash forward beyond 10 years or so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all! I'm new to this sub, but we recently had a men's rights victory at my school that I felt like sharing. My school has a daycare center that students are allowed to volunteer at. They receive credit for volunteering and if they do it for more than two semesters they become a paid employee. In the years prior to this school year, male student volunteers were not allowed to change diapers or escort the kids to the bathroom, even the boys. One of the male students saw the inequality in this and petitioned the parents of the daycare children to allow male students to change diapers and escort kids to the bathroom. He succeeded! </TEXT>

<TEXT> AR style rifles or "assault weapons" as they are commonly referred to are the main target of gun control. IMO this is the direct result of sensationalism on behalf of the media. I believe that anyone who thinks that AR style rifles are any worse than any other gun is uneducated on the matter and should have no say. I believe that anyone who uses an AR style rifle as an example of why we need gun control is either A) a politician using fear mongering tactics to further their cause, or B) a voter who is uneducated on the matter and should not have a say. I believe so because AR (Armalite NOT assault rifle) style rifles function exactly the same as any other semi automatic rifle. The difference is that AR style rifles have creature comforts that make them easier to carry around and use for long periods of time (like when you're hunting). CMV.

<TEXT> For the past few months I've had this thought/worry in my head. I know it's not true but I can't get it out of my head. It's this strange thing that I don't want in my head. If it were true then I would be shunned by society and I could be sent to prison. Again, I know it's not true but I still can't get it out of my head. 



Recently (past week) I haven't been able to stop thinking about it whereas I can usually push it to the back of my mind. It has caused me to become very depressed and stressed out. The thought that it could be true just pushes me over the edge. I don't know what to do. My research tells me that depression and anxiety can cause strange thoughts. If meds can get this thought out of my head and keep it from controlling my life then I want them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey all! Some quick questions about what else we'll need for this two day ATV trip. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-20 01:48:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey! So a few of my friends and I discovered an abandoned logging road awhile back. We drove pretty far down it until it became impassible via car. We scouted it on Google maps and it turns out it branches into a system of out of use logging roads, some of which lead to a coastal town that we all like visiting. Using Google's routing tool we discovered the whole trip would take ~8 hours on quads. But that figure could be off. We plan in borrowing a few ATV's, I believe the guy said they were 400cc Yamaha Utility quads.



What we plan on bringing:


Each Quad and rider will have:

*2 gallons of spare gas

*sleeping bag

*Camel Bak and spare water

*Hatchet+manual chainsaw

*Emergency water purification tablets and MREs

*Toilet paper

*Eating utensils

*Lighter

*clothes

*flair gun

*walkie talkie




Split between the three quads:

*tent

*gas powered chainsaw

*fire starters

*cooking stuff

*repair tools





Now I'm debating whether or not we need a collapsing toilet seat. We'll be about 20 miles from a major highway most of the time, but there will be logging camps nearby most of the time. Can you think of anything else we'll need. I think we might be able to do the trip in one day but I'm preparing as if we'll come across obstacles or won't be able to ride as fast as google suggests we can. It also depends on if there's anything we'll want to explore.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The main characters in GTA V are descendants of John Marston from Red Dead Redemption. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-14 09:25:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> John Marston has a special ability called "Dead Eye". It allows him to seemingly slow time while still retaining normal mobility, target enemies, and increase general combat effectiveness. 


In GTA V each character has their own special ability.


Franklin can slow time while driving.


Trevor takes less damage while dealing more.


Michael can slow time while shooting.


All three are watered down variants of "Deadeye". But wait! The plot thickens! In RDR John Marston has three conflicting personalities. He is a family man that just wants to get back to his family. He wants to better his lifestyle at all costs. He is a rough around the edges cowboy. 


Franklin has inherited the dreamer personality. All he wants is to get out of the ghetto.


Michael represents the family man. His end game is to be closer to his family.


Trevor represents the rough around the edges cowboy. Sure, he's insane, but he also has a caring personality. </TEXT>

Stewie has destroyed his time travel tech and has no way to build a new time machine. However, we also know from S4E30 that they have time travel tech in the future, and that future stewie (stu) is in possession of this technology.



My theory is that the Griffin's will make a time capsule for their future selves. Stewie will leave a letter for Stu in the time capsule begging him to come back to the present and help save Brian. We will then have an episode from Stu's perspective as he reads the letter and travels back in time to save Brian. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is Bitcoin's legal status as a gambling currency? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-23 23:48:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know you guys are not lawyers but I thought I'd ask.



It seems like online bitcoin gambling is legal, or at least a grey area. Would the same apply to brick   mortar bitcoin gambling? Say you had a system where they sent you a bitcoin payment, and you then gave them an equivalent amount of chips. When it comes time to cash out, you send them a digital bitcoin payment. Since bitcoin is not considered legal tender (yet), would this get around gambling laws? It seems like it would because there is no exchange of cash between parties



Edit: US gambling laws. </TEXT>

I'm pretty heavy, 240 lbs, can I make weight in a 1.6 or should I try to find a 1.8?

<TEXT> I'm probably not using the correct term to describe them, but I have examples.

--

On an ask reddit thread a few days ago there was a guy who mentioned he's part of a growing group that has decided not to identify as any race. Regardless of their birth race they have decided to mark, or write in, "other" as their race on forms.

--

There was a guy on reddit a few days ago asking how to tell his girlfriend that he wouldn't be getting her an engagement ring because it's an outdated practice.

--

Theres also the people who have decided to give everything a PC name. For example instead of referring to a male as just a man they feel the need to call them a cisgendered man.

--

Finally there was the guy who decided Sir and Mam aren't PC enough and is trying to create a gender neutral version.

--

Now I get these are of varying levels of extremity but I'd like your opinion on these types of people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made an Italian friend over the summer. He was by no means a smoker, but he would always have a cigarette in hand at parties. After I asked him about It he explained that in Europe, especially Italy   France,  smoking is much more accepted, and that many people there are social smokers. Why is it that in the US we have the mentality that you can either kill youself as a heavy smoker or you don't smoke at all, whereas occasional smoking is commonplace in Europe? </TEXT>

2. Do you plan to continue modeling swimwear?

3. What has changed since you became famous that most people wouldn't expect to?

4. How do you react when guys on the street try to ask you out?

5. Is there any competition between the SI swimsuit models?

So I'm looking at an Evo viii/ix or a WRX right now. But I'm looking for alternatives because those are pushing it in terms of insurance ccosts. Any ideas? Must be fast, built post 2000, able to handle snow, and less than 14k. Manual transmission is a plus. It doesn't need to be a four door but I do need to be able to squeeze four people in. Also why do Evo IX's still cost 20k+ </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little background, I'm a senior in high school searching for work/paid internships over the summer. My high school diploma is coming with something that basically says I specialized in business   marketing while I was there. I'm not sure if other states do this, but here in Oregon it's called Career Aligned Mastery (CAM). For privacy reasons I will not put my resume up, but I have some questions.

Is it appropriate to list my tutor as a reference? If I'm applying for a summer job online can I say that I have a high school diploma? I have not graduated yet, but I will by the time I've started working there. Finally, do I mention the CAM or will they not care? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Context: you can get as much as you want, whenever you want, totally for free. BUT the drug has not been studied, so there is no way of knowing if it will screw you up in the long run. 

NZT-48 is the pill from the movie Limitless.

My answer: Yes I would. A drug that unlocks every scrap of information you have ever heard or seen in your life while simultaneously giving you limitless motivation is too good to pass up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> REVIEW: Burger King Angry Whopper w/ Satisfries   a medium coke. ~$7.00 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-15 23:02:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all! In preparation for college next year I've decided to start trying to live on less than $50.00 per week including food, transportation, and entertainment. Today I decided to spend a bit extra on lunch because I've started riding my bike instead of driving. The review will be broken into two parts: The angry whopper, and BK's new satisfries.

Angry Whopper: Initially I was going to get chicken strips, but when I saw the pic of the angry whopper I had to try it. It's your standard sized whopper with pepperjack, bacon, jalapenoes, and a spicy sauce. The picture made it seem like they would put french fries on the burger for you, however mine did not. I sat down in the BK and opened the box. The burger looked similar to the picture. It is pretty messy. It wasn't too spicy it just had enough kick to the point that you could feel it. all in all 7/10 (on the fast food scale).

Satisfries: (medium size) These were the reason I went to BK. I had been wanting to try them. They are crinkle cut, and healthier than the classic BK french fries. I didn't get ketchup so I just a them plain which was fine because they are decently salty. They're not crispy at all. I would compare them in terms of size and texture to steak fries. Despite the mixed reviews I enjoyed them. They have more of the soft potato filler stuff in them than your stereotypical fast food french fry. They tasted like the fries at 5 guys except less greasy. 8/10 just don't expect them to taste like BK's classic fries. </TEXT>
