In early sobriety I was dealing with lots of heavy weather including coming to grips with being criminally prosecuted over unfiled and unpaid taxes and losing my professional license and career.  I was psychologically miserable, but I got counseling, dove back into AA and I got through it all, one day at a time.  Today, my sobriety is my most valuable asset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The great insight that I had about cravings is that it is an emotion just like anger, joy, jealousy, sadness.  In our case a craving is a powerful desire for alcohol and like all emotions it is fleeting.  Generally speaking time heals everything--including cravings.  One other thing, I was able to move along the healing considerably when I recognized that I am ex-drinker and therefore I no longer process that emotion. </TEXT>

Nor am I concerned with convincing anyone that they should QUIT drinking which to my way of thinking implies permanency.  What I am suggesting is a path to stopping drinking, TODAY and today, only.  Sometimes sustained time sober changes our entire outlook on our relationship with alcohol.  That's how it worked for me. </TEXT>

I guess what I'm saying was that the precursor to honesty for me wasn't so much courage as a whole lot of exhaustion and a tiny bit of willingness to admit that everything I felt, everything I thought might, possibly, could be...wrong.  With that openness to the possibility that I was living a lie--everything changed.

<TEXT> In the FAQ (on the sidebar) there is this [link which attempts to set some of this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/36cgmh/faq_timelines/)  Can I add as someone who has some time in sobriety including a prior 15 year continuous stretch of sobriety, that I would take all of this as very generic and only slightly relevant to your potential experience.  While we can all generally talk about withdrawal, breakthroughs, insights, recovery--because of who we are individually and genetically each of us may have different experiences.  Factor in the quality of individual effort at recovery and you have a whole other factor to consider.   Good luck to you--as a general rule: what effort you put in, is what you get out.  Remember the [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) say we act our way into better thinking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the distinction may have more to do with the traditional approaches to recovery--the 12 Step, AA model of recovery was based on a "singleness of purpose" which is to recover from alcoholism, BECAUSE prior recovery models: the WCTU, the Oxford Group, the Washingtonians all failed with multiple goals, issues, and ambitions.  AA officially declared we will deal with alcoholism and alcoholics ONLY.  This has changed considerably over the years but in my nearly 30 years in AA I've seen actual hostility to drug addicts and arguments about the appropriateness of mentioning drugs of any sort in an AA meetings.  Although no less a dualy-addicted recovering alcoholic by the name of Dr. Bob Smith (AA's co-fonder) discusses both issues in his famous "personal story" that begins the second section of AA's Big Book.  

By the way, not to argue with JBH,  alcohol was wholly illegal (Prohibition) when the modern recovery movement was founded in 1935.  So, embedded in our thinking (and the marketing of recovery by treatment centers) is the idea that addictions ARE different from alcoholism.  Whether this duality has a scientific basis or not, I have no opinion.  Still he distinction probably has more to do with the historical duality that is a legacy of the success and failure of recovery movements.

One other point: AA has dramatically de-emphasized the "singleness of purpose" observation and even traditional AA strongholds around Cleveland and Akron where I am active easily  embrace participation by both alcoholics and addicts. </TEXT>

Here's how I do vacations: I wake up and decide that I am not going to drink TODAY, only.  I usually hit a day time AA meeting and then I go for a long bike ride.  Sometimes I'll hit an early evening meeting too.  If there are any AA activities, dances, golf outings, etc. I might do those events too.  I hang out in coffee houses and I go to movies.  Have fun.  Then the next day, I do it all over again.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/dr_eleanorabernathy to r/stopdrinking.  Thank you for the introduction.  Let me share with you the [link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  I'm told the ideas there are helpful and "next" steps to doing this whole sober journey.

One other thing, "rock bottom" in my experience is not a place, it's a metaphor.  When we have had enough, when alcohol is no longer fun, that's rock bottom.  Oh, sure we could keep digging, or in my case drilling--but it doesn't change the fact that I hit rock bottom.

Good luck and I hope you keep posting and updating as you go along. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what else are you doing /u/razmataz_90 besides not drinking and some diet improvements to recover from the alcohol abuse that put you in the hospital with pancreatitis?  AA meetings, IOP, counseling  I would think that people are asking these questions because THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.  

When I was in early recovery my family and friends asked because they love me and were pulling for me to fully recover.  I had to stop being a resentful, selfish prick and learn to accept the support that came my way.  Even if it's just a question about my course and treatment, it is caring--and the least that I can do is be grateful and by sober actions show that change is REAL.   </TEXT>

Amazingly though, there is a former major crime prosecutor in Cleveland who while coked up shot his girlfriend at close range; went to prison for 7 years; and, who was reinstated.  Amazingly the same court disbarred a longtime civil attorney who didn't file and didn't pay income taxes (no fraud involved.)   Go figure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's what I did when I was learning (and I'm far from a master)--off the bike in off season focus on abs and squats.  Strengthen your core muscles, but get super strong at the hover squat position by sitting on a stool and rising and holding at 4 inches, 6 inches, and then controlled seating (not collapsing back onto the stool).  Then as you ride, learn to jump up from the saddle and use your body weight to push the pedal down, alternate with sitting and riding at a higher rev.  Then back up on the pedals.  This should become instinctive.  Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/Jadiki to r/stopdrinking.  I thought I'd share the [link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) with you.  It's what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I try to share it as part of the "handshake at the door" to the SD sober journey.  Good luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminds me of the quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson that was in my first comment at the original Honesty Week post:

"Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.

From this I take: judge the truth to yourself and speak it to yourself and if necessary to others; but be open to the idea that what you take as fact may not be fact and so you have an obligation to correct not only your mistaken belief, but speak the truth to others even at the cost of pride and ego. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sorry that this was your experience.  When I got sober in 1986 (for the first 15 years) the only "loss" I thought I had sustained was my relationship with my first wife who had been my childhood sweetheart.  I did lose that relationship but like JBH I was able SOBER to sit down with her one time and express my sincere regret.  Unlike JBH it was way too early in my recovery and I'm afraid it sounded like nothing but words, meaningless words.  And the damage I had done by then was not repairable with words.  As JBH points out, honest words gain credibility with honest actions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for being having the courage to be honest.

I would encourage you to go back through your post and comment history and try and get as honest a grip as you can on why you decided to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Why was it important in the first place?  And now, what do you think you're missing? 

You know if you ever read [my Saturday Share](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) how relapse worked out for me, so I'm not going to lecture you.  I will say that if I knew then what I know now--I would have begged my friends to lock me away until the impulse passed.  I barely averted death, for what?  To pour alcohol down my face!  What a waste.

My friend, I understand the impulse.  If you spend anytime sober you probably can't avoid the thought that you're missing something.  New craft beers, fine wines, parties, events, sophistication--in my experience it was all tears and ashes and tragedy.

<TEXT> I'm not good with internet hugs; but I will offer you some hope.  

My marriage was past due for divorce when I returned to sobriety in 2009.  We both had had destructive affairs. My HS sophomore son was trying to figure out if he was gay; my HS senior daughter was pregnant.  I was losing my professional license AND going to federal prison.  

Flash forward nearly 6 years, we are still married and very close and affectionate.  Life is complicated and relationships are complex.  My son is an award winning professional actor, comedian, and college student; my daughter is a college student; and, my grandson who lives with us, is the light of my life. 

What changed?  

Me.  I changed.  I got sober and stayed sober.  I dealt with my legal consequences honestly.  I went to counseling and stuck with it.  When my daughter needed recovery I was at every family night.  I did not change my wife or kids, I changed ME.  And as I changed everything around me changed.

<TEXT> You probably can't read the new posts and comments on /r/stopdrinking for anytime without coming across a slew of posts in which newcomers talk movingly about shame, guilt, remorse, and regret over past misdeeds.  Most of our misdeeds, as bad as they were, harmed only ourselves, but usually we hurt close family, friends and co-workers.  If you are anything at all like me you wanted a clean conscience and you felt the immediate compulsion to run out and confess and apologize.  STOP.

Honesty does require amends, often confession or apologies but as I said yesterday in my [Brutal Honesty post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3d67e1/brutal_honesty_is_not_honesty_its_mostly_just/) don't confuse honesty with brutality.  Our need to get honest is not a license to HURT others.  Ever.  

So how do we move forward to right past wrongs? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/Allied_Biscuit to /r/stopdrinking  Maybe you aren't an alcoholic but living without booze makes a lot of sense.  One of my closest friends in the World is a leading Class Action attorney and philanthropist--a total teetotaler.  Like you he had a family history of alcoholism and he CHOSE to not drink.  And yet he is the life of any party he's at.  So at this [link is the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which summarizes what I did to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much the standard advice for newcomers to /r/stopdrinking who don't really know if they want "to quit drinking" and who consider themselves "borderline" is--don't quit.  Quitting drinking implies permanence.  Instead STOP drinking for 30, 60 or 90 days and see if abstinence helps you get some clarity about your relationship with alcohol.  

Of course, many of us feel tremendous empathy for your horrible childhood, but it's not that unique in reality.  There are those of us with much better and those of us with much worse upbringing. Many of us can wallow in the misery of the memory of rotten parentage.  The question really is: what do you want to do with your life.  Personally, I chose to live and free myself from the legacy.  I do something I call [the Baby Steps every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) to stop drinking and to get sober.  Thus far I'm in a far better place than I've ever been.  Come jump in the lifeboat, if only for a month or two.  Begin with a decision not to drink TODAY, only.  Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate your post and observations.  Like a lot of things in early recovery, sustained time sober often results in an epiphany or sudden alterations in perception.  While I might not have appreciated why such a big deal is being made about this or that among my support group--time sober and suddenly I can see how huge an idea is and how it really plays out in my own life.  At least that's how I experience some of these things.  I needed to keep my eyes open.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In early sobriety I ill-advisably dated (and briefly lived with) a young woman, Audrey, who long timers on /r/stopdrinking have heard me speak of in past posts and comments usually in the context of why it's not a good idea to date in early sobriety.

One of Audrey's most striking characteristics was her tendency to pop off to her "friends" or newcomers in AA in a manner in which she would shrug and say, "'Sorry, I'm brutally honest." Except she wasn't, she was merely brutal.  This week while we talk about Honesty remember that in striving to be more honest, we can not and should not justify our rude and unsupportive behavior as "brutal honesty."  In sobriety we reserve brutal honesty for the man or woman in the mirror.  

When my SO asks if she looks fat in a dress, skirt, slacks--no amount of karma was ever earned by saying "Yes." </TEXT>

But more significant to me was that a guy I know in AA was the first responder on the scene.  He opened the door of the drunk driver's car after his fellow first responders attended to the dead and other injured.  He describes recoiling from the smell of alcohol and the driver in a panic asking, "Are they dead?"

<TEXT> As an active AA, within the fellowship just one dishonest predator can devastate a recovery community and drive out newcomers like crazy.  How can you spot this sort of character?  And what might you do to protect yourself?   For one thing, newcomers should be wary of too private a contact.  Solid supportive relationships form in the OPEN.  When someone sounds too good to be true; they probably are.  Remember, in recovery we are all drunks and addicts, so someone presenting as totally together isn't.  Other ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I WAS a liar.  I did not really appreciate it at the time.  I thought I was an honest person.  In reality I lied to achieve and gather to myself that which I valued.  I lied to manage how I was perceived.  Before I got sober and even for sometime after I got sober, I was a reflexive liar.  I have described how in March of 1986 I drunkenly fell down sustaining a quadriceps injury that required that my leg be placed in air cast.  This injury began my long effort to get and stay sober.  Remarkably every time I was asked about how I injured myself I told a different story.  Sometimes two irreconcilable versions to the same person.  During that same period, an administrative hearing officer told me that I had developed the unfortunate reputation for being not a serious or credible person.  That was my rock bottom.  But even after I stopped drinking the struggle to get honest and be honest was a real struggle, but as I learned ESSENTIAL to getting sober.  Ralph Waldop Emerson gave the following advice: "Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.   I call this getting molecularly honest.  And the person I needed to get honest with most in the world is ME.  Over the years and through my actions, only--I think I have been able to change the way the people who I most care about in the world see me.  I believe that today, I am perceived to be honest and trustworthy.  This has been a long haul, but it is the character asset that is most valuable to me in the world.  It is a gift of sobriety.

The simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. One word of truth outweighs the world. --Alexandr Solzenitsyn

<TEXT> It is said that alcohol is but a symptom or our "disease."  Personally, that was true for me, but amazingly after I undertook to stop drinking (which I did via [the things I describe at the Baby Steps post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) my underlying mental health issues were much improved.  In other words I was able to ACT MY WAY INTO better mental health.  Bill Wilson, one of the co-founders of AA describes in the book, Alcoholics Anonymous aka the Big Book that he had access to the leading mental health and addiction specialists of the day (1920s-1930s) and that self knowledge did not keep him sober.  So, /u/MenstrualJackson, we are not alone.  

Good luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a powerful post that gets at several core issues that I was speaking to someone about early, early this morning and over the past few days.  In my opinion we struggle with "honesty" or what AA calls the necessary prerequisite to sobriety: rigorous honesty--because, we want to "appear to be" smart, funny, attractive, and powerful when deep down we believe we aren't or we suspect we are fraudulent.  A personality distortion that can result from this struggle is narcissism--which is an obsessive, dishonest stage management of how we are perceived.  It's not uncommon to see people in recovery who are incredibly, even reflexively dishonest, and I suspect this also stems from not being comfortable in being in "their own skin."  I was one of these people, too.  

I had to learn to be vulnerable, honest, what I came to call--molecularly honest.  That extends to EVERYTHING I say on /r/stopdrinking and frankly all the Reddit forums.  If I am to grow up, I need to embrace honestly, who I am.

So while you felt bad, and vulnerable, /u/Englishfella -- I applaud your honesty and I am gilding you as a power of example.  Keep doing what you're doing and the next time you see your friend with the 14 years--go up to him and stick your hand out.  Congratulate him on his 14 years.  I suspect that if you can hang on to what you got, we will be celebrating you and looking to you for more wisdom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [ethical rules](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/mrpc/mcpr.authcheckdam.pdf) that apply to all lawyers tell us that all persons deserve competent and professional representation (the rules adopted in most states used to say zealous representation, but that idea justified unacceptable distortions in professional conduct). The rules also remind professionals that just because a matter involves repugnant or controversial allegations, that in and of itself does not justify declining to represent a client.  Remember if a person comes into an emergency room with gunshot wounds received in the commission of a crime, an emergency room provider won't decline medical services, right?  Having undertaken a representation, competent and professional lawyers pursue every defense, challenging everything from jurisdiction (the power to render judgment in a matter), investigation into facts, challenges based on the law applicable to the facts--so as to hold the prosecution to EVERY element of the government's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is not the job of the lawyer to judge a client--the people, the finders of fact and of law will do that.  The lawyer is ultimately just one of the advocates in an imperfect system of justice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love AA and I avidly work an AA program, but I agree you hear a lot of stupid shit in AA meetings sometimes.  I try not to judge, but I'd like to think that I've reached a point where I developed some discernment between substance and utter bollocks.   Remember even with substantial time sober, these are many of the same drunk clowns who made sitting on a barstool insufferable.  As Slip likes to point out, some are sicker than others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I would be going to /r/alanon meetings to learn some coping strategies with my brother's alcoholism.  A lot of us in recovery are "double winners" so to speak; and it looks like you might be one too.  The other thing is I would have to look long and hard--as you are doing--with what you thought you were doing with the cans of beer.  Remember anger and resentment are the chief offenders for relapse.  Good on you for posting about this; because I've been there and all I needed was one good excuse and I spent 7 years in relapse hell.  Don't go there, it's not worth it.  Most of us don't make it back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alcoholism, or an alcohol disorder, or an alcohol addiction is more than a bad habit, or a bad choice according to medical and mental health professionals.  For many alcoholics if not most it is an intractable disease resulting in misery and premature death--so it is DAMN HARD to quit drinking or to stay stopped on will power alone.  What to do?

I did the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It may sound like semantics, but I never "quit drinking."  Instead I make a daily decision not to drink TODAY, only--no matter what happens good or bad.  I tough out the tough hours.  I doggedly persist for one day.  One Day.  Then I do it again.  Amazingly, it get's easier--after the first tough days, and the first couple of bumpy weeks as long as I don't pick up the next drink.  Key to my success was throwing myself head first into recovery.  All-in.  A real commitment.  

That my friend is my best recommendation for trying again.  Make a decision, go all-in, doggedly persist, repeat.

Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are talking about why the POTUS should have continuous "security" 24/7 versus the Ohio taxpayers paying for security for a governor who ran for a full term fully intending to become a part-timer on the taxpayer's dime when he ran for President.  If that's illogical to you, then you might consider a refresher course on logic, maybe somewhere other than a home school, this time.

<TEXT> I was sentenced to federal prison about a year after I returned to sobriety in August 2010.  I had been a nationally prominent civil trial lawyer with a business worth potential millions.  I was disgraced and fearful and miserable and I didn't drink.  I didn't drink the day I was sentenced or any day since that time by doing what I talk about all the time: I made a daily decision not to drink TODAY and I doggedly persisted.  No single event, no bad news or good, no sadness, no disappointment, no loss is too great to bear for one day.  Then I repeat, tomorrow.  

My life is filled with happiness, joy, and freedom because of the decision I make TODAY not to drink.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, I'm glad I asked.  

Personally, I am not that different than you in terms of the underlying anxiety issues and to be honest, even though I live in a major American city (Cleveland) AA can be a little like high school from the standpoint of early sobriety.  On the other hand, given some blind courage and a gritting commitment to just go and actively listen my entire life (including my bipolar disorder) changed positively for the better.  Also, most of my preconceptions even about how I would be received were completely mistaken.  This has been my experience with AA everywhere I've gone over 30 years.  

Go it alone didn't work for me, but it may work for you.  Good luck, and I hope you will consider keeping /r/stopdrinking for support. </TEXT>

I jumped into AA meetings and activities, that was huge.  Then I asked myself what did I always want to do.  In my case I always wanted to play guitar, so I signed up for an adult education class, then private lessons, and then I joined a group.  It was great.  I resumed avid cycling and I joined a cycling group for weekly night rides.  I joined a sober bowling and gold league.  My life was soon overwhelmed with activities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, but I don't think the medical and mental health communities are at all focused on the "spiritual entity" part of recovery when they make the recommendation to attend AA meetings.  I think instead they realize that AA meetings are the most easily accessible, affordable, and effective programs of recovery.  

And might one, just "skip the middle man" and just go right to some conception of God?  If that were true there would be no drunk Roman Catholic priest, LOL!  In my experience, it is not a religious zeal, or spirituality that is at the heart of the recovery from alcoholism--it is instead an appreciation that ALCOHOL is the higher power and self will or will power alone can not in the usual case, beat the disease.  Instead a core recognition that the power of fellowship with like-minded others who are on a sober journey IS the solution.  From time immemorial, religious "cures" had been proposed and failed.  AA grew up as a radical reaction against the "moral" cure of the Women's Temperance Union, the Baptist pledge, and the Oxford Group.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This observation about speakers trying to convince themselves that AA works, may be true.  Remember, as they say in recovery "De-nile (denial) is not a river in Egypt" and in early recovery we are often still awkwardly selling ourselves on recovery.  Embedded in AA recovery is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy--a deliberate focus on changing behaviors in order to change thinking.  I often compare it to learning how to play guitar--which I successfully undertook in early sobriety.  At first it's really hard, awkward, uncomfortable.  Nothing came easily for me.  But as I slowly learned chords, scales, and songs and I practiced my brain automatically sped me up so that I sound pretty good even with my rudimentary skill set.  The same's true for new people in AA.  They may look awkward, or even phony, but let's not judge--in many cases these are the same hopeless, helpless drunks that made little or no sense when we sat on the barstool next to them staring at Sportscenter on the TV over the bar. </TEXT>

I had to get help and stop drinking in order to find true happiness, and my authentic self.  Sustained sober time was an answer to the lies that alcohol was telling me and I got sober doing the simple actions I detail in the [Baby Steps post at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Let me be clear: I can't be happy drunk when drunk I text others about suicide.

<TEXT> It's interesting, almost the entire medical and psychological communities agree that alcoholism is a disease; but, the occasional dissenter when given voice in popular media or by Penn   Teller tends to animate the debate.  It's like the anti-vaxxer-thing in my opinion.  So why is alcoholism NOT a disease in their opinion?  Well, for a variety of reasons almost all of which are highly debatable--but, the big one is: you can't "catch" alcoholism like you can AIDS or Dengue Fever or Small Pox.  But alcoholism isn't an infectious disease (although if you think about it, maybe it is to some extent)--alcoholism or the disorders that we conventionally think of as alcoholism is more like diabetes or heart disease.  Our early life choices, and our genetic predispositions often bring on the disorder.  As far as I am concerned, I may not be responsible for getting my "disease" but I am wholly responsible for daily treatment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only speak for myself--but, early only (and thankfully) I got involved in AA, mostly because I was afraid of what I mistakenly imagined AA to be--a bunch of old men shaking over styrofoam cups of coffee on folded chairs presided over by the Jayzus-cult.  I was so willing and open minded at that point in my life I was willing to try anything to get and stay sober.  So AA meetings worked for me--and, it was at an AA meeting that I encountered the idea of getting a sponsor (mine's like a Big Brother) and more importantly I found the [AA 12 Steps.](http://silkworth.net/aa/12steps.html)  Working with my sponsor and support network I "did the Steps" which is a systematic way of addressing guilt, shame, misdeeds, and my fears about my damaged relationships.  Oh, and I didn't catch religious cooties--in fact I suspect that to the consternation of some in AA meetings when I hear too much God-talk I aggressively shoot down the notion that belief or non-belief in anything or any God-like being is prerequisite to successfully working an AA program--it's not.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cravings are a powerful desire for (in this instance) alcohol.  By definition a craving is an emotion which if I give into it, I reinforce.  The way to combat a craving is to substitute other reinforcements--like recovery meetings, socializing with dry people in dry places (coffee houses), pursue an athletic endeavor or other interest.  If I don't give in to a craving, the powerful desire will disappear over time.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to keep SOBER through the holiday weekend </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Personally, I treat every day, no matter the occasion, no matter the event, no matter the friends who are there or not, no matter who's drinking or not--as one more day in which I will make a decision not to drink TODAY no matter what AND doggedly persist in the commitment to myself.  It is not lost on me that many of you are struggling, maybe even obsessing over this holiday weekend (it's Independence Day in the US)--that's natural in early sobriety.  But if you can win the daily SOBER victory future holidays, or upheavals will be much easier to handle.  Let's celebrate our independence from alcohol this weekend!  Who's in? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me be clear--life is not BORING.  Boredom is a common *emotion* in early sobriety that with sustained time sober most of us get over.  My experience is that we are well-advised to be on guard around all of our emotions in early sobriety since our alkie-thinking can use any of these sensations as an excuse for relapse, especially anger and resentment.  Good work on the 15 days sober! </TEXT>

Still today I saw a very funny Stephen Colbert interview of Eminem on a local Michigan cable access channel.  Very funny, but guess what Eminem was wearing?  [At the link, but a trigger warning as there is alcohol in a couple of the segments not involving Enimen.](https://youtu.be/rVPlMM_aSn4) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/WootTurnt to r/stopdrinking. I like to welcome the newcomers with [the link to the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is my way of answering the implicit question: now that I'm thinking about stopping drinking, what do I do next?  The Baby Steps are what I did and do to stop drinking and to get sober.

Good luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/BoilerKing to r/stopdrinking. There's a saying in sobriety, no one comes through the doors of recovery doing cartwheels.  I was in a similarly very dark place, in fact at 14 months sober I did a short federal prison sentence.  So this is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober:  [the baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) Many of us on /r/stopdrinking got early traction by doing the things I lay out there.

<TEXT> I am so sorry that you are dealing with this illness but the recommendation of Al Anon *is not* a meaningless gesture.  It works.  Let me explain how it worked in my life as THE ALCOHOLIC.  My wife started going to Al Anon meetings without saying one word to me about it.  I could see and sense some sort of change come over her that I didn't understand.  When I did confront her about where she was going and what had changed she explained that it was Al Anon meetings.  Amazed and genuinely clueless, I asked her who the alcoholic was?  When she said, "You." I was floored.  The seriousness of my situation had in an instant become real to me.  And while it would be some time before I finally got sober, I could never shake the message.  In her actions to take care of herself, she communicated what ultimately I needed to hear--the unshakeable truth.  

Good luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a rule I avoid "tests."  The only test I need to pass is the one where I decide that I am not going to drink; and I persist to bedtime.  On the otherhand my wife drinks fine wine (although she kept it out of the house for 10 months or so after I got sober again in 2009) and my wife's enjoyment of her glass of wine at supper 4-5 days a week is fine with me.  After I make my daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what--alcohol is out of MY movie for the day.  Others drinking has NO impact upon me, and if it did I would leave the vicinity.  Nothing is going to change that today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excellent comment, the keyword is FEELING.  Boredom is just that an emotion just like happiness, anger, frustration, resentment, joy, desire, and cravings.  We get stronger each time we see the emotion and doggedly persist in our daily commitment to ourselves not to drink TODAY, only. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/standardcapacityman to r/stopdrinking.  I don't know what sort of device you're working off of so I don't know if you can see the sidebar, but there is a link to the 2014 survey which you might find enlightening.  Most of us report in the polling data that we were able to stop drinking with little or no discomfort.  Obviously to some extent or another we are all different and our use was different, but I'm suggesting that most of us get through the rapids pretty easily. At this [link is a post called the Baby Steps that lays](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  There might be some "next steps" for you too.  good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's what works for me when I'm feeling "off" or that maybe I'm not as strong as was--I cling to the notion that I've felt this way in the past and it was usually a prelude to a breakthrough or some real insight that if I had not doggedly persisted I would never have arrived at.  I also cling to the hope and belief that my sharing even when I'm down--helps others when they are down and hanging on by what feels like fingernails.  That's what you did with this post /u/kittyislazy, you helped me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/Timetostop1989 to r/stopdrinking.  On the sidebar the results of the annual survey of our population is available.  It's a massive amount of information about almost every aspect of our demographic.  Amazingly, by far and away most of us stopped drinking cold turkey, and most of us reported little or no discomfort.  

Now for how to go about it, why don't you look over the [Baby Steps post at this link?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It has some good ideas for the "next things" you might want to consider as part of the move to sobriety.

1. Recognize that the first two weeks will probably suck;

2. No coffee, caffeine of any sort after midday;

3. Shut off all electronics an hour before bedtime; 

4. Except for soothing music. 

Remember, many of us went through this and our body and brains are healing.  Sleep will come.  And usually when it does we reach a point where our bodies and brains want to do nothing BUT sleep.  That's ok too.  Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recovery and sobriety works best, in my experience, when you do "service work"--and on /r/stopdrinking there are many opportunities to do service for the community as the morning Check-in volunteers demonstrate.  There are lots of other options, like commenting on newcomer posts, "attaboys and attagirls" for milemarker posts, and participation on the Chat, movie night, and so forth.  Find your niche, or invent it as others have done in the past and you may find that you are ahead of the game.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/redgalatea to /r/stopdrinking.  I'm sorry that you have struggled with relapse.  Relapse is a HUGE part of my story.  I also deal with, or dealt with manic-depression.  I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  As far as programs and faith--I hear you.  I'm super happy with my agnostic AA meeting home group which has enabled me to fully dive into recovery.

Good luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What an obnoxious post.  Prairie Home Companion is a significant media institution created by a formidable New Yorker writer that may elude your limited cultural understanding but which preserved, honored and satirized mid-twentieth century radio broadcasts; illustrated the history of the rural to urban transformation of America; and provided a weekly forum for all sorts of brilliant live music especially the obscure but worthy long before YouTube existed.  Your inability to grasp this fact does not render PHC or Keillor's artistic contributions invalid.  

P.S. Keillor is a Mid-westerner not a New Englander.  Keillor has more authenticity in his little finger than most of artists whose performance altars the Reddit hivemind worship at. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies
the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,
and family. In forming a marital union, two people become
something greater than once they were. As some of
the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage
embodies a love that may endure even past death. It
would misunderstand these men and women to say they
disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do
respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its
fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned
to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations
oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the
eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You really capture the essence of life behind bars.  I came back from my 5 months at FCI, Morgantown in 2010 and I told my wife that I was so angry at myself for feeling absolute hatred for some people I knew and resided with in those months.  Sadly, there have been at least one occasion since with a guy in AA where I felt those same feelings, so I strongly relate to this post.  Now imagine that your confidentiality is breached--things you said in a meeting were shared "on the yard."  Wow.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/sbarks to r/stopdrinking.  Personally, I found it ultimately not relevant that I answer *a priori* the question: Am I an alcohlic?  What I needed instead was some sustained time sober and the clarity that brings.  So at this [link is a set of ideas called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is based on my own experiences stopping drinking and getting sober.  I hope something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with
those chosen by the people. Our role is more confinedto
say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,
177 (1803). That is easier in some cases than in others.
But in every case we must respect the role of the Legislature,
and take care not to undo what it has done. A fair
reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the
legislative plan.

 Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve
health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all
possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent
with the former, and avoids the latter. Section 36B
can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congresss
plan, and that is the reading we adopt </TEXT>

I slide out of my bed onto my floor and I spend a few minutes reflecting on the AA 3rd Step and my wishes for family and friends.  I log on to /r/stopdrinking and record my commitment in the daily Check-in or later in the morning depending on what time it gets posted. Then I do a few things around the house and I'm off to coffee and to read the New York Times at a local Starbucks with my pal, "the Dude" where we solve the problems of the world, flirt with the women customers and hob nob with the other regulars.

<TEXT> 1.  I didn't "quit drinking" which implies "forever."  Instead, using the [ideas at the Baby Steps post I stop drinking by making a renewable resolution to not drink TODAY, only no matter what happens good or bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)

2. I was in professional and criminal trouble, and I was seriously considering killing myself; 

3.  I needed to extinguish the old reinforcers--friends, bars, clubs, events that fed my need to drink.  I found new reinforcers in recovery, morning rituals as I described in the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and by participation on r/stopdrinking.

Good luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One definition of alcoholism is progressively being unable to control the amount of drinking and actions under the influence of alcohol.  If you're interested in stopping why don't you consider the ideas at the [Baby Steps post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Lots of us came to sobriety with doubt and after we spent time sober discovered that we highly valued the new way of life for a variety of reasons including never driving drunk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My advice is very simple: 1. you aren't qualified to run a sober house so don't try; 2. keep alcohol out of your premises; and, 3. go to al anon meetings.  You might also try asking your question at r/alanon.  I don't mean to be unsupportive but the situation sounds untenable in my experience. 

Best of luck with this and thank you for caring so much for an alcoholic to dare to undertake it.  I hope I'm wrong but it does not sound like a good idea for you, your family or your friend. </TEXT>

That's great but that brings me to the [least popular advice in early sobriety: dry people, dry places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)  Obviously, this is your sister's wedding, so you must attend, but what compels you to sit through a drinking reception and all that nonsense beyond an initial appearance and pictures?  

What I did in early sobriety was insure that I was at an AA meeting before and after the event.  That my transportation away from the event wasn't blocked-in, and I WALKED the moment I felt stress or temptation.

Good luck to you and keep us posted. </TEXT>

John G is about 10 years older than me, and I see or talk to him on average once a week.  He's like a big brother.  He's more conservative re: AA than I am, but he's also the primary source of the information that makes up [the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I too shared the /r/stopdrinking website with him and he really doesn't get it, but toi be fair he really doesn't understand his cell phone, either--although I told him that lots of info that I communicate originated with him. 

I get SUPPORT and good information from John G about recovery and someone who will pick up the phone when I call.  I couldn't ask for more.  If I need friendship and running buddies I can find that too, although they don't need to be sponsors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excellent post, /u/yurikovski!  But, my friend, this is far from unusual. Coming to see and value the lifestyle changes in alcohol abstinence is really the point of the push to sobriety.  And the insight that alcohol use is merely a symptom of a larger problem, is classic recovery dictum.  So, here's my cautionary note: an object in motion tends to stay in motion, a drinker who is not making progress often as not falls back into the drinking abyss.  I did after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  

Good luck, my friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great post /u/big_mac_heart_attack.  I will say that when I was at 20 days sober I was in no position to judge whether I had lost a social life or not.  I was in no position to make any judgments about what the future held.  I was on an emotional roller coaster and it was going to takes some time before I could fairly assess anything.  I do know this--when I got sober I had to stay in dry places and with dry people to improve my chances of staying abstinent since in my experience and in the experience of my support network bars, clubs, and concerts were too close for comfort to my old reinforcers to my abusive drinking.  I needed new reinforcers which is what I got when I jumped into recovery which for me meant AA meetings and activities.  Good luck to you. </TEXT>

Next I'm going to step back and think--just like you're doing, about how my prior nonsense made her feel.  When I've established enough mental space around this, I'm going to suggest that we talk about how I must have made her feel when I did these things to her in the past because of how badly I felt.  Then I'm going to let it go.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made a decision this morning that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what--consistent with [the Baby Steps;](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  I went ot an AA meeting; I communicated with friends in my support network; and, even though I've had a pretty tough and anxious week I am going to bed sober.  If I thought there was any risk that I was going to drink tonight, I'd be in an AA meeting talking about it, but that's how I approach the issue.  I'm not going to throw away my continuous time sober because experience teaches me that no matter how bad I feel about anything if I don't drink it will get better.  This was true for me when I was in prison, this is true for me NOW. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently I've been reading a scholarly work, *A Natural History of Alcoholism, Revisted* by Dr. George Vaillant, a Harvard professor of psychiatry which makes the point about "alcoholism" that academic research supports the view that alcoholism (and by definition alcoholics) deal with a "unitary disorder" or disease.  It is a disorder of some complexity and that alcoholism is NOT a matter of binary diagnosis, e.g. you got it or you don't. Instead alcoholism is often a *matter of degree* a lot like heart disease, or a diabetes.  To call it a disease is to simply underscore that once an individual has lost the capacity consistently to control how much and how often he or she drinks there is a sufficient basis to conclude that they are alcoholic and that treating the conditions makes considerable practical sense.

I don't know if that all comes off as clearly as I can see it--maybe because I'm an old guy and I get this whole heart disease/diabetes metaphor.  I'm a diabetic.  Consistently food of all sorts push my "A1C" as found on daily blood tests into a range that my chronic disease endangers my health: eyesight, heart, and puts me at risk of neuropathies, and amputation loss of extremities.  I can remain healthy and live a full life if I make proper daily decisions about my diet and exercise.  When my diabetes blood-sugar is consistently in the normal range it's easy to think I'm not diabetic, but I am.  I'm not powerless over my disease and in fact I am RESPONSIBLE for self-treatment.

The same with my alcoholism.  I am a real alcoholic, I've proved that to my complete satisfaction.  I am not afraid of the word at all.  I find it empowering.  No physician ever diagnosed me as alcoholic, and despite my several decades of recovery in AA, no one in an AA meeting ever "labeled" me as alcoholic.  I can not consistently control how much or how often I drink, if I drink even one drink.  Recovery via AA has given me a whole new way of life, and it has helped me find a path through the chaos of my life.  Finally, I've been able to put to rest the debating society in my own head about who I am and what I am responsible for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 2001 I celebrated 15 years of continuous sobriety, but I felt as you are expressing in this post.  I felt like I had accomplished alot; I was sponsoring; professionally, I was doing the best work of my life and not enjoying the financial rewards that I felt like I was due; I was frequently enraged; and, finally, I relapsed.  The relapse miraculously ended in 2009. My [story is fairly well documented in the Saturday Share](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) so I won't repeat it here.  My lesson: give TIME, TIME.  They like to say in AA: "don't leave the room before the miracle occurs."  This advice in my experience is totally true.  It's harder, much harder to come back and dig out of the damage--but, miracles of change in the human experience happen around us all the time, and if we're patient, within, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is probably going to shock my friends on SD, but yes I believe that there are some people for whom controlled drinking works; but, I'm not that person.  Not only, am I not that person, I can't even get in the head of someone who would think controlled drinking is a good thing, although at one time I thought it would be nice to drink just fine wines--when I was in my pre-relapse home cooking phase and watching Food TV in the day when they had real cooking shows with teaching chefs.  The reality is that after 15 continuous years of sobriety my "controlled drinking" spun wildly out of control after about 2 weeks and then it took me 7 long hellish years to get back to recovery.  I have fully answered the question for myself--why would I want to?  I only ever wanted that elusive sensation that I got from drinking (or so I told myself) and after I relapsed, I discovered to my satisfaction that all I really ever could do was drink myself into stupor.  </TEXT>

I love AA and AA meetings, but over time--not drinking, actively listening, I learned who I should listen to, and who I could discount.  Believe it or not, after awhile, people I discounted started to make a bit more sense.  Funny, that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Respectfully, this is ridiculous; CLIMATE change and the POPE's encyclical is explicitly about current US Politics and if you don't know this fact you aren't reading US Politics.  Once again, this is why it's on the Washington Post's POLITICS and OPINION pages. I could have take a dozen other articles about current GOP presidential campaigns dealing "explicitly" with this encyclical.

I'm gonna grow and glow till I'm so blue pure perfect

I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face

I'm gonna kneel and pray every day last I should become vain along the way

I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord but I'm gonna be a diamond some day


I'm gonna learn the best way to walk gonna search and find a better way to talk

I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough edged self till I get rid of every single flaw

I'm gonna be the world's best friend gonna go round shaking everybody's hand

I'm gonna be the cotton pickin' rage of the age I'm gonna be a diamond some day

<TITLE> Dealing with a tough day | wet basement update </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-17 00:03:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here on the westside of Cleveland we have been in this wet weather loop for some days.  So the ground is saturated and where I live close to the edge of Lake Erie our storm sewers backed up and flooded our basement about 7:30 PM last night.  My son was temporarily residing down there and a lot of his belongings are lost.  Quick action saved it from being worse; but it's been stressful as I dealt with work, my son, the disaster clean up folks, the insurance company and the SO.  The pice de rsistance was when I jumped into the ice-cold shower at 5 AM because the flood knocked out the water heater.  I was able to successfully re-light the water heater before I went to SBUX to hang with the dude. 

So somewhat stressful day, but all in all it has worked out so far.  It worked out and I even got a bike ride in, met with some people on a work matter, and hung out on some on Reddit.  Compare and contrast with 6 years ago.  I would have absolutely exploded at the situation, resentfully responded to my poor family and probably sulked in my room sneak drinking.  Yikes.  

I am so glad I did not drink TODAY. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome /u/TZ840 to /r/stopdrinking -- yeah, I wouldn't worry about telling anybody for awhile unless it's smart because you want to keep booze out of the residence, e.g. the GF drinks.  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope something there will help you with "next steps."

Good luck and welcome aboard the lifeboat. </TEXT>

Also, having said that there is one character who goes off (like the guy you called) while most of us just roll our eyes.  In my experience of having been the secretary and chair of many AA meetings over the years and  bearing in mind that usually the secretary is deemed by the membership to be the "sickest" person-- leadership do NOT govern meetings, they are there to serve.  

BTW, here's an AA [position paper to professionals on our many paths.](http://www.aa.org/newsletters/en_US/f-13_winter09.pdf)

By the way, I doubt that I will ever drink again; but even now I haven't "quit drinking," instead I make a renewable decision every morning that I am not going to drink TODAY.  In other words, I stopped drinking one day at a time.  That works pretty well for me.  It works much better than all those sober years ago when I told myself that I had permanently "quit drinking." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally resembled that thinking process; until I stopped drinking and until I learned that sustained time stopped changed all of that into a process that looks something like this (sorry no pie graft):

Get up!  Make a decision not to drink TODAY.  Memorialize the decision by logging into the morning Check-in.  Do the simple things on my list for the day: coffee with friends read the New York Times; work, household chores, personal errands, recovery meetings;  improve my life.  Go to bed SOBER.  Repeat.  

The result is that my life when from ruination of health, wealth and reputation to a mainly happy, free and valued SOBER life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's where I was at 25 days in recovery: my wife was having an affair with her then (sociopath law partner); my daughter who was a high-school senior was newly pregnant; my son was trying out his gay-period as a high-school sophomore; and I would be going to federal prison for tax evasion.  In short we were living the whole dysfunctional American dream. 

Flash forward nearly 6 years: my wife and I fully reconciled (yeah, 27 year marriages are complex); my legal troubles are behind me (Orange is the New Black is my new fav Netflix series); my 41/2 year old grandson Riley is the light of my life; and, my son is knocking down theater awards including a rave review in today's paper for his "hilarious" performance as the Nazi playwright in the Producers.  

I'm sure what I'm saying is obvious: don't drink and life is one hell of an interesting adventure.  Even my feelings of betrayal and my broken heart healed with time.  Good luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True story: many years ago I had a client who was killed after being crushed by a casting at a steel factory when an overloaded crane collapsed.  Should have been a no-brainer workers' compensation death claim but on autopsy the pathology report noted 12 nanograms of THC.  The claim was disallowed because--my man was presumptively high.  I hired the leading expert in that era on the subject of THC intox who testified that he and other scientists tried to arrive at a scale of THC intox based on the blood-alcohol model and had utterly failed.  He indicated that there is no means of objectively measuring impairment from THC based on presence in the bloodstream.  I won my case.  Frankly, this should not have been an issue since my deceased worker was not involved in any operational respect as it related to the casting or crane that killed him, but why let a little logic get involved in depriving a widow of death benefits.

<TEXT> I've been to lots of AA meetings over almost 30 years; and, I've been to a few crazy meetings, too.  Usually, I need to stay attuned to "the winners."   There are always two types of examples in recovery: good examples and bad example, but even the bad examples can be good examples if you know how to unpack the meaning.  ; ) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I can't help but think that AA is doing me more harm than good, I do suffer from depression and AA seems to amplify that due to some of the self defeating and negative attitudes that go on in the room. I feel like I need self empowerment not self depreciation which I feel like is what some AA members preach.

I've never been to a meeting like this, let alone several meetings so that I felt that a pattern was emerging.  I have been in dark or depressed places where I had the reverse of rose-colored glasses on; and, I processed what I saw and what I heard in a way that lead me to believe as you seem to believe and which you ascribe as an AA message.  

But by all means, try a SMART recovery meeting!  I give you a lot of credit for persisting in seeking help.  Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We talk about this, but probably not enough.  I honestly can't think of a time in my drinking where I was happy with only one or two drinks or beers.  In fact given the choice during most of my drinking career between one drink or beer and not drinking at all--I'd usually not drink at all.  A single drink or two would simply set off cravings, make me uncomfortable, and make me more likely to flee a social situation to "feed my disease."  Personally a funny fact: I met my wife the night I was sitting at an upscale bar doing the crossword puzzle and drinking a diet coke.  I was "pacing" for that evening's drinking; it was far too early in the evening to do the kind of drinking I would end up doing that night.   </TEXT>

If I were thinking that way I'd be lost too.  But I don't think that way at all.  In fact despite 2000+ days of continuous sobriety I still do it one day at a time.

<TEXT> Good for you; hang tough.  It's worth it.  

Listen, if this were easy there would be no alcoholism.  Heavy or abusive drinkers would stop or moderate--end of story.  Instead we lose hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide directly to this disease.  If ebola did this to our populations we would be in a worldwide medical emergency and we'd recognize the seriousness of what we are grappling with in terms of a health crisis.

Here's what I can say from my personal experience: active alcoholism was killing me; and, sobriety is a beautiful alternative ALTHOUGH in the early days of sobriety it often doesn't feel that way.  It took time for my body and brain to recover and worse I continued to believe that I was missing out on the party.  That latter piece of the puzzle is particularly dark--because that message is my old alkie thinking in the throes of trying to send me back into my disorder.  My answer: don't drink TODAY and trust the experience of others that its well worth the struggle because it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a long time AA, I would encourage you to definitely make the effort to get to one of those agnostic/atheist meetings.  Perhaps you will find the person you think will be an ideal sponsor at one of those meetings.  In the interim I would for sure use the phone numbers and ask the same question you ask in this post to your friends.  Finally, pro-tip--when you connect with a running crowd of like-believers or non-believers you may well find a set of meetings that closely align with your belief or non-belief that are not advertised as agnostic/atheist meetings.  And, as you go along feel free to ask for help among your friends to start an agnostic/atheist meeting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I quit smoking cigarettes 23 years ago using willpower.  I lost 60 pounds using will power.  I trained and ran a marathon using will power.  But I could not recover from alcoholism through willpower.  I needed a power outside of myself.  I found that power outside myself in the fellowship of other people in recovery.  I accessed information about my underlying problems; I received explicit directions to address my issues connected with recovery; I was supported in success and failure; despairing I had phone numbers to call; I found positive social activities that did not involve my former drinking milieu; I found a road map through the chaos of my pass; I discovered a way to objectively check my condition and progress; and, I found a purpose for my life.  None of these things were available to me via my self-will or willpower.  These directions came from outside.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two things: 

1. I posted this in /r/law and /r/badlawyer yesterday; 

2. /r/politics deletes many of my links for myriad stupid reasons including my link to an article this morning where Scott Walker was called a liar by the British Prime Minister over false claims Walker made about President Obama.  "Off-topic."  A link to the endorsement of Rick Perry by the American Sniper widow was deleted as off-topic.  It's gotten to a point where most mods no longer bother to respond to my objections or inquiries.  The deletions are indefensible under their own rules. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly believe that those of us who KNOW for ourselves that we are alcoholic and that we should get help--have already taken the first 3 steps the day we walk through the doors of our first AA meeting.  I think that it's useful, though, to get a sponsor and "work through" every step with the sponsor even 1-3 at a pace most comfortable for you and the sponsor.  The "clean up steps" 4-9 are best addressed systematically over the course of the first and possibly second years.  I posted earlier in the week about a difficult financial amends with the IRS that I'm working on and I'm just a couple of months shy of 6 years if that gives you any idea of how these can take time.  Finally, all this work is about creating a blueprint for living your authentic life and helping others.  So 10, 11, and 12 are all about that aspect of your new life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue with human remains is fairly settled in most states (and to be clear, state not federal law governs this question).  The human corpse and its attendant organs are supposed to be the PROPERTY of the decedent's estate and thus belong to the executor or next of kin.  But the disposition of the body otherwise--i.e. the pathology, tissue donation, or errors in switching corpses have not successfully given rise to lawsuits.  

Frankly, I'm the OP of this link and an attorney and I mostly find the story interesting from the standpoint that nearly every aspect of "personhood" creates rights and remedies and this slightly ghoulish example was a colorful but not terribly important situation except to illustrate that outrage does not mean actionable lawsuit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of years ago I got into this discussion using the lifeboat metaphor.  For me, if I were drowning and I was thrown a lifeline about to be pulled aboard a lifeboat I KNOW I wouldn't question the belief system of my rescuers, but that's what we alcoholics seem to do  reflexively.  Of course, AA language has ingrained references to God and prayer--but the real solution in AA is built on 4 simple ideas:

1. Give the alcoholic a substitute for the dependence on booze;

2. Remind the alcoholic RITUALLY that even one drink will lead to pain and relapse;

3. Repair the social and medical damage that was done;

4. Restore self-esteem.

That is the point and the purpose of the 12 Steps.  AA is the simplest and most accessible model for achieving these 4 simple ideas IN MY EXPERIENCE.  BTW, I believe SMART Recovery and Rational Recovery are designed to do the same 4 things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at my home group Thursday night and after listening to the prayers and mentions of God, I made sure I said--if your new here (we always have new people at this meeting) you do not need to believe in God, or a higher power, or prayer.  You are welcome here.  No one will look down on you over your belief or non-belief.  

I hope that you will remember to do likewise when you feel strong enough and included-enough in your meetings to make sure the newcomers hear that message--the message of inclusion.  The only requirement for membership in AA is a desire to stop drinking and I'm personally glad you are giving it a shot.  Now having said all that -- I needed to get over myself and the notion that my objections to religious belief were an obstacle to my getting sober when in reality MY ego was my biggest obstacle.

Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes!  Social anxiety is a fairly normal part of early recovery.  Can you think of any reasons why apart from your individual psychological make up?  It's actually pretty simple if you think about it.  When we do drugs and alcohol we are intentionally cutting ourselves off from engagement with others.  Often we isolate in order to do whatever our drug or drugs of choice are--undisturbed by family, friends or acquaintances.  Now that we're sober we do the whole social thing without the aid of chemicals--it's like learning how to ride a bicycle in public without training wheels.  But guess what?  Training wheels are available at the closest AA meeting.  It's how I successfully reintegrated.  Don't be afraid to speak up--we want you to open your mouth and tell us your experience!  Someone in the room may need to hear what you have to say. </TEXT>

So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes in detail how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  Now let me be specific about getting away from beer.  When I make my conscious daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad, alcohol is out of my movie for the day, all day. This includes beer.  But let's go one baby step further--I need new friends, new situations and new activities BECAUSE I need to extinguish the old reinforcers--my beered-up buddies, bar rooms, and drinking activities.  For me this mean recovery, and AA was the easiest, most accessible route to recovery.  In doing this I needed to get rid of my preconceptions about what this might involve and dive in.  I did and it worked for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Agnostic 12 Steps:

1. We admitted we were powerless over alcoholthat our lives had become unmanageable.

2. Came to believe and to accept that we needed strengths beyond our awareness and resources to restore us to sanity.

3. Made a decision to entrust our will and our lives to the care of the collective wisdom and resources of those who have searched before us.

4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

5. Admitted to ourselves without reservation, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.

6. Were ready to accept help in letting go of all our defects of character.

7. With humility and openness sought to eliminate our shortcomings.

8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.

9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.

11. Sought through meditation to improve our spiritual awareness and our understanding of the AA way of life and to discover the power to carry out that way of life.

12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. </TEXT>

I think it's a pretty common experience in recovery that at some early point--if we are sincere--we find that we have become new people.  We start to live with a new purpose to become who we thought we might be. We become interested in passions and interests that we dreamed we do someday if we could ever get off the bar stool or out of the club.

<TEXT> Unfortunately, it was a widely-held belief that the alcoholic was immoral--if only he would take "the pledge" or "get religion."  The failure to make the choice not to drink was seen as sin.  It really wasn't until the late 19th century (Rush, Trotter 1760-1832) that a practical "disease model" and treatment emerged (Keely) although it was not widely known or accepted.  The modern recovery  movement begins as a radical reaction to the WCTU and the moral choice models--fully accepting the disease model of alcoholism.  Frankly, the anti-AA ideologues are actually preaching a moral choice model--without the moral-ism.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I remember that neuro-feedback loop when I was drinking.  When I went back to "moderate drinking" after 15 continuous years of sobriety I thought of course that I could sip fine wines.  I'd buy these $100+ bottles of aged port and I'd have the appropriate crystal glasses.  Of course, being an alcoholic, I'd hide all of my apparatus in crawl spaces and wait till everyone else in the house was asleep and pull out my port and sip my wine--inevitable waking up at 5 AM laying on the floor with empty bottles of port that I must have swilled down.  Did I need any more proof of my powerlessness?  And yet, I went on and on for 7 long hellish years. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In a discussion sometime last year, I told my pal, /u/offtherocks, about the great 19th Century English novelist Anthony Trollope who in 1858 published [Doctor Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Thorne) which deals with the multiple episodes in the lives of recurring characters in something called the Barchester Chronicles.  If you are at all interested in literature, I can't recommend them highly enough.  In *Doctor Thorne* the title character treats the alcoholism of his friend Sir Roger Scatcherd who eventually dies from the disease.  

 But be this as it may, be it true or false that Sir Roger was most efficacious when in his cups, there can be no doubt that he could not wallow for a week in brandy, six or seven times every year, without in a great measure injuring, and permanently injuring, the outward man. Whatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the inner mindsymposiums indeed they were not; posiums I will call them, if I may be allowed; for in latter life, when he drank heavily, he drank alonehowever little for evil, or however much for good the working of his brain might be affected, his body suffered greatly. It was not that he became feeble or emaciated, old-looking or inactive, that his hand shook, or that his eye was watery; but that in the moments of his intemperance his life was often not worth a day's purchase. The frame which God had given to him was powerful beyond the power of ordinary men; powerful to act in spite of these violent perturbations; powerful to repress and conquer the qualms and headaches and inward sicknesses to which the votaries of Bacchus are ordinarily subject; but this power was not without its limit. If encroached on too far, it would break and fall and come asunder, and then the strong man would at once become a corpse.  p.124

And here, Scatcherd on his death bed describing his fears relating to the effect of the disease upon his heir, Louis:

 "With my poor boy; with Louis."

 "If he [Louis] will let me, I will [look after him,]" said the doctor.

 "And, doctor, when you see a glass at his mouth, dash it down; thrust it down, though you thrust out the teeth with it. When you see that, Thorne, tell him of his fathertell him what his father might have been but for that; tell him how his father died like a beast, because he could not keep himself from drink."

 These, reader, were the last words spoken by Sir Roger Scatcherd. As he uttered them he rose up in bed with the same vehemence which he had shown on the former evening. But in the very act of doing so he was again struck by paralysis, and before nine on the following morning all was over.

In the characters and story of Doctor Thorne and Sir Roger Scatcherd I was struck at how sophisticated Trollope's 1858 understanding of the psychology of the alcoholism and the sufferer's powerlessness over the malady.  Also the powerlessness of that caring physician to help his friend. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Life on Life's Terms | Clearing away the wreckage of my past </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-10 02:30:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I got sober in 2009 after a 7 year relapse, as I saw it, I had the choice of killing myself and avoiding what was certain to be professional disgrace and a criminal prosecution over unfiled and unpaid federal income taxes or get sober and face the music.  In the years of my relapse the income from my professional practice was on a roller coaster.  Some years, I barely made any income and in at least one of those years I made a million dollars.  The unpaid and unfilled taxes were an abyss that I could not figure out how to address despite numerous false starts--of course, not being in recovery I had intentionally walked away from ready and willing help and support.  Finally I was at "fuck it, I'll just sit here and drink."  

Ultimately I suffered very serious professional and criminal consequences that included federal prison time. Some of the damages to my reputation and professional status (I lost my license) were permanent, but the criminal consequence has been long in my rear view mirror.  

When you own taxes in the US you might find that you owe reasonably $300,000 dollars and then through some black magic the IRS says your $300,000 indebtedness is now $600,000 and then time passes, even with payments and forfeitures, the IRS says you now owe $900,000 which is sort of where I find myself now.  In other words, my sole criminal offense resulting in a short prison sentence has become a life sentence as it relates to intractable debt and IRS collection activities including garnishments and seizures.  

When the collections nightmares first got underway the local agent that I dealt with suggested that I file something called an Offer In Compromise (OIC).  An OIC is a whole lot more than calling the IRS up and saying--here's a few thousand send me a release,  In 2012 I undertook the process and I was very close to accomplishing a deal when mysteriously (a common experience when dealing with the IRS) the rug was ripped out from underneath me. 

Leaving out lots and lots of the details, I determined to find out why.  I submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and I got my entire IRS file.  As a result I learned that the former criminal investigator in my underlying criminal case supplied misinformation which if I had had an opportunity to address I would have been able to supply documentation refuting allegations he made that disqualified me.  

Flash forward, to now, I just completed all the hoops, and I am greelighted to submit a new OIC (now complete) which my accountant believes stands a chance of success based on revised rules adopted by the IRS in 2014.  Also my employer is supplying funds to effect a deal if it can be done.

I write about this to let you know that I too struggle with life on life's terms and I don't drink TODAY no matter how frustrating, confusing, depressing, anxious painful or embarrassing those terms are.  I doggedly persist every day that I am SOBER which means, I still stand a chance.  Five years sober and I am still working on clearing away the wreckage of my past.  

tl;dr  CC has bad, bad tax problems; he doesn't drink; he overcomes obstacles; and, he hope that he may finally be able to clear away financial wreckage of the past.

Note: This was painful to write, but I promised to update a comment about my resolution and determination to deal with this issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) is a post that I published in several versions.  It's made up of information that helped me stop drinking and get sober + ideas suggested from among others, /u/offtherocks.  My pal, /u/Flow_Morpheous_Flow noticed a typo so with the need to make that slight revision I added a link to the daily check-in, too.  

So if you're **new here** I hope you will consider making the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and [the Daily Check-in](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/checkin) part of your Stop Drinking routine. </TEXT>
