<TEXT> I had an ex do me one better. We had a birthday, anniversary, Christmas happening 3 consecutive months. 

I bought her a flatscreen tv, 2 purses (LV   Coach), a bed room set, took her on a snowboarding trip to mammoth, bought her full snowboard, boots, bindings, clothing for the trip. 

She waits until after NYE to break up with me because we had plans to go to Vegas.

I spoke with a close friend after, who told me my ex was cheating on me for about a year, but my friend didn't want to say anything to me because she thought I looked happy, and she didn't want to be the one to break up a happy relationship.

Yay me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a few British friends and at first I would talk politely with them and, to me, it would sound like they were being polite with me.

But they would laugh to themselves at certain things they would say. Or after I said certain things.

After a while I came to realize that they were making fun of me and I had not even realized it. The sarcastic fucks! 

Some of the slang they used were unfamiliar to me, so that could have made things more difficult for me to understand.

Needless to say, we get along better, but I know them for the sarcastic, wankers they really are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came here to suggest this. /u/Nukemi

By far the easiest option that would provide you with hundreds of thousands of songs. And it's relatively inexpensive. 

You can take any and all song requests all night.

Things you need:

- Djay app 

- Spotify premium

- Apple computer or laptop

- Reliable internet connection

- Compatible hardware controller

If you already have cdj 2000nxs and a mixer, you're good to go. If not you can buy an inexpensive controller, like the Pioneer DDJ-WeGO3 which is about $300. (You can always return it after the gig)

Good luck and have fun! Remember, the night isn't about you or your ability to dj, it is about the bride   groom, and what their guests want to hear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very accurate depiction of what I observe on a daily basis. I'm from the newest generation of workers, fresh out of college with a results oriented culture and I work at a government agency where there's a lot of bureaucracy.

People are lazy, incompetent, and inefficient. It's just the culture here. I tried to outshine other peers when I started here but it was met with a negative response. I was seen as over stepping my bounds. It's all about seniority here. It's not about how much work you do but about how long you've been here.

<TEXT> I think you missed the point. The original post was about replacing a flat tire. Most people would just use the car jack. Using a jack stand to replace a flat shouldn't be necessary since you shouldn't be under the car while replacing a flat anyway.

Any time you are underneath the car, it is crucial to use jack stands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I limit myself to drinking only on the weekends (2 days). So I don't keep track of my carbs very closely on those days. 

I figure if I'm going to drink I might as well enjoy myself. Sorry, I don't have any accurate numbers for carb comparison for you.

I did a Google search and for 12oz of St. Bernardis I'm seeing 20-30g of carbs. That's no where near the 3g of carbs from Michelob ultra, but the choice for me is piss water vs. something I like to drink.

Edit: I scanned the bar code on a 12oz shock top just for fun. My fitness pal lists the following: 168cal, 15g carbs, 2g protein. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to offer an alternative train of thought. 

I drink beers with the highest alcohol content I can find. Gulden Drak, St. Bernardis ABT. 12, Delerium Tremens, La Fin Du Monde, are a few of my favorites.

They are all close to 9-10% abv. I would rather drink less beer with higher alcohol content than drink low carb beer, but end up drinking more. Added benefit, the beers are much better tasting and because I'm drinking less fluid overall, I feel less bloated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for taking the time to respond.

To answer your question about my goal weight. At 164lbs with 18% bf I have about 29lbs of fat. At my GW of 160lbs with 12% bf, I'll have about 19lbs of fat.

So my transition from 164lbs to 160lbs would involve losing fat at the same time, gaining muscle. Not a huge weight difference but my body composition would change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, I've been doing keto for about 2 months now and have stumbled upon /r/ketogains 

I'm trying to get some more muscle definition and size but I'm unsure if my current method is the most efficient.

Right now, I'm working out about 4 days a week (mostly lifting). I'm on a 18% calorie deficit. I've noticed some size and definition but from reading around, I can only surmise that this may be "noob gains." 

It makes sense to me that in order to gain muscle, you have to eat more calories than you expend, so those calories can go towards muscle growth (to put it in very simplified terms, I know it's more complicated than that).

I noticed also though, that I've begun to plateau as far as seeing the quick results as I did from the beginning. Can I have some feedback? I'm worried if I eat at a surplus, I will gain fat as well (along with muscle, hopefully).

Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle while on a caloric deficit? Or should I bulk and then cut?

<TEXT> I have a ddj sx for home use and it's more than capable of serving my needs. 

The only down side is that it requires a laptop and Serato. 

It's time consuming enough to keep your music collection updated and organized in Serato, but you would have to prep your tracks again in rekordbox if you want to use them with cdjs.

If you're set on a controller, I would recommend the xdj rx. It's a standalone unit that doesn't require a laptop. It uses rekordbox so you just have to manage one music collection. It has the stacked wave forms (Which I think is the major advantage of software driven setups).

<TEXT> Not sure why people are hating on your nice mattress. 

Your debt shouldn't be that difficult to overcome. Like others have stated, get your spending under control. Plan to "disappear" from the social even for at least 6 months. Find a hobby that costs little money. I'd suggest done self improvement, like working out.

This way when you get home from work, you have your obligation to go work out and you won't be tempted by vices, such as going out.

Budget as much of your income as you can to paying off the credit card. And I mean actually sit down and draft a budget.

In 6 to 8 months you'll have made a significant dent in your debt and you'll be a healthier you. </TEXT>

I always post pictures of bacon, steaks, korean bbq, and other "fattening" foods on instagram. When people ask how I stay slim, I tell them it's because I eat bacon all day, everyday.

<TEXT> If it's very minor damage then you'll be lucky if your insurance company can get his insurance to pay for a new hood and bumper. More than likely, it will be a repaint.

You need to call your insurance company and tell them what happened. 

You should go to at least 3 body shops to get an estimate on repairs. Estimates are free. I would suggest going to the most expensive body shops you can find. A higher estimate is in your favor.

Once fault is determined, your insurance company will offer 2 ways to receive payment: either they cut the check to the body shop that you fix your car at or they issue you a check.

I would choose to take the check personally. Then go to any body shop and have them repair the car.  </TEXT>

Air filter?  Screw driver?  

Last time I checked,  you don't need an air filter for an oil change.  Maybe you meant oil filter?

You have the job now, it pays well, stay with it since it makes more sense financially. You always have the option to go to college later on.

Not having a degree won't impact your hireability (is that a word?) since you'll have your work experience to back you up.

To paraphrase a friend. 
   You may be a college graduate applying for the entry level manager position, but the guy that dropped out of high school to work for the company, applying for the same position, has 6 years experience on you and he already works there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just curious as to what equipment you've been using to mix or practice on that you don't know how to to set up your laptop.

Just a word of warning, set up a time before your gig so you can hook up all your equipment and make sure it works. A few days before the gig if possible, sinceb it sounds like you don't even have all the equipment you think you need. 

I'd also have a back up plan, like having a bunch of tracks prepped on a USB drive in case you can't hook up your laptop. I'd suggest setting them up in rekordbox if you're using CDJ's.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> People who work there are empowered to take care of the customer as they deem fit. It won't hurt the bottom line much if you realize just how many drinks get thrown out in a day.

Also, giving away a drink and then having that person, most likely, share their experience with friends or on social media is probably one of the cheapest (and most effective) type of marketing they can buy.

<TITLE> American Bartenders - What do you deem is an appropriate amount to tip per drink? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-03 17:52:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some ways I've seen people tip:

* $1 per drink, regardless of price or effort.

* $1 per drink for drinks that only require pouring (ex. beer, a shot, a glass of wine, etc.)

* $1 per drink, and will increase with difficulty/complexity of drink being made. (Usually an arbitrary amount decided by the patron).

* Percentage of total (usually 20%).

**Bartenders:** How much do you expect to be tipped? What is the amount of tip that can be left, where you will still feel stiffed, even though a tip was left? Do you ever feel that, due to slow service or messing up an order, you deserved a lower than normal tip?

**Bar patrons:** How much do you tip your bartender and what is your reasoning behind it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's say you borrow 100k and end up not paying for it. The company that you borrowed money from would rather get some money than no money, so they sell your 100k debt to a collection agency for 10k. 

Now the collection agency "owns" your debt of 100k and can come after you for that amount. Since they only paid 10k for your 100k worth of debt, they may try to offer you a "deal" by saying they will settle with you for 50k. 

If you end up paying the 50k, you think you have a good deal and the collection company makes away with a cool 40k profit. 

This is how many private loans and credit cards work.

<TEXT> The people telling you that you can sell your car with a blown engine for anything more than a few hundred dollars are deluded or misguided. 

Try to get as much from the mechanic as you can and just take his settlement. Don't keep the car to try and sell because it will be more trouble than it's worth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it probably sucks right now but you have to look at this in perspective with your whole life. You sound like a young guy so you should have many years ahead of you. This event in your life is rather small compared to your whole life. 

Learn from this and grow from this. They're not worth your trouble being bitter over this. Think about what you gained: the knowledge that life does go on after a "serious" relationship. You got rid of 2 shitty people in your life.

<TEXT> It's very difficult to "force" genres on anybody. Especially when it's something as subjective as music.

You should try to stay true to music you enjoy or you'll find that you get bored very quickly. 

Try building your own following and then try finding some underground promo groups that like dnb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, I know exactly what you mean by being cliquey. You just have to put in time and get to know them without actively trying to get a gig with them. Build the relationship first before trying to ask for a gig. It's also difficult if they don't like the genre you play. You might as well go another route if that's the case. 

About the cd thing. I find it more effective than telling people to visit your SoundCloud  (or whatever). Because let's face it, how many times have you met a dj that you liked and then remembered to visit there page the next day? Now imagine a dj you don't know asking you to visit their page. You'd probably politely say yes, but never comply. If you hand them a cd with your info on it, they might actually listen to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I make the same observations as you. I know a lot of mediocre djs who shamelessly promote themselves online and have managed to garner a decent following. I say shamelessly because their mixes range from awful to decidedly mediocre, yet their audience does not seem to mind, and neither do they. Maybe the audience is not knowledgeable enough to discern the mistakes?

Out of respect for myself and the art of djing, I hesitate to release mixes that contain amateurish mistakes such as trainwrecks, extended periods of off-key mixing,  or uneven eq-ing of tracks.

I'm not any way hating on them. We all have to start somewhere. I like to think that they don't know they are bad because they are ignorant to what "good" is. They don't even know that they don't know. 

I think if your goal is to dj to a larger crowd then you have to market yourself. Create an online presence, network with other djs and promoters, attend club events and mingle with the crowd, pass out demo cds. If you are as good as you say you are, naturally you will gain a following because you are offering a superior product compared to the other (worse) djs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the clitoris is so sensitive, Brandon says, she sees women being more specific about their preferences for how they want to be touched. "[Men] rarely tell me, 'She touches too hard, too soft, she tickles, her hands are cold.' Women say those things all the time about how men touch their vulvas, clitorises included. Women are finicky, and so are their clitorises." 

Men rarely say anything to women because they're either too shy or too awkward to voice their concerns or they think criticizing the way a womam touches their penis will discourage further handjobs.

Well, I'll do a service for most men by saying: Most women's handjob technique is horrible! Guys, speak up and tell your women how to properly give handjobs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on your diet but if you're on a ketogenic diet,  I find that hunger is not a huge issue. 

The ketogenic diet trades out your dependency on carbs and forces your body to use fats for energy.  I eat foods high in fat and stay away from carbs. I find that hunger strikes less often and I can go longer between meals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was old enough to realize that the teachings I was receiving in bible class were hard to believe. Upon questioning them I was only given circular arguments which basically boiled down to, "we are adults and we know more than you, so listen to us."

In my middle school years I learned more about history. I learned about how past civilizations had gods for things in nature that they didn't understand and couldn't explain (Roman god of the sun, etc.) We look back on it now and think they were silly for having a god if the sun or god of the sea, yet we (organized religion) have a god that created the universe, since we can't explain that (yet).

<TEXT> Well, anything that breaks the ice, leading to conversation is always a good start.

I wouldn't say it was the most effective way to pick up girls; that's entirely up to how well the resulting conversation goes combined with her actual interest in you.

They were a good ice breaker is what you meant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends on the crowd and what he "thinks" the crowd is receptive to. I was at a private show he did in Hollywood last weekend and he stated that he was playing a Perfecto Dark set but the crowd was a bunch of hipsters who barely even knew who he was. 

Only about 3 tracks in, he started to progressively get more mainstream with a more "pop" sound. The last song, all the hipsters jumped up and sang along to. I had no idea what song it was. So as a DJ he completed his job to get the party going, but I can't say I enjoyed his set much.

TL;DR He will play what the crowd is receptive to, whether it be pop or more underground. </TEXT>
