<TITLE> Koji Suzuki "S" English Translation? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 17:36:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just finished Ring, Spiral, and Loop and loved them all.

For those unfamiliar, the first book, "Ring", is what the movie "The Ring" is based on. It's horror, and fantastic.

The follow-ups, however, Spiral and Loop, are actually sci-fi novels. I wasn't expecting that transition, but really enjoyed them as they were thought-provoking -- great stories in their own right.

After finishing Loop I learned that Suzuki wrote a follow-up called "S" but that this has not been translated to English. I emailed the publisher of the previous novels to see if there are plans for a translation, but have not heard back.

Do any of you have any idea if this will happen and when?

If you have not read this series, I highly recommend it. </TEXT>

I'm looking to join a health club, and the woolen mill is very close to me, so I'm thinking about that one.

Some questions for anyone who might be a member:
- What times are the busiest? Are there any times after work (5) that are not so busy?
- What are the people like?
- What do you think of the facility?
- How crowded is the pool?

Thanks redditors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've posted on here before about how lucky I am that Excedrin works for me.  One of the components is caffeine.

When I've been in season I have drank coke or coffee as a preventative. It does help some people, so I'm not surprised.

I get a warning as well, which tells me to do something, mine is pain and tightness in a lump at the back of my neck, which I've heard isn't uncommon to have in sufferers. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do I need to be at 20g of carbs? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-02 00:34:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi r/keto,

I'm new to the keto-way and have a question that I hope someone can answer.

Short background: I'm not looking to lose weight, just my gut. I work out, but my gut is stubborn and doesn't seem to want to shrink. I thought lowering my carbs might help.

So, do you think I need to hit 20g to see the benefits? Can I just reduce my carbs, but maybe go for 40g?

I read this "Another method is to choose a carb goal between 15-50g/day (20g is a good starting point)" in the Gdoc, which got me wondering how important that 20g is as a milestone.

Any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When "in season" (that's what I would call when I was having the stretch of time when I was getting them since they were seasonal) or during the chronic phase I was always tired. After an attack especially. If I had one during the day, which wasn't uncommon, I was a zombie for the remainder.

I wouldn't drink when I was in season, since alcohol is a trigger. Having a drink at lunch was a sure way to hell. Having a consistent sleep pattern was important, and even felt like if I exercised too much, or did anything that might through the pattern off (like a nap), the attacks were somehow worse.

Through some of this time I was married (divorced now), and my wife was very helpful. She would get ice for my head, massage my neck, whatever I needed. There were times when we had company and an attack came, and I would go hide for a while. I would emerge and say I wasn't feeling well, and probably seemed very off.

I've been very private about the headaches, very few people know about them (not even my parents or brother do), as I don't like bothering people with it. There's pros and cons to that. The attacks are ugly, it's not something I want anyone to see or worry about. But then, in season, I would go about life with what felt like a shadow following me, waiting to strike, and obviously no one would know what I was going through.

Not sure what else you might be looking for. Happy to help in any way I can, especially since I've wanted to get into film myself :)

<TEXT> I got my first migraine in the middle of my green belt testing in Tae Kwon Do (at about 25), and had no idea what was going on with my head and had no experience with these kinds of headaches. I managed to get through it by running to the bathroom and drenching my head in cold water.

After that I got a number more that week, and so went to the doctor's. After a number of tests was diagnosed with migraines.

But they very quickly changed.

One night I woke up and the headache was markedly different. It crept up from the back of my neck, the left side, up through the top and side, then to my eye. That knife in the eye and side feeling. The pain was unbelievable. I couldn't do anything but clutch my head, squeeze it, and cry out.

Those continued nightly and so I kept a journal to try and figure out what was going on. The pattern became obvious, they were seasonal. I generally got them 3 months on and 3 months off. After researching, I discovered clusters and it was a match.

I went through a chronic stage for a couple of years, the headaches daily. However, I'm EXTREMELY lucky in that Excedrin actually works for me, if I take it early enough. I typically get a sign that one is coming by a unique pain in the back of my neck, where I have a very noticeable lump, which I hear isn't uncommon for clusterheads.

After the chronic stage it was back to seasonal. Then went a number of years without any at all. For the past few months, though, I've been getting them seemingly randomly.

Good luck with your film, and keep us updated on it. I'd love to see it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Guys, we need to talk about Tannehill...again </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-29 14:44:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As the submitter of this post I felt the need to circle back:  http://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/2h3aa1/guys_we_need_to_talk_about_tannehill/

As someone who was skeptical of Tannehill, I have to say that the past couple of months have changed my mind, and I believe it is because he has actually improved.

His accuracy does seem better, even on the long ball. I've seen just as many long passes just dropped as I've seen possibly bad throws.

We've talked a lot about how bad our o-line is, but every game that goes by I'm thankful that it's Tannehill at the QB position. Other quarterbacks would turn to jelly. Remember Carr? He became shell-shocked from being sacked so much in his early career. We are very lucky that Tannehill, somehow, manages to improve while having literally 2 seconds to make a decision before being clobbered.

Yesterday's perfect passer rating by Geno Smith (jesus that was hard to write) makes it clear we have a lot to work on on defense, but priority 1 still has to be the offensive line. Tannehill needs the time to throw. Not only is he still towards the top in terms of sacks, but even when he isn't he is throwing the ball in what looks like a frenzied black friday at Wal-Mart scene. It looks less and less to me like Tannehill is holding on too long, and more like he is constantly pressured. Yes, moving around the pocket can help, but the line needs to improve too.

Anyway, I'm pumped in what I've seen from Tannehill the past couple of months and am looking forward to having him as our QB. I'm on the fence about Philbin, I don't see him as a winner, but that is what it is.

Lastly, and no offense, but "the Passmaster" just doesn't do it for me. I think another nickname is needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please not Jim Harbaugh! I know the appeal because he goes in and wins for a couple of seasons, but the trend with him is he starts to really get under the skin of those around him. Long term it isn't worth it. I've other people give excuses about media hype, but where there's smoke there's fire.

I would be really disappointed to see him come to the Dolphins. </TEXT>

I get warnings too, as long as I'm awake for them, but nothing like yours -- it doesn't seem to affect my coherence.

When I do get the warnings I've found that caffeine helps reduce the severity significantly and even prevent it from occurring (I'm very lucky in this way). I will use Excedrin or soda for the caffeine.

I kept a journal when I first started getting them which helped me identify triggers, patterns, etc.

Hope that helps. Have to be honest, the affecting your coherence is concerning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was one who created a thread on Tannehill last week.

My thoughts if you care: Tannehill played much better (that pass of Hartline is something rare from him and was good to see), BUT this was against one of the worst teams in the league who haven't been home since before the week 3 game.

Tannehill has to put more than one good game together. I remember his first ever games as a Dolphin and the number of balls batted...then what do we see in year 3? Same thing. The guy needs to improve.

So, good game, I'm glad for it...but let's keep in mind who it was against and see how he does the rest of the year. </TEXT>

<TITLE> First cluster in years </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-27 22:36:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Probably 16 years ago (I'm 39 now) I started getting clusters.  Seasonal at first then chronic for about 2 years, followed by seasonal again.

Then nothing for ~6 years. 

I woke up at about 5 this morning as a cluster was developing. Now, of course, I'm both spent and worried they are returning.

Not sure why I'm writing this. I've never spoken to anyone else who had clusters. But, as someone recently divorced I don't have anyone to share it with.

I've always considered myself lucky with clusters as I quickly recognized things that brought them on, early signs of one coming, and had things that helped reduce their ferocity.

Anyway, my thoughts go out to all of you. I hope you're successful in getting through your headaches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's how I feel too. We'll hover around 6-10 to 9-7, which means never getting the best QB in the draft. I don't follow college ball that closely, so I don't know how this class, or the next, is shaping up but Hickey better be paying attention.

Also very curious what Marino thinks at this point. He seemed high on Tannehill for a while, but after the past few games and now actually having an official role in the organization, I have to wonder what he thinks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard the same things about Dalton, but also watched a few Cincy games. He was managing the games well, and taking them to the playoffs.

Then there's Tanny...

I'm not totally dismissing our QB, we clearly have other issues (Coyle...damn man, really?) but I'm also done defending him with things like "well our oline has issues" because he's not doing his part either from what I see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I've been a Dolphins fan since Marino's trip to the Super Bowl. I've shared your struggles. Your hopes. I've fucked the Jets.

If you're like me, you saw a lot in Tannehill that you liked and were hopeful that he was the answer at quarterback.

But the more I watch, the more I see a guy who is just really average. He holds onto the ball too long. He has opportunities to gain some yardage on the ground, but that clock in his head doesn't seem to be working.

Trent Green was annoying during the Bills game talking about accuracy, but it's an issue. He isn't very good at hitting receivers down the field. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but every time he chucks it deep I hold my breath.

Our receivers are not an excuse. Yes we have dropped balls, but we are far better off than many teams in terms of receiver talent. And the drops...well, some of them the balls are not ideally placed. Yes, they should still be caught, but Tannehill is a part of that as well.

I hate to say it, brothers, but I think we're in for a rough ride. Get ready for a couple years of mediocrity as the organization realizes he's not the answer. Then there's maybe a house cleaning again.

Downvote me if you must. I'll be very happy to be proved wrong.

<TEXT> I'm a day late but hoping someone can help.

Here's my situation (Drupal 6). I have a content type with a number of fields, and views to display those fields in a table.

Let's say I have a field "Fruit" and a field "Vegetable", and a view "Food" that lists these fruit and vegetable fields in a column.

What I would like is php code at the top with would count the number of instances of each type of food.

For example, at the top it might show:
Apple: 4
Orange: 5
Celery: 3
etc..

Essentially it is counting the number of times "Apple" appeared in the "Fruit" column/field within that view. Same for Orange and Celery.

Is there php code that would do that?

Any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

If other survivors aren't paying attention to their teammates then being overwhelmed can happen fairly easily. 

That's actually my biggest frustration with multiplayer and this game. It's such a well done co-op that if your mates aren't helping each other you're doomed -- so newbie players can really drag the game down. This is why there are so many kicks. It's better to have a bot than someone not helping and doing their own thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a common tactic in the software industry, not just gaming. You release your product knowing there are likely things to fix, and your users help identify those.

On some level I agree. Companies should put in the effort to properly test and correct first. The flip side, though, is even then they wouldn't catch everything. Some ingenious gamer will find an exploit, or the sheer volume of players would identify one, or a glitch.

All that said, the melee buffer made the game more realistic and enjoyable IMHO. The game is very focused on balance, and infinite melee was an unfair advantage as seen by the majority of players. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, Seddit, I could use some help.

First, been divorced for about a year, 38 years old. I've been working on "me" by exercising regularly which has helped me feel better about myself. In general, I do feel pretty good (at least I think so). I have a good job, intelligent enough, I've been told I'm attractive, and in ok shape (not where I'd like to be yet). I am tall and thin.

From my experiences with online dating so far, I feel there's a huge plus for men with interesting and exciting lives or hobbies, but that's not my life right now. I work, go home, exercise, eat, sleep, repeat. Due to the divorce I don't have much money for other things (even though I make good money).

Conversely, I really like spending time with women (sure, no fucking surprise there) and would be pretty darn happy just "hanging out" with a girlfriend. I don't feel the need for dynamic events or activities.

There's one woman I've been seeing periodically, but due to conflicting schedules I don't see her much. And given my desire for meaningful human contact, this can cause some anxiety -- but no way in hell am I having the "define our relationship" talk.

I could use a few things from the generous souls here.
1) A fucking pep talk. Not being with someone can make me feel pretty down, which admittedly is a part of my problem.
2) Some ideas for cheap but exciting hobbies.
3) Help me deflate my approach anxiety by giving me ideas on the easiest places and ways to approach women. If I start there maybe everywhere else will become easier.

Appreciate it gents.

<TEXT> Hi all,

I've never owned a gun and am considering purchasing this: http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/firearms/rifles/umarex-h-k-mp5a5-22lr-2245250.html

I'm not looking to hunt, just go shooting at the range with a rifle. While I'm not picky, I'd like it to look cool - lame I know, but it's my first gun, cut me some slack :)

Ammo for this is 22 which my understanding can be challenging to get, but I feel it's doable in my area (Vermont) enough that it wouldn't be an issue. I wouldn't go to the range but once or twice a month at the most.

So, is this a good rifle? What's the quality like?

Thanks for any help to a newbie. </TEXT>

If you're into the movement to ficus locally (rather than chain restaurants, and mass produced everything) you'll fit in.

If you want Broadway, big city, national sports, long warm days, then you'll probably hate it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help: Property sale as settlement in 2013 for divorce finalized in 2014 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-03 17:27:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To make it quick and hopefully easy to understand (and I REALLY appreciate any help):

1) Sold real estate in August of 2013. The sale was a part of a divorce settlement.
2) The divorce is actually finalized in 2014.

My understanding is I won't be taxed on the profits of that sale since it was a settlement (the money is ultimately going to the ex wife).

Is this correct?

Thanks again for any help.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Add a speed bag to a Bowflex Body Tower </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-21 00:55:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit DIY,

I'm not that handy...so help with this is appreciated.

I want a speed bag (you know, boxing...) but I don't want to drill into my wall or buy a more expensive free standing one. I do, however, already own a Bowflex Body Tower (http://www.amazon.com/Bowflex-BodyTower/dp/B006353HCE) so I thought it could be possible to add one to it.

Note that I am 6'2" and the Body Tower is just taller than I by about 2 inches, so I need to account for that when adding the bag. 

Another requirement is that I want to be able to remove the speed bag appendage when I want to use the tower.

Ideas? Probably a weird request, I know, but I really appreciate any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not taking it as a put down, criticism is important.

1) it's a small state (Vermont) that I would do this in, so I feel like it's feasible to promote them internally and to visitors.

2) I own a number of premium local domain names that I would build sites on to promote all of the restaurants on (sites would have to be established first), and build relationships with other media outlets to promote them in exchange for online advertising.

3) I see the cost to the restaurants as that 12% (10% to the customer, 2% to the credit card company) with my 1% coming from the credit card. Yes, that's lower revenue for the credit card company, but in exchange for hopefully increased usage of the card.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Credit Card that offers discounts at local businesses where I get a small cut. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

I think I've seen others do this, but am finding it hard to find information on where to start.

To make a long story as short as possible, I'd like to start a business where I provide people with a credit card dedicated to local restaurants. If you use that card in one of the participating restaurants you get a small discount (let's say 10%, and in return the restaurant gets promoted through the program) and I would receive a small percentage of the transaction fee (1%).

Is this possible? Are there resources online on how to build this program with a credit card company?

Thanks for any assistance! </TEXT>

You don't just hire based on need, you have to look at the market. If a **proven** GM knocked on Ross' door and said "Give me the power, I'll give you a Super Bowl" he'd probably do it. </TEXT>

You have to wonder how this sets up Philbin for next year. A GM may come in with a promise to keep Joe for at least a year, but you know he'll be heavily scrutinized, as will RT. So much for consistency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a lawyer, but this might help:

"Section 230 of the CDA specifically addresses the nature of information ownership by online users. The Section states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

Generally speaking, Section 230 protects website administrators from being held accountable for information posted by other users. The CDA is a federal initiative, which means that Section 230 trumps any state or local laws to the contrary."

From http://www.brand.com/review-sites.html

My work is entirely online. These threats happen. You could represent yourself and present this CDA. But again, I'm not a lawyer so do your due diligence.


Edit: Your site is being spammed by SEOs. They are commenting in order to leave links to their own websites. I highly recommend you turn off the ability of users to link. This will reduce the garbage on your site (thus making it better for your users) and reduce the threat of Google filtering it out of the search results (and then no one finds it). As an example, look at the link by "garbage disposal" on the front page currently, it links to a website. Don't allow that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is probably the best article on the situation. I've defended Ireland in the past, and feel he does a very good job on the draft. This past off season, however, was a disaster. It's easy look back and say this (hindsight being 20/20), but Ireland should have known better. 

When was the last time a team made wholesale changes to their roster like we did? When has that worked? I remember the Redskins (maybe the 90s) making a number of changes and they won the Super Bowl, but they brought in proven and trusted vets, not a WR who was a bit of a diva, linebackers (don't get me wrong, I think Ellerbe and Wheeler are very good) and OLs who are still green.

This will continue to affect us. Next year won't be good either unless some leaders are brought in or miraculously emerge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mike Sherman is not the problem.

1) Tannehill hands the ball to the Bills for a TD on the first drive, then fumbles for them in the 4th quarter when we had the lead.
2) Our o-line lets more guys in than a cheap hooker. Yesterday's "improved" o-line performance (measuring sacks) was a mask. Tannehill was able to buy more time by rolling out and we ran better, but they did not play better.

It's really easy to call out coaches as the problem, but you don't know what play was called, when Tannehill audibled out, how they prepared...do you expect Sherman to suit up and play tackle? Or run on the field and stop Tannehill's occasional bad decision? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi reddit.

I want to paint a wall in my new place and there are large screw holes (where material is actually protruding out) and a few holes that look like their were filled with some cement like material -- where the cement is not flush but again protruding out.

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/kl8Iz

What's the best way to fix these? Probably a noob question, but I'm a noob to this kind of stuff.

Thanks for any help!

Play on evilmania's servers and you'll see what I mean. Infected teams can select the special infected they want to be (can't duplicate an infected without spending points that are collected by playing) and Survivors can purchase weapons or health. It's not for everyone, but if you've been playing for a while and are fairly skilled it adds another level of strategy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Where to sell domain names </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-07 23:56:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's get a list going of the places to sell domain names.

**sedo.com and afternic.com** are both marketplaces where you can sell domain names at retail. Escrow is available through these.

**namepros.com** is a domain name forum that has a section for sales; however, generally these are not end users purchasing, but other domainers, and so the price you'll get will be at a step discount. Note that the buy/sell process is outside of the forum so use escrow to protect yourself during the transaction.

**tobyclements.com** is a broker who deals with premium domains. He handles the transaction and takes 20%. You send him names that you are interested in selling along with your asking price (he'll reject if you don't include a price) and he uses his network to help sell. Often these are not end users, so you may not get top-dollar, but he does work with companies or individuals who will be end-users who are looking for the right domain.

**ebay.com** is really hit-or-miss for domains. Your listing would have to be viewed by someone interested in that industry/niche specifically. It is possible to sell on ebay, and many domainers have, but there seems to be quite a bit of luck involved. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-08-07 22:58:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi redditors!

I have taken over r/domainnames and would like to know what you would like to see from this subreddit.

I'm open to ideas, but a few of mine are below:
* Industry news.
* Premium names for sale (keyword-rich .com, .net, .org). I don't want this to get spammy, so possibly these go to a moderation queue if that's possible (I'll look into).
* Questions on domaining as a hobby or business.
* Success stories, case studies.
* Domain names   SEO

I've been dabbling in domain name buying/selling for many years and so can help others, though I'd like to see more users here to assist each other. I also have a lot of experience in SEO, and so can answer questions that pertain to domains in relation to that discipline.

Domaining can be really fun. Finding that diamond either not registered or about to be released and flipping is a lot like real estate with many of the same principles applying.

<TEXT> Hi again,

Well now that I take a closer look I don't think it's an issue of space between the copper place and that copper tubing, but here are photos of the unit assembled, the GPU uncovered, and a side shot so you can see the space (or lackthereof) between that plate and tube.

<TEXT> I'll take a photo tomorrow, I really appreciate the help. 

When I had it on earlier and the case open, the metal plate on the GPU was hot (as in cook flesh in 1 second) and the heat sink by the fan was relatively cool. So possibly heat isn't transferring to that copper tube thingy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Positive I did the GPU and not the CPU. 

The thermal paste was placed between the GPU and a copper plate. There is a plastic piece that surrounds the GPU on all sides that I wasn't expecting (note that it was not on top of the GPU though). 

I'm a little hesitant to get a picture because it means taking it apart again. How helpful would it be?

It seems very strange to me that it would even get that hot when not running something demanding. I even started windows in safe mode and ended up turning it off it got so hot.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Nvidia GeForce 460m Overheating at Idle </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-21 01:09:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit techsupport,

I have a 2 year old Sager laptop with a GeForce 460m graphics card. About 2 weeks ago it started acting strange and automatically shutting off. This started when I was playing L4D2 - when there was a big horde and lots of action it would start to stutter and then just shut off. At first I thought it was due to the similarly timed Steam update, that maybe it was more RAM demanding. 

Then I noticed how hot the machine was getting and downloaded speedfan to monitor temps while playing. The GPU would get to about 110c and then the stuttering starts and the laptop would shut down. 

Now I turn on my laptop and turn on speedfan and nothing else. In well under a minute (30 seconds maybe) the temp of the GPU gets to 117c and shuts down - and that's with having the laptop on its side with the bottom casing off for better ventilation. 

Obviously I don't have enough time to even download new drivers. 

Is this a thing with this GPU? What should I do? Given my recent divorce (not looking for sympathy) I can't afford to swap the chip. 

Typing on my phone so sorry for any typos. 

Any help is appreciated.

<TEXT> I'm thinking about signing up for MoviePass (like $30/month and you get to go to unlimited number of movies, a few caveats of course) but I'm wondering if anyone has tried this in VT theaters, and if so how it went.

Theoretically it should work since it's just a Discover credit card, but you never know.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pretty easy for people to say "resign", but difficult to do.

It sounds like your boss is aware of your position on this, make sure that others are as well. Leaders in the organization need to understand the impact (potential consequences) of the strategy, and ideally know that you are not a proponent of it, though still see you as a team player since you are moving forward with it per instructions.

You may have to work around your boss to achieve the above, but the greater good is the organization and not your boss' ego. Help your boss understand that your concern is the success of the business, and it isn't anything personal. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Buying statues for decor. Where? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'd love a statue (specifically looking for one of Thoth) for my home, but what I've been able to find online are generally very small (a few inches) or just outrageously priced (IMHO).

Do you know of any places online where you can buy ~4' (feet) statues? Wood is fine with me, not looking for marble or anything like that.

Thanks.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've searched around but not finding much that really helps explain what someone who contacted me is trying to do, at least in a way that I understand. 

I am selling my condo and I got a call from an investment company (supposedly at least) saying they were interested in my property. She asked if we were to come to an agreed upon selling price if I would be willing to have them take on the mortgage payments. 

I told them I didn't understand what they were trying to do and would need more information, and she said she would arrange for the investor to contact me (I got the investor's name and she works at a local university, so I'm not sure how legit this is if she still holds a "regular" job). 

Any idea what this is? Sounds like bad news to me, but I'm not a mortgage expert.  </TEXT>

On one occasion someone said that it's due to equipment on the street and that it would be upgraded, but that was 3 years ago...

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

I own a condo and am going through a divorce. I have an ok amount of equity in the condo, so what I'd like to do is sell it in order to pay my ex a lump sum which would reduce the amount of alimony I pay per month.

My understanding is if I sell the condo I'll take a big tax hit unless I put that money back into a place to live. Is there some work-around where if you sell property but the money goes to alimony you don't take that hit?

I appreciate any help.

I need help from an accountant ASAP. I am now going through a divorce and need to know the best way to go with finances/alimony. I need info asap as my soon-to-be-ex wants to move quickly. I'm not asking for a hand-out, I'll pay the person, but really need 30-60 minutes of a professionals time as early as possible. Monday or Tuesday afternoon would be ideal.

<TITLE> Just berated by Ebay customer support </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-07 18:41:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wish I recorded the conversation as it was hilariously bad. I purchased a cell phone and 5 days later still no communication from the seller (I've been emailing through ebay asking for updates), so I opened a case and called their "support" department to attempt to move the escalation date up -- since the seller hasn't communicated in 5 days I don't see the point in giving him 7 more days, which the case provides.

Anyway, the conversation with the "Manager" quickly escalated to him telling me "you're new to ebay, you don't know how it works" when I've been a member since 2001. He then berated me for not having much feedback "you only have 6 feedback, you don't know how this works". His tone was very much like bad parenting.

I have to admit I was laughing on the inside, but certainly not going to be using ebay again when you call for help from a non-responsive seller (I used paypal) and they literally make fun of you on the phone.

At the end I recommended customer service training for him, he didn't seem to like that. </TEXT>

First, why converting?

Second, the transfer should not take hours.

I'm looking for a tablet with a great display for primarily watching movies, and I want access to the Play store (hence not the Kindle), though I will likely only install a few apps. Is there something I'm missing with this one? Seems super cheap.

Stats from Amazon and link for reference:
- Super HD definition with up to 2048 x 1536 pixels resolution
- 9.7" capacitive 10x multitouch capacitive IPS display
- Google certified with full access to the Google Play Store and its 700.000 apps to download
- Aluminium back casing
    Front and back cameras with autofocus mode (2   5 MP)

<TEXT> I've been reading comments, and it's interesting to read other perspectives. 

I admit I could be wrong (time will tell) but I don't see the pistol as a fad. I never thought the wildcat would last, and it hasn't, but the pistol is a much different threat and harder to defend. With the pistol you actually have someone who can throw the ball involved, rather than a Ronnie Brown who didn't offer much threat there. 

If I were to select an offense, I wouldn't utilize the pistol much for the same reason others said, injuries. RG3 is amazing, but I think his career will be limited by injuries. Wilson and Kaper might hold up better though. 

We'll see! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want to be an Ireland defender, but let me give it a shot.

McCown was 2008, which Parcells was in charge of. Feel free to disagree, but if we are going to evaluate Ireland I feel like the last 2 years are the ones to look at.

When I look at last year's draft, I think it may end up being one of the best that any team had in 2012, especially considering rookie free agents.

Here's why. Our picks:
1st Round  Ryan Tannehill (QB, Texas A M)
2nd Round  Jonathan Martin (OT, Stanford)
3rd Round  Olivier Vernon (DE, Miami)
3rd Round  Michael Egnew (TE, Missouri)
4th Round  Lamar Miller (RB, Miami)
5th Round  Josh Kaddu (OLB, Oregon)
6th Round  B.J. Cunningham (WR, Michigan State)
7th Round  Kheeston Randall (DL, Texas)
7th Round  Rishard Matthews (WR, Nevada)

So we had 4 draft picks as solid contributors this year (Tannehill, Martin, Vernon, Miller). That looks pretty good!

Add Lane and Thigpen and that's 6 solid rookie players in one off-season.

I think you will be hard pressed to find many teams that got 6 starters from the draft. If I compare this draft to an Ozzie Newsome one, who I think is great, the Ravens best draft may have been 2008 where they got Joe Flacco, Ray Rice, and Tom Zbikowski (now with the Colts). That's 3 players out of 10 picks. I don't know who their rookie free agents were, but we know those are rare anyway. The rest of the Ravens picks aren't even on their team anymore, just Flacco and Rice. Two important pieces and that's a successful draft.

I guess what I'm saying is that I think Ireland has become the fall guy, and people have really high expectations in a draft (most guys don't work out, just a fact). I wanted Ireland fired after 2011, but the more I thought about it, the more I feel he really does deserve to continue. Parcells is the guy we should be mad at, he didn't pick a good coach or QB, so we were doomed. Now Ireland is in charge, and so far so good. Let's just hope it continues.

Anyway, agree to disagree I guess.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol, decaf!

You just said he sucked the whole time, so what do you expect in return? A second rounder for a guy you readily admit sucked (your word) sounds like we got the better end of the deal.  I'll take that deal every day. 

And I haven't down voted any of your posts or comments (that i am aware of) and am willing to make that public to prove it. 

Deep breath now!

Here's the challenge I've got. I occasionally connect to my home laptop from my iphone using VNC when I'm at work, so obviously I need to know my home laptop's IP address. 

Unfortunately, my crappy backwoods DSL connection occasionally restarts, and then I get a new IP.

Is there any way to set something up so I always know my home laptop's IP, even when not there?

Appreciate any assistance.

As someone with a lot of hours, it's a very strategic game that can be ruined by inexperienced players. I'm not a fan of kicking, however, if you don't communicate and try to follow instructions you probably will be kicked. But it does depend on who you are playing with. Tell people you are new and listening, they should give you a chance.  </TEXT>
