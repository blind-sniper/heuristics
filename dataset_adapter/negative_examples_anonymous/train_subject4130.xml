<TEXT> You can't read, and comprehend a bill in half an hour. This still means that the senator received the bill around 3:10, how the fuck can you comprehend and read a bill in that amount of time? A 1000 page highway bill. Oh wait, you can't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He certainly doesn't pretend he's a libertarian, he's came out and said he's not. Nor is he a social conservative, I pay very close attention to Dr. Paul's campaign and he is far from a social conservative. And believing that the government shouldn't be involved in marriage at all doesn't make one a social conservative.

Cutting government waste is different then "cutting social programs on the backs of the poor" We don't need to be paying social security benefits to millions of people over the age of 112, simply because there aren't many people above that age; we don't need to be paying dead people. That being said, we shouldn't be eager to just waste money on programs that fail or are ineffective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have to realize these senators have NO time to read these bills. 1000 pages long and in the case of one senator, it wasn't done printing 500 pages at 3:30 when voting was at 4. If I were in office, I'd immediately vote no on anything I don't have enough time to read and comprehend. Bad and destructive bills get passed by glossing over important facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's stated this multiple times even before the supreme Court decision. He needs to appeal to a conservative base while maintaining (relatively) libertarian principles. Which this is a belief libertarians have held for a long time.

When asked he could have said "I support marriage equality, but not in the way liberals support it or conservatives denounce it. I'd get the government out of marriage all together." But he needs to appeal to conservatives if he wants to have a chance, unlike his father. So he said "I want to get government out of marriage all together" 

It's politics. If he said it like that, some news pundit would sensationalize the title to opposite side, losing him vital votes. That article was deliberately worded to make him look bad, just as his answer was deliberately worded to appeal to conservatives.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  FRANK:This series is artistically going to share a lot with Sequences previous style, so youll see some continuity for sure, but the scale and fidelity of the animation for this is more ambitious than Sequences already gorgeous, dreamlike tradition  and this is fully animated and mostly 3D. Its just a lot more work, and not just in animating, but in shading and texturing the painterly style. Its hard work.

<TEXT> Why not? I literally said basically the exact same thing and you think I'm wrong. Maybe you should re-read. I never said "it's totally ok to burn innocent people's shit". I said I know why it happens, and it serves the societal purpose of bringing attention to the unheard, as it has always done. People getting mad and starting shit brings change. 

Then why would you quote him? You quoted him to disprove my point about riots not being a good thing from his perspective and it didn't work. And you didn't say what I said, all you said was " interesting"

Rephrasing what I said doesn't change it: People getting mad and flipping tables changed shit for the better.

Protesting changes things for the better. Rioting does not, it causes more problems than it solves. Like millions in damage and people's lives.

One of the above is either not true or you contradict yourself.

You cherry picked what I said, I was referring to rioting. Obviously destruction of property is justified when protecting ones self, other lives, or more valuable property.  I don't get where you thought I value property over lives, like I said before, this is about senseless riot destruction not using a precious vase to disable an attacker.

At any rate, you're already deep into illogical land anyway, as you've decided no amount of damage to people is an acceptable reason to damage *property*. So hopefully you'll be letting all your loved one's know you'd never shoot an intruder who only wanted to rape and kill them, because shooting him would damage your property with blood spatter, and you've established "stuff" is worth more than "people".

Again, that wasn't ever my point. People have a right to protect themselves and their property, rioting doesn't count as such. That intruder I'm shooting could very well be a rioter taking advantage of the lawlessness so rioting and destruction is even further unjustified. 

My point was and has always been, that it is unjustified to destroy someone else's property to further an agenda to bring "change" because in reality you end up hurting your case and innocent lives in the long run. How would you feel if rioters destroyed all of your shit? "Oh no it's okay, it'll bring change and a national discussion on the issue" even though most rioters couldn't give a fuck and just want to steal your things. Either way, it's my property and my decision whether to get blood spatter on it and I'm not intentionally looting and destroying someone else's things, I'm defending my life or someone else's. 

I don't get where you thought I valued stuff over people? I can be against senseless destruction of property that actually hurts people's lives while valuing life itself. You grossly misunderstand and exaggerate the point I'm trying to make. Furthermore, I don't quite get how justifying the destruction of property in riots is valuing people, it's just selfish because it's an idea that your cause is worth more than someones property and in some cases livelihood. Someone being shot by the police doesn't justify a *person's* small business being smashed to shit and the destruction of a community.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you like MLK? He knew better than you too: 
"It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.

Yeah. That *is* interesting coming from someone that advocated no violence whatsoever during his **entire movement**. Don't mistake his understanding of why people do what they do, for acceptance of it. Because that's not what he's doing. Do you even understand what he's saying? He says that it's bad and he feels empathy for those that riot, but he clearly didn't approve of rioting. I mean c'mon, he's legitimately known for nonviolent protesting. 

And exactly what it has taken to enact change, over and over again. Boston Tea Party, Kent State, Stonewall Riots. 

The Boston tea party didn't put forward much change directly if you didn't know. It just pissed off the Brits, and they enacted the Coersion Acts that was meant to punish the colonists. THAT is what pushed real change; reactionary government legislation that led to the creation of the Continental Congress. Like I said, Ben Franklin directly disapproved of the BTP. 

Once again, rioting at Kent State didn't cause any change. The government *shooting* brought national outrage. There was no private property involved unless you count that statue. 

The civil war is the immediate example that springs to mind. According to your quote above, abolishing slavery was to the detriment of life and freedom. Most of my black neighbors would disagree.

What? They weren't a car or a piece of land, it was a controversy since it started because they are sentient people, and slavery wasn't abolished by uncoordinated rioting and property destruction (it was a side affect, but done by the Union Army). It was abolished through a movement, military war, then a proclamation in that order. Are you trying to advocate that it would be okay to kill and maim slaves (if this were 1850) in a riot to try and affect change for the "greater good"? Because what I'm trying to say is that it isn't okay. And the points you make are contradictory.

You can't use the slave - property argument to justify the destruction of property in a riot. But I digress, private property is essential to freedom for obvious reasons. Slavery wasn't right and they were ALWAYS an issue in regard to being property. Semantics. The destruction of private property is never justified.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. You misunderstand the point. It doesn't make logical sense to go destroy someones property to further a pumped up political agenda that can be solved, debated, or protested peacefully. Often times it ruins lives, makes the agenda look bad, and costs millions of dollars for *rarely* any change, but rather increased force and backlash. What does destroying that family bakery down the street solve? What about that old man's Buick? You think he can afford a new one on SS checks? Or the SUV that the young couple with a kid just took out a loan for and gave a down payment; hmmm now their new 2015 Honda is burnt to shit because some dick was "protesting" the system. 

The mentality you put forward is selfish at best, delusional at worst. If you need force to push your political ideology, you have a shit ideology. Personal freedom and life relies on the idea of private property and respect for others, something MLK and Ghandi recognized when they protested. If anything, it's a detriment to life and freedom when some self righteous asshole thinks he helping the greater good by destroying someones livelyhood, investment, or property. 

So no. Salon isn't right, and they're full of fucking shit. Of course I get downvoted for presenting ideas opposite of the /r/politics hivemind. </TEXT>

We need to do the same, and coordinate. 3k dedicated people is enough to get the same support for Rand. Only Rand has a legitimate chance at getting the nomination AND the presidency. We just need to gain the rabid internet support and the Facebook Republicans. We have a serious shot.

Coordinating officially with his campaign wouldn't hurt either. People just need a a little Rand spark. I'm willing to help coordinate and come up with a legit game plan, we can dominate social media for Republicans/libertarians similar to what Sanders is doing for liberals.

<TEXT> In the first pic you look depressed, annoyed, and negative. No one wants to be around someone who won't give them good emotions, at the end of the day that's what interactions are about; making people feel good emotions and "vibes" about you. That pic screams "I'm a drag and no fun to be around" and has a salty vibe. It simply doesn't put good emotions into those who see it. Plus it's just a horrible selfie with bad lighting. T

he next one is generic with no personality whatsoever, and the other one makes you look feminine and desperate for attention. 

My advice: 

- smile or add personality without it. 

- get a buddy to take your pic in better lighting. Preferably when doing something fun that demonstrates high value where you can get a good face shot

- have a pic of you and your buds at the club, with some personality.

- spice up your bio with something a little less generic. Like it was said before, everyone is on Tinder to have fun. So put some legitimate things about yourself and a witty remark that will make you stand out from the thousands of other guys these girls see. They have more options than you do and are more selective. 

- maybe another more masculine pic with your pet. 

- just stand out, be fun and exciting. </TEXT>

If so, and your goal of to get big and cut, yes, it's bad progress. Really bad. You may have defined out a bit, but you need to get significantly bigger so bulking is a must. It seems you don't have the diet in order at all. You need to eat at a large caloric surplus to gain weight and it doesn't look like you have been doing that. Simply just working out doesn't cut it, diet is just as vital as training. So I think you just need to her serious about your diet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lee wasn't even a slave owner. He didn't agree with slavery either, the only reason he fought for the CSA was because his loyalties were to his state and way of life over his nation. This was the case with the overwhelming majority of CSA soldiers who were only in the war to fight for their home and from foreign aggressors. My biggest fear with all of this is that we will begin to condemn the soldiers and their memorials along with the flag.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He is a conservative but he isn't for unequal rights for people. But the institution of marriage has been around since before our government and has been a religious thing. It's *semantics*, marriage has been between a man and a woman and first defined that way by religion, the government just gave them benefits and prevented gays from having the same ones (bad). Paul just says gays should have the same rights, but it shouldn't be called marriage because that word implies sanction by god. Which gays *may* not have.

All in all, he wants the government totally out of it unless enforcement of the contracts so this issue wouldn't even be relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because they are equal rights. Marriage isn't a right defined in the constitution. It isn't a right to be regulated, registered, and defined by the government. It *was* a religious institution before it was a government one, and it was around before our government decided to regulate it. This is his point, he doesn't want to spite anybody. Paul has held you'd position for awhile now, you honestly think a libertarianesq like him wants to have his life regulated and registered by the government? Fuck no

Like I said before, he wanted to be married. The only way to do that was to actually get married. He's advocating for most of the benefits instead of taxes to be covered in a legal contract between two people without state intervention unless it's time for it to be enforced or annulled.

What you're essentially saying is equivalent to saying people can't support civil rights because they're white, or more accurately, proper immigration reform because they live comfortably in the US.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because people that had ran our country were deeply religious. I'm not trying to justify those laws, rather argue for them to be removed entirely and replaced with legal contacts. 

Religious people want the right to the word *marriage* and LGBT want equal benefit from the government in regard to the act of marriage. There's no reason one can't be called marriage and the other a civil union. You could argue that it's "separate but equal" but it's really not, it's legal semantics and that's it. And like it or not, marriage is a religious institution that's been around for millennia and has been defined as between a man and a woman.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not true at all. One can get married and enjoy the benefits and advocate for change. Why? Because the change he advocates for affects his marriage and would make the institution itself far better off. You can't blame him for taking advantage of the only way to get married, like literally everyone else. The  government doesn't need to be involved in everything. 

Your logic relies on the idea that he would want these benefits from the government at the time he got married even though he received them. He wanted to be married and committed to someone he loves, not the benefits that entails. We know this is true because his position has been constant and he's willing to make a change that affects his marriage here and now. He still says this at risk of losing christian GOP votes that he will need for the primary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that his economic stance is just horrendous - but I really don't think Paul has a good chance at winning, and my ONLY reason for thinking that is because he'll be running under the republican ticket. The republican party has done a well and thorough job of making themselves look even worse than the democrats, which is his downfall. 

They control congress so it's not out of question. However the dems seem to be the sexier party nowadays. It's unfortunate honestly, because Rand, Justin Amash, and Thomas Massie are very good Republicans. Bernie is the only Dem I see that is making waves with integrity. Hillary will win the primary, she'll go against bush and a battle of legacy will ensue, Hillary will win. Or against Walker and Hillary will still win because he is just a run of the mill republican and the country won't vote for that.

Well, a candidate needs funds to get the message out there. Many times have otherwise good candidates been outspent by horrible candidates that take tons of money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from, as I've considered it myself. But I absolutely can't support his ridiculous stance on the economy that will do more damage to our country than his integrity will do good. We've had good people that were bad presidents, ex Jimmy Carter, and it won't set any gears in motion that will create good presidents in the future. Plus, he won't get along with congress either because of how belligerent he is. 

Rand Paul is the best bet at the moment. A candidate must take contributions from corporations in order to even compete and Rand Paul is on par with Sanders in terms of integrity, but with better views. I pay very close attention to Paul and his campaign, he is the best for the job. Either way, his tax plan isn't very friendly to large subsidized corporations and neither is his foreign policy plan for military contracting companies.  </TEXT>

I straight up told them I wasn't sure about religion or god, they told me that's fine you're young. 9 times out of 10 they will find an excuse to pass you as long as you aren't callus about it. They know it's kind of a stupid rule, but religion is integral to scouting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been apart of it for the better part of my life. I can say with absolute certainty that scouting is one of the last true bastions of youth development and citizenship in America. IMO it undoubtedly trains and equips better and more honorable citizens and well rounded men. 

It's a shame all of that crap the organization has been put through in regards to sex abuse and gaining a bad rep. They are caught between a rock and a hard place with funding from both human rights organizations and churches, both threatening to withdraw funding if they don't get their way, and right at a time in history when young men need scouting the most.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of the weight on society, comes from corporations using government regulations to their advantage, and lobbying government for one way or the other. Ultimately they're making an environment where they aren't subject to proper market competition, thus you get a shittier cheaper product/service because you can't go anywhere else, and corporations that don't have to worry about things smaller businesses would. 

A businesses purpose in society is to make a profit. If profit is made, the consumer has benefited and they are giving society something they want. Supply and demand. Unless of course this business buys policy and saturates it's industry with regulations, and corporate welfare. Which creates something that is absolute shit for people while enriching the corporation (Comcast). By the time those profit decisions actually harm society is when they use the government to make more money. If you subject the "evil" corporations to proper market competition, they'd be forced to compete to provide a good product or service. The best ones would get big.

However, the case for environmental protection is pretty compelling.  </TEXT>

You're whole argument is a subjective reasoning that it's "silly" to call yourself a particular name identifying yourself with a certain group.

<TEXT> I just started bodybuilding and was confused when I went to /r/gainit. It seemed like all these skinny guys like me that were lifting for months haven't made much progress except putting on some fat. Then I observe some of my IRL friends go from skinny to decently muscular in a matter of months, and continue to pack on the muscle. My fear is ending up skinny fat or simply not making the progress I want in terms of muscle gains after a long period of time.

I'm not sure if you'd be able to shed some light on this with any advice but I'm counting calories and macros with a reputable program on bodybuilding.com. I just want to pack on lean pounds (not afraid of a little fat)

<TEXT> I've been talking with my friends about this for a year. Imagine it:

Players can choose between three armies, then choose Spartan or Elite, both with a plethora of customization options. You get an entire halo ring in all of its glory to explore and fight for control over. Three armies fight for control of many large bases, strategic positions, containment facilities, even the most prized possession of them all; the control room, all the way down to small skirmishes over small areas.. 

You can start squads and clans, get a large number of many different types of missions from command. Or go freemode with your squad and explore the vast expanses and caverns of the ring, hunting the various terminals, datapads, and audiopads that explain exactly what is happening and why it's happening. The enemy that lies within the labyrinth of the installation may be enough to unite the bitter enemies of the surface...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm really new to all of this and I do plan to travel. It won't happen for years to come, however, I will do it. 

I hear from my Aunt and family about horrible hitchhiking experiences, people getting raped and murdered left and right. My dad used to hitchhike short distances locally until some guy fake threatened him, and then told him how unsafe it was. This was the 70's. So due to this, I've always had that stigma and fear about it.

Then I watched that *Thumbs up, America* where they show positive experiences. But even that guy said he was almost raped twice. It also seemed like some of it wasn't legit. And you fine folks seem to do it no problem. I'm wondering if some of you could share your perspectives and experiences. Thank you in advance. </TEXT>

But what are they doing now that they haven't been doing before? Generally, for what they believe, is the greater good. Now we have something intentionally stirring up chaos and the biggest scandal in human history. 

It seems that someone or something may be trying to weaken humanity as a whole by causing dissent within the ranks of the UNSC, and stirring more people towards the innie cause then ever before. All while the Covenant is reforming under Jul for the sole purpose of destroying humanity. Now we have a flood return? So then the question remains, who is behind all of this?

Or that he went off the chain and derailed legitimate peace talks? Is chief a hero or a legitimate traitor? Even as listeners now, we have no idea. Before, we were sure chief had his reasons. 

It looks at the spartan program and ONI from a different light. We see how people view the chief and the political climate of humanity. Locke finally has justification for his mission. Humanity will be thrust into chaos, and will be pushed to the brink of destruction once more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You didn't cite Financial Times. You can't cite something that you casually mention. You need a link. At the moment, it's anecdotal.

Labor doesn't need to up for capital to be gained. The whole point of capitalism is to make money, and with the internet, its easier to make money with LESS input (labor required to produce) and MORE output. So that whole point about financial times fails, it just means the free market found more effective ways to produce something. If anything, the internet is the greatest true capitalistic tool of our age. 

- It allows for equal opportunity to earn money. 
- people can freely get their ideas out there.
- people aren't suppressed. Even though the government is trying. 
- There are no or limited regulations holding businesses and enterprise on the internet. 
- anyone can learn if they have the drive to do so.

These are capitalist properties, not socialist. Reddit is a capitalist product, Facebook is a capitalist product, and so is almost everything else on the internet. If you think the internet is "socialist" you're blind and need to understand economics. 

I suggest reading *Economics in one lesson* by Harry Hazlett, *the law* by Fredric Bastiat, *Economic Facts and Fallacies* by Thomas Sowell, and *Capitalism and freedom* by Milton Freedman. These are written by legitimate and reputable economists. Make an effort to understand all economic systems and how ours is *supposed* to work. www.FEE.com is a great site for learning economics </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is irrelevant. They are different games with maps designed to suit the game. Lockout wouldn't play well with H5 for a variety of reasons. However, Truth plays well and integrates skill jumping techniques that are arguably more challenging than traditional crouch jumping. Just because something changes, doesn't mean it's worse or bad. 

Crouch jumping still plays an integral part in the meta. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've suggested this before, but in my opinion Spartan Ops were an amazing innovation yet poorly implemented. So as a result, I would like to see Spartan Ops return with seasonal storylines from around the universe. For example, a storyline from Johnson's time as an S1, playing as an ancient human during the war period, Kurt during his time with Green, headhunter missions, or even Noble Six's survival and redeployment (he's alive *fuckers*). 

There is SO much they could do with SO many stories to tell from this rich universe. As for gameplay, they should play more like a campaign rather than firefight with more interesting levels. They could do it and it player retention would go through the roof. But they would need a dedicated team similar to the way they do campaigns. Just release the missions weekly like a TV show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Much has, but much hasn't. I guarantee that unless it's involved in banking or drugs, the money has been earned legitimately. By nature, a business's duty to society is to make a profit. It's the tell tale sign as to whether it's needed and contributing. When profit is made, money has exchanged hands and a mutual exchange of goods or service for money has occurred. That business owner is being rewarded for his contribution. This happens even with the "evil corporations" Sanders wants to stop. So the more competitive the market, the harder it is to game the system. 

The issue happens when there is no competition and then prices can gauge. Example, cable and internet companies. In this case, government regulations strangled it. Which Sanders supports. So for a variety of reasons. Capitalism  socialism in pretty much every way.

It's hard to define free flowing economy because technically it already is if it's not government. Then it would only be in other people's accounts but spread out, so it wouldn't be nearly as effective. Bill Gates can invest that money, help his own enterprise, or donate it. Which applies for most rich people and benefits the economy more then redistributing it would.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I said, neither of them are war mongers. But the economic situation is a lot more complicated then that. Like... *a lot*. Chances are, if that money ended up in someone's bank account, they either: 

1.) Had illustrious government help. Bailouts, banking cabals, cable and internet companies, funding etc etc. Basically **crony** capitalism and exempt from market competition. 

2.) Benefited society in some way to generate that capital. Take Bill Gates for example, he made his money in a way that helped society advance. He did so with no government help. Look at Elon Musk. Same example, whom without his billions in the bank account, wouldn't have been able to start SpaceX or Tesla. BOTH benefiting society in a way the government never could. 

Redistribution of wealth (if that's what you're arguing for) are basically universally bad and have the opposite of the desired effect. 

What should be done is ending corporate welfare and creating a competitive field in the market. Which mah boi Rand wants to do. And this nearly universally improves the economy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's in a difficult position, but he's more of a libertarian. He has many socially liberal views but has to appeal to a socially conservative base. So his official position on certain issues are to leave it up to the states. Even though he's introduced a bill to legalize marijuana on a federal level, and has been open in his position on ending the drug war. 

When the debate happens, Rand v Sanders. It's going to be almost completely economic. In recent years we've had candidates that were extremely similar to each other and only differed when it came to smaller issues.

Now we have candidates that *generally* share the classic American view pertaining to foreign policy and social issues, but couldn't be further apart in regard to the economy.  </TEXT>

He also writes some amazing and detailed updates letting us know what is happening along with the thought process that goes into it. I also hear he lurks here and posts occasionally. 

Then goes and casts the HCS like a boss. 

So bravo, Bravo.

<TEXT> Yup. Honestly, that game is the shit. It's current competitive settings (MLG V7) are probably the best iteration out of any halo. The custom games community is flourishing because of how customizable forge and games are, the campaign and customization options are great.

<TEXT> Many didn't like it because launch settings were trash. But within the game itself, there were custom tools, forge world and the best forge system yet, plus the title update. It made that game arguably the best playing halo.

Seriously, go back on your 360 and launch Reach. Then head into the MLG playlist. It's easily the best variant of halo gameplay to date. Smooth and full of skill. The game also had some of the best custom games and forge world allowed for players creativity and content to flow. If it had better launch settings, it would have been almost as popular as halo 3.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was absolutely incredible. After reading the lines from H3 terminals, it just screams the old plan of "humans were forerunners".

So to sum this up a bit more. Humanity is facing: 

- Rebellion and dissent within its military and outer colonies

- Flood's possible return. And in heavy numbers

- Jul and Halsey (whom are both hellbent on revenge) have the Janus key and every piece of forerunner tech. 

- plus, a fuckton of Promethean knights at their disposal and the manipulative covie religion is on the rise. 

- John is AWOL at a time that is arguably **more threatening then the human covie war**. Humanities greatest hero abandoned them when they needed him most. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You just disqualified every candidate running if you think those politifact statements, an opinion on vaccines, and a false statement about a legitimately half right figure on tax fraud to make a point that was still properly made regardless of the money figure (was still around 25%) make him unfit for any office. Then this means nearly every single person holding public office isn't fit for office, or the majority of our past presidents. That simply isn't a realistic and logical dismissal of his ability for office

You could do a quick google search on any public figure and get shit. You could even go in the opposite direction and google good things about him. The fact that you can Google has no bearing on this argument. As a result, none of what you linked can hardly qualify as being disconnected from reality; if that's the case, then most of Washington needs to be thrown in a mental hospital. Nor can you just dismiss his supporters as being simply "enamored" 

I don't support some of what he says and I don't think he's the savior of murica (so I'm clearly not enamored) but he's a foot in the door toward the direction we need to go. Change won't happen over night. 

Edit: Did you even read that full article you linked me on him? It praises some of his policy decisions and stand points. Specifically on states rights, marijuana, gay marriage, spying and more.  </TEXT>

But these people are more deadly, much more heavily funded, armed to the teeth with top grade military weapons, and smarter then ISIS terrorists, they are the government in many places. The militias are just starting to fight back.

They won't be afraid to behead you for 5 dollars and especially if you look foreign. It gets better the more south you go, but I think traveling through north will prove to be an issue. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pertaining to MCC. They do deserve the criticism. But at this point its beating a dead horse. Going on about it at this point does nothing. They put their name on games like spartan assault, MCC, and others because they are the franchise. This doesn't mean they focused on it while taking away from the main project.

I wouldn't say their priorities are broken. They had a very specific timeframe to release things with two completely separate teams. Plus, they needed to have enough time to implement beta feedback. Why delay the beta and put that project at risk because of MCC. To many chefs in the kitchen isn't a good thing. And the overwhelming majority at 343 are on h5.

343 aren't the ones working on ODST and relic. Saber and certain affinity are the ones on that. They didn't even start ODST until after release.

They released Forge Island based on feedback, changed in game H4 settings for feedback, H5 is being changed based on feedback. They are listening to the general consensus on things

343 is a competent company. Only real fuck up this gen was MCCs release. Everything else has been fine. It's just that Dobbins is beating a dead horse. 343 knows that MCC had a shitty release and they know people disliked h4; they've heard it a million times. At this point it adds nothing to discussion and Dobbins perpetuates this attitude toward halo that doesn't help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, his anger and frustration are what is needed for 343 to get their head out of their wallets and realize what people want. It's the ignorance of so many people like yourself that just assume 343 is going to pull through when their record shows they have failed at everything they have done before. 

Halo 4, fail. Did they alter anything quickly to fix the problems, hell no, they were focused on MCC. MCC, fail. Have they altered and patched the problems accordingly, no. They have taken their time because the majority of their team is on Halo 5.

You assume that they fully developed MCC. It makes no sense to take people off halo 5 to work on MCC. None at all. Plus you assume they could have just altered some shit and and it would have been all hunky dory.

Now with that track record, the only record 343 has with games, what makes you think H5 is going to be any different? Dobbins and others who criticize them, like myself, don't wish for Halo to fail, but want people to stop accepting and promoting 343 to just keep doing what they are doing. All he is saying is don't listen to this bullshit 'Locke vs. Chief' hype and pre-order or buy this game before you know what you're getting. 

You assume people dont know what they're getting, even though they've played a beta that they enjoyed. One that ran more smooth than MCC. Criticism is fine. Making click bait circle jerk titles like "you hate halo if you pre-order halo 5" is not.

Look at it this way, Bungie took 3 years to produce each of their 4 games from Halo CE to Reach, 343 will have produced 3 games in 3 years with DLC already in the works prior to H5 release. Priorities have been set for 343 and it's worth betting that they have not learned from their mistakes with the way things have been going

You straight up assume 343 has hands on developed every halo title. They had other studios do them while they focused on the main title at hand (H5) You also assume they have DLC in development. The MCC dlc is being done by separate companies while 343 is focused on H5. They still stick to the 3 year dev cycle.

You also assume 343 hasn't done anything right. Even though we have HCS, good lore, and had a well received beta. 

You also seem to assume they aren't listening to any feedback, even though they have the feedback program and made a halo 5 update post where they flat out implemented community feedback. Just because they aren't listening to *your* feedback, and dobbins. Doesn't mean they aren't listening. 

Dobbins really is leading an overreacted crusade against nothing. And hurting halo in the process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> - HCS is rising and the competitive scene is beginning to rise again
- Lore has been handled wonderfully with books, comics, and merch.
- Halo is gaining more content creators, YouTubers, and fan sites. Compared to the dying of Reach and 4
- Halo 5 is looking extremely promising so far. From a story perspective and MP
- MCC is functional, 343 is working around the clock to bring the next TU.
- no longer is this sub and every halo forum filled with anti 343 circle jerk. We are seeing discussion, awesome clips and more. 

Halo isn't dad. We just have to accept that halo isn't the top dog mainstream game anymore. And work to be a friendly community newcomers want to be apart of.  </TEXT>

His intentions may be good, but perpetuating halo hate is undeniably bad for the franchise. The comments on that video were just a huge circlejerk that said fuck 343.  </TEXT>

I agree we haven't seen enough of Locke to judge, but he will obey orders without question. But we see him with a strong sense of duty, morals, and honor. Most ONI don't have that. So it's hard to say and he could go either way at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/ratidiot. There are many differences between Locke and Chief. Locke had no part in any of that ONI bullshit. Literally, he is a hunter and a hit man for ONI. I'll copy and paste from waypoint:

 Locke, however, still blamed the government for failing to defend his homeworld. Arriving at the conclusion that the UNSC was incapable of protecting anyone else, he struck out on his own and became a freelancer, selecting and hunting targets of his own volition.

 While his actions were unconventional and motives born of dissent, they eventually caught the eye of the Office of Naval Intelligence. With some very specific roles in mind for the rough but talented youth, ONI approached Locke with an offer: come home and let us train you to be even better. Finally sensing an opportunity to find greater purpose, Locke found the strength to let go of his resentment, and entered an extensive training program.

He was a dissenter before, and did not like ONI. If they ask him to do something like kill innocents, or something that violates his morals. He won't do it. Hard evidence? In nightfall when his team member approached him about screwing over everyone else, he vehemently refused even though he could have died and CONSISTENTLY stuck to his morals that entire time. You think he's going to abandon his morals because some asshole in ONI (whom he had resented) ordered him too? Not likely.

If he is after chief, he really believes chief to be in the wrong. I can't even imagine Locke and Chief being black and white enemies. Locke is definitely NOT an ONI lapdog. He might do what they say, but he has limits, plus a dark side to do what needs to be done if he thinks it's for the greater good.  </TEXT>

How many S4s are out there? Same with S3s? It says many got assigned to various branches, and other types of teams like Noble Team exist? If so, do we have any info on them? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Halo 5 needs to have unprecedented custom game options and an amazing forge. Here is my list of things that will foster a great community, amazing games, laughs, and memories. Some of these are features have been in past halo games and were successful; and they should be expanded upon. If these features are implemented, we will see a return of machinima, customs, clans, forgers, and much more content creation. 

- **Easy, fluid UI**. Take Reach for example and add some handy features from 4. I should be able to view who is in my friends game and what they are doing. Plus join in progress option for custom games. And not buggy as hell for fucks sake.

- **clan system**. For the love of God, give us some way to organize our group of friends or clan. This is vital to many players. A way to search and find clans would be great

- **many custom game options**. We should be able to alter the game to our liking for customs. 

- **The forge needs to be amazing**. Big forge maps. Large budget etc etc. Bigger pallet, more vehicles, etc, etc. Creativity is key in all of this. It was suggested that there should be a PC map editor and creator that let's you create awesome detailed maps, then upload to Xbox.

- **More theater and HD capture options**

- **custom games browser or customs matchmaking** even the ability to rent a server would be sweet. 

- **working and active file browser system**  there needs to be something to show off and display peoples work. Whether that be screenshots, maps, videos, or gametypes. I should be able to search users, tags, titles, maps, and gametypes to find content, and you should be able to upload videos that you make in the upload studio and machinima videos to the file browser. Allow for checking file shares pre-game also. This should be available on launch.

I want to go onto halo waypoint.com or forge hub and click a download button, and have it pop up on my Xbox in my stored files.

- this one is the most controversial. **loadouts and armor abilities for custom games** they were always fun to use in mini games and added a fun dynamic to custom games, they did add strategic elements to BTB games. However i do not want them in the arena. I'd also like to be able to alter the power and range of the spartan abilities.

These have no affect on matchmaking or the arena at all and I'd like to know what the community thinks about this. Hopefully 343 can implement these features. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They could do seasonal/biseasonal storylines. Imagine playing as Johnson on harvest or during his S1 days. ODST 2? Or maybe develop John some more by playing as him during the insurrection or a pivotal mission, or even Locke in a spy thriller type thing.

 If they switched it from a firefight hybrid to a full on weekly episodic campaign with cutscenes built in, it would be amazing. With a good couple months between seasons to hype people, it would give thousands of people a reason to start up halo 5 while covering cool canon in the process.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been seeing many redditors say various things about Halo 5, and i do not think there has been an in depth analysis of the gameplay done yet; so here is mine. People were attracted to Halo because it was **competitive and fun**. It allowed people to be creative and bond with others while random objects hurled at you as you struggled to keep balance; then go hardcore competitive on Guardian and fuck people up. Halo 4 failed in both of these regards. This is why I think Halo 5 will be a *quality* Halo game. Although, people will still get pissed off, this has happened with all of the Halo's.

I believe Halo 5 to be the opposite of CoD so let me explain why the game will be a Halo game. I get where most of you are coming from because i was skeptical as well, and of course there are things I don't like and want removed, but the game itself will be competitive and will have a skill gap. It appears to me many didn't look at the gameplay, pro reviews, and vidocs before drawing to conclusions. Although it's possible to dislike the gameplay for various reasons, disliking it for being CoD or casual is where you are wrong. Halo 4 was more Call of Duty than Halo 5 is... by a long shot.

Putting the H5 gameplay on the same level as Call of Duty is absolutely ridiculous; Destiny, Call of Duty, Halo 4, and Titanfall couldn't be further apart from this game. Everything Halo 4 did goes against Combat dynamic that exemplified the previous games. Halo 5 simply does not, it alters it, yet sticks to the values of a Halo game. Plus there are many other things that makes a Halo game other than multiplayer, like campaign which will be nothing short of stellar. 

There is a reason Halo fell out of mainstream popularity by mid halo 3 and people jumped ship to Call of Duty. The gameplay became stale and slow, not because CoD was easier. Then Bungie went and changed it in all the wrong places... at that point 343 continued this trend with Halo 4. And from a market perspective, they had to learn from halo 4 or else they wouldn't have a decent fanbase and their effort null; simple economics. Thus the reason why they hired pro players to advise development around the game; they ***NEED*** h5 to be competitive and fun. So the last thing they are going to make is a no-skill casual game, but a game casuals can enjoy non the less. And they wouldn't just keep the pro's around as PR because it is a waste of money and the pro's wouldn't want to be apart of an organization where they are being used. 

At the moment and for the foreseeable future, there will not be a new good arena (not CoD style) shooter on the market until halo 5, which halo has on lockdown (pun intended lel). It's clearly the corner of the market they are pursuing and rightly so. To get Halo back to where it should be (on top), they need to evolve the gameplay while retaining that arena style, which they (finally) understand. You wanna look at a cash cow, look at CoD. At least 343 cares about the community.

**Mechanics and Values**

Alright, time to get mechanical. When you look at Halo, what makes it great? What makes halo different from all of the rest and not like a CoD game or any of the sort? It boils down to Halo's core values as an arena shooter, something CoD is not; CoD is an arcade shooter. So to make a successful Halo game, it cannot violate a simple core.


**The core values are:**

1. - map control 
2. - power weapon control
3. - skill gap (challenging gameplay)
4. - equal starts 
5. - competitive environment 
6. - Strategic thinking
7. - risk  reward decision making 
8. - simplicity 
9. - fluid map movement

Halo 5 meets every single one of these requirements and I can explain why. 1, 2, 4, 5 are evident by the spartan chatter, power weapon counters, and equal loadouts. The chatter and counters are going to make players more aware of the map and general environment; map and weapon control will be more prevalent in this game then in past Halo's, forcing casuals to be more competitive if they want to win rather than just walking around the map throwing nades and shooting, making them invest time and effort in the game and turning casuals into hardcore fans. 
 
I'll explain further, competitive environment: the game is introducing spartan chatter and weapon counters, changes making the game more accessible... yes. But competitively accessible, so people will be more involved with the game and teamwork will be fostered creating a skill gap and challenging gameplay; which is what halo is all about correct? Currently, most players will walk around the map with no conscious direction. Now more players will be aware of the map and power weapons, causing more fun and tactical carnage. Other factors play into this, these aren't isolated values.

Next is strategic thinking, combine the competitive environment with the movement abilities you will get people being tactical in their next move (unlike halo 4 where sprint had no counter or balance), adds a whole new dynamic. As for the "Cut and run strategy" I agree it isn't halo but it was countered by a variety of aspects in the game including no shield recharge, and you are not at full speed when running. The pro's who bashed halo 4 for the reason people are bashing halo 5 claim the new movement abilities are well balanced compared to Halo 4. It's more of the classic risk-reward aspect which adds strategic ability while sticking to the arena style. You will still be able to fight back if an enemy gets first shot, you will be able to strafe, and out BR noobs.  

Simplicity is justified because, well, it's not as simple as previous installments. But Halo 5 is much simpler than Call of Duty and adds to the strategic element of the game, (unlike CoD) Fluid map movement has a solution, they need to design arena maps with this in mind which they are doing. This still lets crouch jumping happen, but adds to it. No doubt you are going to be able to reach new heights and new ways to engage in combat. I see people crouch jumping so they can clamber onto new areas. All of this contributes to a large skill gap and a skilled game... unlike any other on the market. These are my $0.02

TL;DR: Halo 5 will be a good game with map and power weapon control. Will be competitive arena. I welcome *intelligent* debate.

<TEXT> I'd personally love it. If they actually continued it and did various seasons, 343 could cover many aspects of the universe such as playing as an ODST or marine, Human - forerunner war. They could even go back and make a mission based around ghosts of onyx or any other book. 

Imagine playing Sgt Johnson during the battle of harvest. It would be fucking awesome. The whole episodic campaign thing is a great idea if they made it more campaign like, less firefighty, and 25 episodes per season. Probably a long shot but they could contract episodes to saber and cutscenes to blur.

<TEXT> Halo is a competitive shooter and requires an arena style. I see people flip shit when anything deviates from h2 when it comes to h5. Halo needs to be a fun, challenging, arena shooter but CANNOT solely cater to competitive kids. It should be fun for casuals also and I hope 343 realizes this. I'm going to list how both can be accomplished.

Halo's gameplay has very unique properties that make it fun. I'm not going to go into specifics about game mechanics/ideas, there are tons of community content out there about it, but here are the core requirements halo *must* have to be successful: 

 - **Arena** Equal starts, map control, power weapon control, and tactics. 

 - **Customization** The ability to mold the game to your liking. This includes forge, custom game options, ability to customize your spartan to be unique only to you, and theater options. 

These are things no other current popular game does, halo has a grasp on the market for them; halo's niche. (To clarify, these aspects are not competing with one and other, they can go hand in hand) its very possible to make a game both halo competitive and casual fun. In implementing these things, 343 will have made a fun halo game everyone can enjoy.

In my opinion if 343 services these aspects of the game and expands them further than the previous halo levels of competitive and customization, then we will have a successful halo game. My worry is that 343 will release a game that is too focused on the competitive and just leave out many customization options because a bunch of whiny competitive kids complain when 343i adds something like an option for sprint and loadouts in custom games. When I load up h5, I don't want to feel like I'm playing the MLG playlist, nor some CoD bullshit, but I want it to feel like Halo Team Slayer. Then I want to load some fun custom games with a *24 player lobby*   

I'm interested to read the opinions I've likely generated...
I found this funny: http://imgur.com/L1aZxWJ

EDIT: I believe all additions to halo must meet these basic requirements or at least not hinder them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The issue of gays in scouts. Controversial! Problem and Solution? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-12 23:18:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In recent years, scouts has made headlines for various reasons and many of those has been homosexuals in scouting. Within these headlines we see accounts of sexual abuse in troops on the part of adults and youth and scouts has received a bad name because of it. It has also gotten a bad name because of its policy on not allowing gays in the organization; a rock and a hard place. Like most debates, this one has two equally compelling sides.

BSA has taken many steps attempting to curb sexual abuse in scouting; mainly by enforcing policies. And they recently decided to allow openly gay youth in the organization, but not allowing openly gay adults. The one side says this opens the door to sexual abuse, violates the bible, and that scouting is a religious organization (mainly for the moral guidance imo), also that scouting is a private organization and can conduct itself how it wants. It has been that way for years and is fine, people don't ask if you're gay, you don't tell. No harm done. 

The pro gay side says that it's time to open up scouting for gays and get into the 21st century. It is unfair for people to be excluded based on sexual orientation. Both sides have compelling arguments and BSA knew this. But to the best of my knowledge, BSA gets funding from both human rights organization and religious institutions, both sides threatening to cut funding. Everyone in this sub can agree scouting is a great thing and is one of the best things to happen to this country and that we need more of it. It was already getting bad press before this issue as well as falling numbers, then this happens --- more bad press, people leave on both sides due to the issue. So whichever they picked, people will be upset. And the majority of charters are with churches. Scouting was put in a bad spot.

As a libertarian and an Eagle scout I respect both sides of the argument and in my opinion, it would be easier to simply leave it to the troops, the districts or even the councils. Forcing people to adapt when they aren't ready is an issue as well as excluding them. I believe the troops or people more closely connected with those that would be affected are better apt to make this decision. For example, a troop that has adults that are older more conservative men that have spent years contributing to scouting and are wonderful people with so much knowledge to pass on to youth, or if a troop has young men as leaders that are more open minded. 

Scouting is based around personal responsibility and building leaders as well as developing decision making. The troops/districts/council should be able to decide for themselves. Irdk how anyone will feel about this. I'll probably catch a lot of hate lol.

**Edit/update:** I'd like to make my stance known as I don't hate nor want to exclude gays or atheists, both have a place in scouting if they so choose. I understand why this post gathered as much hate as it did.

 As a young person joins scouts, they generally don't have a concept of sexuality until the middle or HS years, so the issue is irrelevant and is for youth. The issue is not discussed or cared about, most troops will not discriminate as long as the person lives scoutly, my troop wouldn't and few troops would shove a person out based on that, even if the decision is left to councils. And I highly doubt anything would really change, the debate gets overthought beyond what would realistically happen. Very few troops would struggle just as few are now. 

The point of compromise of leaving it up to a council preferably. Is that they can decide whether they are ready for that change, not morally but the affects of it (funding from either side, membership, community support etc.) one way or another, BSA suffers. The argument is irrelevant for youth because they are currently allowed. And if the decision for adults is left to councils. I doubt they would ask off the bat when someone joins... Simply because it doesn't matter unless you're a homophobe and I believe most if not all councils would allow them. 

Atheism has come up quite a few times. Once again, they should not be excluded and most people don't care. The rule states that you must believe in a higher power, that is all. A comment below summed it up nicely as if you believe in aliens as more powerful beings than you pass if you don't happen believe in god. But if by chance you believe humans are alone, then you should be allowed to be openly atheist but must still respect the establishment as it is. For many in scouting, religion is a pillar for moral guidance that helps the scout way and by the time one decides they are atheist, they are adolescent, so they've made the decision. Young people can still use the moral pillar of it .So there is no need to fit the program for a minority even though they should be allowed. This whole thing got blown out of proportion. </TEXT>
