<TEXT> A reminder of Burchill's previous thoughts on male suicide: http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/oct/16/weekend7.weekend6

"Well, if the men who manage football think that 545 under-24 male suicides a year is a more frightening statistic than two women killed each week - and hundreds of thousands injured every year - by the men they live with, then they must be even stupider than they look; though it's hard to imagine, I know. But I can't help feeling they're on very dodgy ground, taking on the young male suicide thing. For a start, it's a phony panic, catering to that lowest of modern male desires - to be a victim"

"That young men succeed in suicide more often than girls isn't really the point. Indeed, the more callous among us would say that it was quite nice for young men finally to find something that they're better at than girls." </TEXT>

Of course the way to fix this is to protect boys from mutilation too,  but anyone supporting mutilation can take the opposite position an argue they're being discriminated against and they should be able to cut girls just as other cut boys. </TEXT>

People opposing MGM are the biggest opponents of FGM - they go further than feminist opponents of the practice and want to protect all victims of mutilation instead of just a small percentage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We need more mental health initiatives.

That's true and mental health may have been one factor here, but I object to this statement on its own - it's now standard response to these cases and pretending that mental health care is the main issue is used to gloss over the abuse men face in our society.

This guy was denied access to his kids, and in most cases these denials of contact are quite clearly wrong. He killed himself in prison, where he had already been subject to violence and it's highly doubtful that he should have even been there in the first place.

If we allow men to be mistreated again and again, and then imprison them for highlighting such abuses (where the abuse continues) then inevitably some will reach breaking point, regardless of whatever mental health care is available.

We need to fix the root causes of these problems, sometimes that's mental health, but mostly it's the shocking way men are abused and mistreated by society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> His imprisonment was as result of his protests, not for any actual crimes: http://newfathers4justice.co.uk/2015/06/06/suffragent-free-haydn-burton/

Of particular note, is that his arrest was at the hands of Hampshire Police, who have also engaged in some extremely distributing practices against the founder of the original Fahters4Justice, a case which also involved alleged misconduct by a Conservative MP. Matt O'Connor of F4J is currently been dragged through the courts by the police and has also been subject to physical attack by Conservatives at his own home!

So in summary, in one county we have a corrupt police force going out of their way to target all fathers rights campaigners who dare to engage with Conservative politicians, and there are very close ties between Conservative politicians in this country and the police force.

Essentially it seems that the the country in question is not a safe place for anyone concerned with equality for fathers. </TEXT>

They're supposed to be unbiased, but they're terrible when it comes to gender issues. It's now basically a feminist organisation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Does that mean the celebration of the US victory is something to be questioned? I don't think so.

If she'd maybe have stayed away from the celebrations then it wouldn't be so bad. Perhaps if the other athletes had come out against domestic violence then it would be a little more tolerable. But if even 10% of the allegations about Solo are true then she shouldn't have been on the team and therefore any victory is going to be tainted by that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I hadn't heard of the idea of men being on the ends of the spectrum and women in the middle. It's a compelling idea but probably not 100% accurate. 

it's absolutely accurate and absolutely the perfect argument to explain the lack of female geniuses and chess grand masters, becasue the differences are by far  the most significant at the genius level extreme of the spectrum.

There's also evidence to suggest that the male curve is shifted very marginally to the right of the female one. This difference is extremely small, but it magnifies the differences at the extreme right of the curve. </TEXT>

Solo went to the nephew/sister's house drunk (in her car). She insulted him about his weight, was asked to leave but then followed them into the house. She then attacked the nephew and he restrained her. After he was persuaded to release her she attacked thim again repeatedly punching him in the face smashing his head into the concrete. Solo's half sister then tried to protect her son, at which point she was then also repeatedly punched in the face by Solo. The nephew grabbed the BB gun t try to get Solo out of the house, and Solo later lied to the police that it had been a real gun.

Both the victims had visible injuries and Solo swore at the police and even threatened them when arrested. </TEXT>

This issue was identified as early as 2007: http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-relief </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Greens really are now the most sexist political party in the UK.

They only want men to go to prison, men appear to be completely sidelined in the party (despite them claiming to have equality when it comes to the leadership and deputy leader position). Can you name a current Green Party figure who isn't female? When did you last see a male from the party sent to be their representative on TV or speaking at one of their press conferences?

Looking at Bennett's background we see she worked for the extremist feminist organisation the Fawcett Society and therefore it's no surprise she comes out with sexist rubbish such as this. No wonder so few males vote for the party. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Mansplaining" is a sexist term invented by feminists so they can avoid debate with men and instead play the victim any time they get something completely wrong.

More recently they've introduced other similar sexist terms such as "manspreading" for when a person supposedly takes up too much space on public transport.

it's quite incredible to see feminists such as Bennett supporting such sexism as feminists pretend to be in favour of gender neutral terminology at all times, yet here they are inventing more and more unnecessarily gendered language (and quite unpleasant and sexist language at that). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is no blatant sexist double standard. Male athletes beat the shit outta females all the time, and get slapped on the wrist

In some of the cases where males have been suspended it was actually the female who attacked first. We see the same double standard in the music industry - Chris Brown gets vilified for abusing his partner, yet Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston, Cheryl Cole all get a pass and in most cases boast about their abuse and sometimes even make money out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who's to say I'm fully in favour of suspension? I'm sharing an interesting video, there's an argument for innocent until proven guilty, though a precedent has been set with many other male athletes, so in the US at least she need suspending. There would be an alternative or reinstating others accused of domestic violence. My main concern is the blatantly sexist double standard rather than taking a stance on which of the two options would be correct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes an argument in early June which exposed the true facts of the case and thus made an extremely compelling case for her suspension, nothing has changed since then has it? Obviously it's a little late now, but the fact is that every game Solo plays just compounds matters and arguably brings shame on the team, making it difficult for fans to get behind them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the second time a woman has boasted about the violence they've perpetrated against Cole, the previous case being his ex-wife who put the remarks about her domestic violence in her autobiography and therefore profited from them.

Neither woman has been subject to the slightest attention from police, despite them both openly confessing to serious violence in writing.

One particular interesting part of the article:

"Carla added: "No-one tried to stop me hitting him  I think that is because of Ashleys bad karma.

I did it for my sister. Ashley has caused her a lot of issues."

<TEXT> The claims in the article are BS. CAFE simply named a number of groups who it hoped to work with. Secondly, there a hundreds and hundreds of studies showing that 50% of dv victims are men so again their claim is true.

Finally, your typical feminist website/pamphlet will contain at least one completely debunked factoid concerning domestic violence (usually several), so if people really have a major problem with misleading claims about dv then they need to start targeting serial offenders, i.e. vast numbers of feminists and feminist organisations (not to mention government departments) </TEXT>

CAFE's original ban (in 2014) went against ever single Pride rule imaginable and was therefore invalid. As for this year, there still hasn't been an actual reason given other than "complaints", the complaint clearly haven't been investigated, nor deemed as valid reasons for barring Pride.

**Pride are now in a situation where anyone can make any complaint about any group and as long as there are a dozen of such complaints then that group can be banned forever!** It doesn't matter how ridiculous or false the complaints happen to be, the organisation just gets banned simply becasue of a handful of ridiculous or politically motivated complaints. </TEXT>

Furthermore, in the example you cite those involved have apologised and accepted that they did terrible things, Solo has failed to apologise for her conduct and actually attempts to play the victim!

I agree she's innocent until she's found guilty, though I'm also certain that no male in her position would be representing the US team and we really should be treating all athlete equally regardless of gender.

<TEXT>   if the first thing in their manifesto wasn't about restricting women's access to abortions

The format of the manifesto is chronological - i.e. it deals with foetuses, then babies, then children and then adults. Also, while I'm not all that enthusiastic about the inclusion of the abortion proposals, it's incredible how people try to twist it to pretend it's extreme. In reality, according to this link, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6235557.stm the party is only proposing the exact same time limit as in place in **Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia**. It's the current UK limit of 24 weeks which is the extreme and out of touch policy relative to other developed nations. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That's because it's mother's groups and child protection groups making progress, not us.

True, though I haven't seen much involvement from mother's groups in this case, it's the intactivists who've been at the forefront of this. their case is certainly made a hell of a lot easier with the mother being pitted against the father in this instance but whatever the case this is still a major victory for us right now. I certainly haven't ever heard of a case of a hospital and doctor wanting to mutilate a boy and then backing out at the last minute entirely thanks to a campaign to save him from their knife. And if we make it unacceptable for the hospital to mutilate Chase against his will then the natural extension of this process is to make it unacceptable for hospitals  to mutilate any kids just for the hell of it.

The lack of a bedroom subsidy actually hits separated fathers far harder than anyone else becasue their don't have primary custody of the kids therefore they don't get to have a bedroom for their kids, meaning no overnight stays becasue there's no suitable place for the kids to sleep. </TEXT>

If the only concern is a few angry phone calls then I'd say the protesters are showing a huge amount of restraint and should be commended for remaining peaceful and conducting the protests in a lawful manner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chase's genital mutilation is scheduled for Thursday 11th June at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Florida. I'm sure I don't need to explain the details of this case, but here's some background for those who are new to it: http://savingchase.org/news 

**Please help to protect Chase by letting the hospital know what they're doing is completely unethical, non consensual and constitutes severe child abuse.**

You can phone the hospital on 954-265-5324

Tweets should go to @JDCHospital and they've posted on their Facebook about the controversy, with the post currently open to replies

There will also be protests outside the hospital: 1005 Joe Dimaggio Drive http://intactnews.org/node/807/1433866992/dr-gary-birken-protest 

    
Please also share various articles about the case on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter: http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/breaking-news/reports-of-boys-looming-circumcision-cause-campaig/nmYwp/  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, the number of deaths is pretty small when you consider the number of circumcisions carried out. Far more common are lesser complications from the surgery, such as infections and the loss of all or parts of the penis. You won't exactly hear a lot of guys talking about that either becasue it's not exactly something people will mention for fun is it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The key men's rights info is found a long way down in the article. It reads as follows:

 Ethan, who was born in January 2012, has lived with his mother since his parents split up in February 2013. 

 Legal proceedings between his parents began a month later when Mr Williams applied for contact with Ethan.

 Magistrates ordered that he should have contact with Ethan in the presence of Ms Minnock from August 2013, but this broke down two months later.

 In January 2014 Ms Minnock made allegations against Mr Williams. These were all rejected by a district judge in April 2014.

 In February, a district judge found further allegations by Ms Minnock had been 'fabricated' to 'frustrate contact'.  </TEXT>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxqGrAIYDY list=UUAFZs5cx3bu-0hYHmBu1tsg

You can "dislike" a video then simply press "next" (the double arrow facing right) to skip to the next one. It takes about 5 minutes to dislike every single one of their videos!

Almost all videos have comments open too, so one you've finished with Facebook start commenting on their videos too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Any person (man or woman) who is likely to abuse their partner will not change their behaviour because of a poster. 

I'd disagree in this particular case. You're correct that any poster which simply repeats messages already firmly embedded into the attitudes of society will have zero impact (e.g. "never hit a woman"). Violence against men, particularly by women, is seem as acceptable, deserved and even comedic. Therefore an innovative poster campaign that actually confronts problematic prevailing attitudes is actually of real value.

The posters may not be enough to stop most female abusers, but it may cause bystanders to say something o (or at least not applaud and laugh). </TEXT>

Any request for a"follow up piece" is nonsensical due to the different ways the organisations are funded - if the BBC wants to be as bad as the papers then it needs to abolish the licence fee first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That seems like a pretty ageist statement. Clearly young men are hugely impacted by sexism in society, though there's a hell of a lot of issues for older men to face too. Young men generally don't have kids (or at least haven't' been through a terrible divorce and lost all contact with them (and most of theri money) while still paying child support). Suicide also impacts on old and young men alike and wihle treatment for younger men's cancers is pretty good, it's the older men with prostate cancer who are the ones facing real discrimination and appalling care.

If age rally bothers you, then you'll be pleased to know that (from what I've seen) most of the senior members of CAFE are all pretty young, though tbh I think it's great to have a whole mix of ages (and genders) working together and above all else the best and most dedicated person for the job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I'm something of an expert on Symantec's filter and it's impact on men's rights site. I wrote numerous articles on this issue back in 2013 and complied lists of sites it's blocks as "hate". I've gone right to teh top of the company with my concerns and their policy of smearing and defaming the overwhelming majority of men's human rights sites as "hate" is entirely deliberate and they're not planning on changing the classifications.

Some articles:

<TEXT> Hi Suzanne,

I really admire how you decided to make shared parenting a part of your manifesto. UKIP are the only major party to do this and I'd really like to thank you personally for the work you've done in this area

There are also a great many other equality issues concerning men and boys, all of which are also totally ignored by LibLabCon and I was wondering if you'd looking into any of these? For example we currently have the genital mutilation of children funded by the NHS (without their consent) and there are vast gender inequalities (all caused by the state) in relation to cancer care, domestic violence support, education and the justice system.

I really feel that if you took the same approach to the above issues that you've taken to parenting, then you'd gain even more support next time around (and of course it's the right thing to do as well). Would love you hear your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the difference is that she has already graduated and therefore the university cannot do much directly. It's the Student's Union that is being hateful by continuing to employ her.

I wonder if there are other options open to the University, if they can't discipline her directly and if the SU refuses to do the right thing then perhaps they could just ban her from campus? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some openly oppose it, others just try to sabotage the legislation and come up with random esxcuses why it shouldn't happen. The best known case is opposition to hared parenting by the National Organization of Women in the US (one of the biggest feminist organisations in the world):

https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/20980-as-it-was-and-ever-shall-be-now-opposes-equal-rights-for-fathers

http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/opposing-shared-parenting-the-feminist-track-record/

The good news is that exposes of the track record of such groups has led to them purging the proof of their opposition to equal parenting rights from their websites, so they do at least seem to be becoming ashamed of that fact they openly opposed shared parenting </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think I finally met a Tory politician I like.

Same here, though the problem is that he's very much a Tory rebel rather than the norm. I expect he'd be popular with the grass roots of the party, the problem is that those in charge are mostly nothing like him really.


The fact that they've got one really good MP doesn't really make the rest of them any less shitty and out of touch with reality (though it does help a little that he's got a position of at least some importance).

It's also noteworthy that Raab has barely mentioned gender issues in the 4 years that have passed since he made these comments. I guess the various attacks from Labour, the BBC and the left are quite effective at silencing people from speaking uncomfortable truths. </TEXT>

There's been a very noticeable decline in the quality of newspapers here, the latest example being the Telegraph which haemorrhaged almost every single one of its best writers over the last few years. It has gone from perhaps the best UK newspaper as recently as 2008-10 to an average publication today. Therefore new developments such as the launch of Breitbart London are extremely welcome. </TEXT>

It's true that the original racist/sexist incident was weeks ago, but this is a new report, which outlines her response to the allegations of racism and sexism. I.e. it is a brand new development, with a number of different outlets all picking it up today.

Of course, most areas will have zero pro men's human rights candidates, though it's still worth doing your research. Furthermore, if there's a misandrist feminist standing in your area (or perhaps a pro-MGM religious nutjob) then please just go out and vote for any of their opponents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Labour still beats the Lib Dems hand down when it comes to misandry.

Two of their equality ministers (harman and Hewitt) were found guilty of sexism against men, with one also given repeated official warnings from the statistics authority for lying about the gender pay gay.

I'd say the misandry of Labour's Vera Baird alone matches everything the Lib Dems have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In legal matters there's a commonly used Latin expression which is as follows: **"Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius"**. This translates to "The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another."

Such an expression might not be of much relevance were there numerous parties ignored by De Piero, or if there was another excuse or it it was sheer forgetfulness (for example if Mike hadn't showed p to the count or if she didn't know his name/party). However, Mike went out of his way to target De Piero and highlight her misandry and it's pretty obviously she's deliberately chosen the words she used. Even if she was so bitter an childish that she had decided against acknowledging him specifically she could have said " Helen, or Philip, or Simon and others" then that would have been ok. This didn't happen and therefore it's more than reasonable to assume she's against helping anyone who voted for J4MB unless she says otherwise.

Did you even read the article. They've already given a load of praise to a fringe party that isn't' even standing yet.

Furthermore, it's not really about airtime at all, but fair treatment. Had the BBC given 10 times a more coverage to J4MB than they did but continuing with the same spin and bias then everyone would have exactly the same concerns. </TEXT>

It's far from exclusively an LGBT issue of course, and almost all aspect of men's health are underlooked/ignored by most politicians. However, of the 2,000 male lives every year, gay/bi men would be massively over represented.

Shame we don't see the LGBT lobby up really focus on this instead of the insignificant issues that do get attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Politicians won't support the MRM, but they will look at specific issues (especially if they're cheap to back).

Almost all men's issues are cheap to back or even have a significant gain for taxpayers. The government clearly hates men, otherwise they'd have implemented the cost saving ones ages ago just to save cash.

* Getting rid of MGM (actually makes money for the NHS in cost savings)
* Fixing family courts (basically free and saves money in legal costs)
* Shared parenting (free, though loses the CSA their cut of child support) </TEXT>

<TEXT> J4MB are standing in two constituencies (was originally three) and plan to contest 50 next time around. The other candidate wasn't invited to his own hustings debate, therefore making this far worse than you suggest.

Also, I don't see why boys get their genitals mutilated without their consent (and at taxpayer expense) whilst females get protected by law. That's probably the party's strongest policy and it gets huge support. </TEXT>

They obviously don't like the party so decided to do everything within their powers to intimidate its members and sabotage their election campaign? The BBC is well know for it's left-wing SJW bias, though this particular example is particularly blatant even by their standards.

<TEXT> A few questions I asked in my complaint:

1. What is your organisation's justification for banning men (and the discussion of their issues) from only UK hustings on the BBC to feature the political party in the western world representing the human rights of men and boys? Do you at least now accept it was clearly a mistake to do so?

2. Why couldn't a non J4MB seat be chosen instead?

3. Which member(s) of staff were responsible for imposing this gender based discrimination at such an historic event?

4. Why was Ray Barry not invited to his own hustings? Who was responsible for failing to send out his invites? Was this bias a deliberate act or supposedly a mistake?

5. When can we expect to see a men-only hustings discussing men's issues on BBC Nottingham prior to the 2015 General Election in order to ensure fairness and gender balance in your output?

6. When will Ray Barry get his chance to appeal to voters on BBC Radio Nottingham before the election?

7. How many members of staff at BBC Nottingham have a gender-feminist political outlook and are therefore naturally hostile towards the human rights of men and boys and/or J4M B? Did any of the individuals who are hostile or dismissive of J4MB have any role in this scandal?

8. Why was the very existence of J4M B portrayed as a problem on the Midlands Daily Politics broadcast? Why was Ray Barry yet again airbrushed out of existence?

9. When will we finally see the party engaging on-air with its supporters or at least the very many supporters of its ideas?

10. You all follow various political parties and local political personalities on Twitter, yet not a single one of you follow someone as high profile as Mike Buchanan. How do you expect to keep your listeners informed of stories relating to local politics if you're all blatantly ignoring one the the area's most significant political figures, someone who attracts global interest?

11. Have you apologised to Mike and Ray for the horrendous mistreatment of them and their party by BBC Radio Nottingham? If not when are you going to apologise? (I'd suggest doing so publicly, on air and BEFORE the election, not afterwards).

12. When are you also going to apologise to your male listeners for denying them a voice?

<TEXT> It doesn't matter what their political position is, the BBC have clearly attempted to sabotage their election prospects.

Secondly, ignoring the slight Conservative bias, the fact is that 75% of the manifesto is mostly spot on and covers hugely important equality issues that get sept under the carpet. Furthermore, if there's specific media and entertainment industry ethics issues you'd want them to cover, or any mistakes you've spotted, then drop them a line in a couple of weeks. They do tend to be quite receptive to feedback. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note that they also rigged most of the questions so they were about women's issues, therefore preventing J4MB from discussing its manifesto.

They also held a second (mixed gender) debate in the constituency of the second J4MB candidate, though they didn't actually bother to invite him to take part! (and he's their best speaker)

**Therefore the BBC has completely banned men in from any interaction whatsoever with the only men's party in the UK.**

The BBC is funded by a compulsory licence fee, and as a result is duty-bound to be impartial. What they have done breaks countless BBC editorial guidelines and it's blatantly obvious that they have directly interfered in the apolitical process and attempted to sabotage the campaign of a party who's views they disagree with.

<TEXT> Yet more BBC anti J4MB bias, not very subtle are they? Firstly note how the whole tone of the piece so negative and putting Mike up against his biggest opponent in the entire constituency. The whole premise is one of a feminist outraged with the very existence of a party supporting the human rights of men and boys. Plenty of people hate Labour or the Tories, but they don't simply restrict Labour in Rotherham to a grilling by a victim of the industrial scale child abuse there do they? Similarly even the BBC wouldn't put UKIP in front of a panel consisting 100% of Romanian immigrants

Where's the video showing him engaging with unemployed men or all the grandparents (male and female) denied a relationship with their grandkids? They're just constantly trying to put him under attack so he's on the defensive.

Mike also states that they interviewed his colleague Barry Barry, who is now a highly experienced and quite superb performer in such discussions. Naturally they shelved every minute of Ray's excellent performance and even give the last word to the feminist. 

(when they went back to the studio after this piece they even named check the feminist again and failed to mention J4M B or Mike or Ray) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Mirror is a feminist newspaper (and a tabloid one at that), they are running a smear campaign against him. That's not to say he's perfect, but his party is 100 times more trustworthy and honest than this source.

Even teh headlines is nonsense - the main issue was that teh discussion was about women's issues and thus the BBC was again marginalising men. He'd happily discuss his manifesto in front of any audience of any gender, but the BBC were clearly attempting to stop him from doing so by rigging the discussion format. </TEXT>

100% of BBC debates featuring J4M B feature all female audiences. Thus men have been banned from each and every BBC J4M B election discussion.

There is not a single opportunity anywhere for any man to engage with the party that represents them on the BBC.

<TEXT> Read the J4M B manifesto for all 20. A few off the top of my head:

* A sexist education system
* Almost zero support for the 40% of domestic violence victims who happen to be male
* Genital mutilation of girls is illegal yet is NHS funded on boys
* Different prison sentences for teh same crime depending on your gender.
* Zero rights for fathers, only responsibilities.
* Huge inequalities in healthcare spending based on gender, even on condition with the same number of deaths: e.g. prostate vs breast cancer

As for your point about men in Parliament, well its women who voted to put them there and simply democracy in action. Who voted for the BBC to ban men from their audience, I certainly wasn't asked and I doubt the candidates were either.

<TEXT> I think he was just extremely angry at being stiched up by the BBC. he has invested countless hours campaigning, fund-raising, writing the manifesto etc, only to have his biggest media appearance ruined by a rigged audience and rigged line of questioning. On top of all that his party colleague was completely excluded from the only other debate too. It's a complete scandal and the sort of thing you'd expect the Guardian to do, not a supposedly neutral broadcaster.

Update - Mike now reports that the BBC attempted to justify the all female audience based on the fact that 52% of the electorate is female

Politicians happen to be male, but male voters are outnumbered by females and politicians are notorious for pandering to female voters. J4M B outline 20 areas in which the state discriminates against men and boys, with no one able to provide a single example of the state doing the same to women. Thus reality is the complete opposite to what you describe.

Demand both an all male audience for a debate in future not to mention a full interview with Ray Barry before the election and also an apology.

You can also find him on Twitter.

As long as spending on the child exceeds the father's contribution then there's no major issue. I'm talking about when the child has to go without due to the mother blowing child support on a luxuries for herself, something that can sometimes happen just to try to spite the father.

It's very simple - the law needs to state that chils support HAS to be spent on things that benefit the child. </TEXT>

No it isn't, the mother would easily be able to demonstrate that all the money (and more) went towards things for the child.

You're missing the point, there should be something in the law that states child support is to be spent on raising the child. If the mother has designer handbags and 100 pairs of shoes (and no job) and the child barely has any clothes, toys, books etc then there's something wrong and it should be illegal. </TEXT>

Child support is paid to the mother who's free to spend it entirely on herself.

<TEXT> I expect the main reason is sexism against men and that the concept of targeting female abusers simply wouldn't appeal to a bloodthirsty audience, many of whom don't like to think females can even be paedophiles (unless the victim is female too).

They may be other factors too though. For example, most female paedophlies I've read about tend to abuse people they already know. It wouldn't be possible for catch a predator to confront all the female predators in our schools, nurseries etc, nor all those sexually abusing their own children or children of close relatives, so maybe the pattern of offending is different?

<TEXT> The stat in the article has been debunked and either complete nonsense or at best a massive exaggeration. At the current rate of change men would be extinct in many billions of years.

<TEXT>  Caving in when confronted by hysterical Breitbart witch hunts

The suspension occurred before Breitbart got involved - they're reporting on the suspension and didn't write anything prior to this action.

Even assuming the tweets are a "joke", then presumably is ok for other politicians to have joked about rape or cockle pickers etc? 

And if we're truly looking at things in context, then we have to include the wider context of Noble's very clear dislike of men and their human rights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In defence of some Lib Dem bodies, it seems that many were unaware of her views before this. The local branch have now acted properly (or at least started to process of doing so), as have the Secular and humanist Lib Dems.

The problem is the other two Lib Dem committees - other redditors have expressed concern about previous goings on at the LGBT Lib Dems in particular. The response of Lib Dem HQ has also been hopeless, all I can guess is perhaps they have to leave things to Noble's local party or something?

Furthermore, the Lib Dems are mostly quite a moderate party, so she's working for the wrong organisation. if she wants to make insane hate tweets she's free to try to get a similar role in the Green party or even labour where I'm sure she'd be welcomed with open arms.

People usually volunteer to work in such position in the hope of getting a more senior /elected role later (which would be paid).

Quite frankly, if she'd have deleted the tweets the moment we exposed them and apologised then she wouldn't' be in such a deep hole today and non one would have pursued the matter. She's the one who's left the tweets in place and continued along the same path. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On a similar theme to the prisons question, I'd be interested to know the following. What is the Green Party's source for their domestic violence policy which states:

*"it is acknowledged that a large majority of cases involve abuse by men against women".*

The UK crime survey is considered by far the most reliable source for such material, and that shows 40% of victims were men, a pattern that's been seen for years in study after study. Furthermore, such studies don't even usually identity the gender of the abuser, again suggesting their statement is extremely dubious and this looks like more feminist sexist to go along with the prions policy.

<TEXT> In 2015 sexist feminists are the norm I'm afraid, and it's genuinely egalitarian feminists such as Christine Hoff Sommers who are the exception.

Feminism might have been about equality in 1960, but looking at the behaviour of most feminists then it's clear that isn't the case today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bennett seems to be the typical sort of sexist feminist, something that's all too common today.

If you read up on her background she worked for the Fawcett Society, an organisation synonymous with promoting special treatment and ever more privileges for women (whilst doing absolutely nothing to address any issues that impact men). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sceptical about a lot of these supposedly expert reports, and the most important thing is often to uncover any bias (or stupidity) of the author or research it is based upon.

They tend to be a mixed bag really, for example the Stern review into rape was fantastic by all accounts, whereas the Norgrove report into shared parenting was based on complete lies and has since been completely debunked, with a researcher taking issue into a completely false interpretation of her work.

I imagine this research is more Norgrove-like than Stern-like and at best it only tells half the story. For example it's absolutely true that an awful lot of women who are in prison simply don't belong there (tv licence evaders for example). However, what the various researchers and pressure groups fail to mention is that such prisoners are at least matched and almost certainly outnumbered by the vast proportion of female criminals who benefit from bias in the justice system at every single stage (and therefore should currently be locked up in place of the other women).

Up to 20% of peadophiles are women yet there number in prison is absolutely tiny. Similarly, women are actually more likely to initiate domestic violence against their partner than the other way round and at least 40% of domestic violence victims are men, yet the number pf women actually prosecuted for violence and abuse of men is still very small, and the actual number imprisoned smaller still.

The entire present narrative on this issue is essentially a complete lie. The idea that the justice system overall discriminates against women is the complete opposite of reality, and we have judges openly admittng they'd have given harsher sentences to female criminals had they been male. Philip Davies MP gave an excellent speech in Parliament a while back outlining this, which I'd recommend to anyone interested in the topic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a satisfactory answer from Bennett, there's absolutely no need to single out women if a term such as "parents" would be more valid.

 many are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, many have mental health issues

All these things also apply to men, and men are subject to more violence overall than women too. I also note on the same policy page the Party blatantly lies about domestic violence, stating: "it is acknowledged that a large majority of cases involve abuse by men against women".

This is totally false - the UK crime survey shows that 40% of domestic violence victims are men, so the number of women who are victims is 60% at most. However, that survey ignores children  taking the number of women easily below 50% and that's still women abused by anyone. DV is particularly high in lesbian relationships so this amazingly specific crime of violence by men against women is smaller still. The Green Party i lying about domestic violence and then it uses this lie to attempt to justify it's sexist prison policy.

Anyway thanks for the link, I was already a firm believer that Greens needed to get rid of Bennett, and if she's also one fo those responsible for introducing such shockingly sexist policies then she really needs to go ASAP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with this strategy is that it can be interpreted as sexual, and there's an increasing amount of opposition in society to heterosexual men being open about sexual matters and a general tendency to demonise men and sex.

There is already a fairly strong pro foreskin movement within the gay community and that seems to work ok, and it would also work for women to express their desire and attraction for men with a natural penis. However, different rules apply to most men it can be slightly risky to celebrate the foreskin too much. Obviously it's nothing like the same as circumfetishists who gets their kicks out of mutilating kids, but clearly the best strategy is to attack such child abusers.

To be honest there's nothing to celebrate about having a foreksin becasue that's just normal isn't it and how things are meant to be? We don't celebrate having legs or arms do we? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But given that national GDP changes were factored into the Australian study

Yes but is that simply GDP or GDP per capita? Under the Tories GDP has risen but only becasue they keep immigration at or near to Labour's previously huge levels, the average person is no better off. Furthermore, men are often left behind and on the scrap heap even during a recovery, so even though most people might be getting richer they could still be suffering in silence. For example labour decimated manufacturing in this country through mis-rule and closed down male industries such as mining. Thatcher continued with some of the closures and didn't' exactly help matters, but ultimately it was Labour who did a lot of the damage.

Ultimately, suicide is now mostly a male issue and all the Tories are pretty bad, it's still the case that the most anti-male agenda comes from Labour (and similar parties elsewhere in the world). We could cut suicide massively if we dealt with the awful family courts, actaully helped the 40% of domestic violence victims who are men, dealt with the sexist justice and prison system, introduced shared parenting and actually took men's health seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't read it in full, though one issue is that many suicides are a result of years of depression and long term factors such a failed relationships, unemployment. So for examples, someone would have lost their job and their house etc under the crash of the economy under Labour, though the associated depression wouldn't have resulted in their actual suicide until the coaltion were in power.

Also, I know for a fact that certain departments at the University of Bristol have some absolutely vile people with the most extreme views on issues and as a result I wouldn't trust half the research associated with that particular University (and I'd go so far as to assuming the exact opposite was true in many cases). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This J4M B fund-raiser represents great value for money activism so please get involved if you can.

The way UK electoral system works is that each party gets one leaflet delivered free of charge by the Royal Mail wherever they are standing. Therefore donors only need fund the printing cost and then the leaflet gets delivered **free of charge.**

Given that the cost of postage on the UK equates to about 53 pence (80 cents), **you're basically getting $9 worth of services for every dollar you give!**

I'd challenge anyone to find a better value way of donating to men's human rights causes right now.

Donation are accepted from abroad as long as they are less than 5,000

Here's an article with further info:

<TEXT> Actually his would be pretty damn good if it included gender.  It gives excelletnt results if we include this or assume gender to be a culture. 

1. No. I cannot mostly be with other males at college/university as higher education classes are now female dominated across the western world.

2. No. Young women earn more than young men and many adverts for renting accommodation explicitly ban males, thus making it hard to access housing.

3. No. As a male, I'm far more likely to face violence than females, someone of this is likely to be by those living in my street.

4. Yes, though there are attempts by some to reduce the protein I need to consume to remain healthy.

5. No. men are demonised in the media, regularly stereotyped either as idiots, incapable parents, or as violent and abusive.

6. No. All the world's problems tend to be blamed on men, usually white men.

7. Strange question.

8. Yes, but the gaming industry is already under attack and music seems to be the next target so probably not safe for much longer.

9. This doesn't' happen to any group that I'm aware of, though in some places men are often punished becasue of their gender when buying car insurance

10. I don't have any "borthers", but whatever they are I'm sure that as a male  I'm burdened with protecting them and putting myself in harms way to do so.

11. If I use curse words it will probably be considered abusive or threatening behaviour becasue of my gender.

12. The justice system is known to discriminate against all males on a mass scale and to a huge extent. Any discrimination against ethnic minorities by the justice system is completely dwarfed by the scale of discrimination on the ground of gender. Were I a female doing so I'd simply be considered "empowered".

13. Happens to both men and women, though actually probably more so women.

14. Happens all the time. "Teach men not to rape" even a state sponsored "men can stop rape" campaign. Why am I supposed to stop men and women raping each other simply becasue of my gender?

15. Depends. Certainty not in many schools, nor in a lot of taxpayer funded institutions.

16. One domestic violence shelter for men in the whole of Canada despite half of victim being men, and will probably be arrested instead of the perpetrator if I call the police as a victim of domestic violence. Widespread discrimination in medical research against males (e.g. cancer). And if I'm on a sinking ship I'll be the last to be rescued! </TEXT>

Well I agree your point apples to a lot of feminists and a lot of users of the block bots, but some people will be duped into using these block lists thinking they are genuine tools to block offensive users when they're actually 100% political.

Hearing well-argued and logical dissenting views really is a useful thing and of course there's the Twitter block function for dealing with very isolated incidents of harassment and blatant trolls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, though surely any sane person would want to use a bot that operates as described, and actually blocks sexism and hate, and these bots just don't do that.

They certainly claim be about helping people avoid some of the nastier accounts on Twitter, yet in reality many of those on the list are simply there becasue they dared to disagree or even question a particular aspect of extremist feminism.

The bots aren't about making the twitter experience any more pleasant or safer for Twitter users, they're simply political tools used to silence dissent and simply make Twitter into an echo chamber for those using them. </TEXT>

Pretty cowardly of them not to give their name, and it's also despicable for the newspaper to grant anonymity to a writer for no other reason that the fact that their comments are hateful and possibly illegal.

<TEXT> This is as much about the Lib Dems as it is about feminism (if not more so).

There were clearly countless man hating feminists in attendance at NUS Women 2015 (probably more than almost anywhere else in the country). These misandrist feminists will always exist and I guess they're entitled to get together and do whatever they want. However, if people want to get involved with such extremism and actually express such vile views about half the population then there should be no place for them in the Lib Dems and they certainly should have roles on no less than 3 Lib Dem exec committees.

Ultimately, if Lib Dem exec members go out of their way to spread hatred against half the electorate than how do they ever expect to win any seats? They might pick up the self-loathing male vote, though tbh Labour and the Greens already pretty much have that tiny section of the electorate to themselves already. </TEXT>

And I'm not spreading any harassment campaign - she's the one promoting removing men form society and putting men in the bin.

<TEXT> The violence and fire alarm pulling in Toronto involved large numbers of people, many feminists were involved and they even recruited trade union officials to support what they did. The criminal acts and obscene harassment happened repeatedly at least 4 separate men's issues evens over the space of more than a year. You can watch video of every single incident on Youtube

For the details on feminists supporting female paedophiles read about what happened too Michelle Elliot, who pioneered research into this area (she founded Kidscape too). There's a video interview of Michelle on youtube which is essential viewing, though the main channel has been taken down so I'd need to find you a mirror. edit- i found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzC6OfPj82I

Your point about men getting custody when they "ask" for it is meaningless. Most know they have zero chance and thus are advised not to even bother trying in court and wasting huge sums of moeny. Rich men get custody and those where the mother is clearly unfit - that's about it.

Here's a source for a feminist organisation doubting that fasle rape allegations even exist:
http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2010/02/does-the-moon-really-exist.html

Your final point sis wrong in the US, particularly colleges, who have now officially switched to a preponderance of evidence weighting for rape allegations thanks to feminists:

<TEXT> Just try to say open a men's centre at a Univeristy (whre men are a significant minority) and feminists will oppose it  ruthlessly.

Try to organise a talk on male suicide by Warren Farrell and feminists will blockade the event, use violence and scream abuse at attendees and pull fire alarms risking everyone's safety.

Try to organise a conference on female paedophiles (who typically abuse boys) and feminists will protest it.

Try to point out that 40% of dv victims are men and they need shelters, feminists will lie and agree and oppose funding for such facilities.

Feminist organisations openly campaign against shared parenting, and campaign for women to have custody of children. They deny that false rape accusations even exist (thus meaning all the male victims of false rape allegations who comitt suicide therefore don't really exist). They hijacked the domestic violence shelters in this country for political purposes and forced the pro-equality founder out of her own organisation becasue she dared to not that a lot of the women in the shelters were also pretty violent and abusive themselves and therefore dv wasn't a gender issue.

Feminists are even attakcing men in the justice system, removing even the most fundamental of rights such as the concept of innocece before proven guilty.

I'm not saying their aren't other obstacles to equality for males, and the more conservative/macho attitude of some doesn't' help. However, it's feminists that are now by far the strongest, most vocal, most committed and most successful opponents of the human rights of men. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the hell does retiring or standing down have to do with representing one's constituents in Parliament. Either they're people's MP or they're not. Are you saying they get to stop early becasue they're not after people's vote next time and so don't have to do their job properly? They should be supporting shared parenting becasue it's the right thing to do, not just to get votes.

I suppose you make a fair point about minister's sometimes tending not to sign, though in most cases the sexism accusations still stand for those MPs, particularly Lynne and Lorely (and increasingly so for Jo too). Lynne has a very long history of terrible sexism against men and it's a scandal she's ever been allowed near any equalities position given her obvious contempt for half the population. How often did you actually see her actually do her job and pushed for shared parenting (or for any significant equal rights for men and boys for that matter). I hear that Lorely is quite the sexist too, with Jo now also getting in on the action and actually campaigning against any progress toward equality when it doesn't benefit women: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9764984/Womens-very-unfair-Christmas-present-car-insurance-price-hike.html </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is an issue that disproportionately affects men, so it is unsurprising to me that it would attract proportionally more male signatories.

Except we're told that the reason we need female MPs is that they'll all be far less macho, and instead of focusing on big engineering schemes and the military, they'll push for equality and for breaking down gender roles. Thus, were the female MPs to act as we were todl they would, then their support for shared parenting woudl be significantly igher than the support from men.

Furthermore, this is not simply a men's issue. Child are damaged hugely by a lack of relationship with their fathers (both boys and girls), and wrongly exclusing the father from a child's life almost always goes in hand with excluding grandparents, uncles and aunts etc

Anyway, thanks for checking the stats, there seems to have been a rounding error and so 12 looks to be the correct figure. (BTW  60% represents how many extra female MPs would have been needed were the number of male supporters adjusted downwards - i.e. if the 104 figure was fixed) </TEXT>

<TEXT>   the fact of the matter is that vast majority of domestic violence is male to female

Utter nonsense, literally hundreds to studies show gender symmetry in terms of perpetration of domestic violence. Yes a lot more males abusers are found in police statistics, but that's simply due to the failure to seek out, report and arrest females perpetrators. When you actually look at more reliable indicators such as crime surveys you find huge numbers of male victims and female perpetrators.

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.5578 rep=rep1 type=pdf

To further emphasise just how false your remark is, just think about all differnet types of domestic violence out there that we ignore. For example there's domestic violence against children, a notable aspect of which is the tendency of mothers to abuse boys much more than girls. also think about homosexual relationship, which many studies note are the most violent of any type. The idea that domestic violence is almost always men abusing women is quite simply a lie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note the BBC's bias here (and the media generally)

What we have is a set of laws that refuses to protect innocent male babies from dangerous, non-consesnual and irreversible mutilation, with such barbaric practices even funded and supported by the taxpaer! On the other hand, the same laws are  over-protective of females to such an extent that the laws becomes concerned with mere piercings on consenting adults.

It's obvious that males are subject to extreme discrimination by the government, yet the BBC has to pretend it's females are the victims despite the reverse obviously being the case. </TEXT>

For a start you can share J4M B links and videos, follow them on Twitter and retweet them. Comments on articles about J4M B help too.

Donations from abroad are also permitted just as long as they're not thousands and thousands of pounds.

Feedback is good too, for example you can suggest improvements and submit better academic sources for any weaker parts of the Manifesto.

They don't' even have a Wikipedia article yet either so perhaps someone could help with that also. </TEXT>

Anyway i will make a text post soon after getting some more specific details of when people are needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not familiar with Symantec's politics, although I found one person involved to be a feminist (though she was only responsible for defending the sexism and not in charge of the actual filter technology).

It does occasionally block really extreme feminist sites, though generally it does seem that the "hate" classification gets triggered by  the transphobic content on those sites and it generally doesn't appear to be programmed to block  sites containing hate speech directed at men. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw that censorship of men's human rights sites was a hot topic right now so best re-post some of my investigative work into the matter. I wrote this article over two years ago but it's all still 100% accurate today becasue nothing has changed, 

I'm probably the foremost expert on the censoring of men's human rights sites by web filters and I've written 5 or 6 articles investigating exactly what's going on and which companies use the filters.

I'll share more of those articles later or others are free to post them. If anyone has any questions on this issue I'll be able to answer most of them fairly easily and accurately.

Some further reading of my research into the matter:

<TEXT> Hi, I've written more about the blocking of men's human rights sites than probably anyone else out there.

There are actually quite a few school who use the Symantec filtering system. It blocks men's human rights sites as "hate sites" so your school is probably better than a lot of others and at least only censoring instead of also defaming organisations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Bloodstained Men are a excellent and extremely long running intactivist group who campaign against male genital mutilation in America.

They're great at raising awareness and confronting those performing and endorsing MGM. They're targeting the north-east this year due to it's higher than average rates of MGM (over 70%!) so its' really important to challenge attitudes in such states in order to protect children from this form of abuse.

A few videos of them in action for those who haven't seen them yet:

* [Protest in Denver] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsdPE4AC0g)
* [Interesting exchange in Tuscaloosa, Alabama] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-PujOfGYZ8)
* [Protest at the AAP convention in San Diego] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGPu4jB_L2g)


They're looking to raise $5K and at the time of making this post they are at $2,140, here's the donation page:

http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/help-fund-the-2015-northeast-bloodstained-men-tour/294627

These guys work hard and have even been wrongly arrested while protesting, so they deserve our full support.

<TEXT> Any supposed benefits of MGM will never outweigh the risks and harm caused. It's obvious that important body parts should never be amputated unless they are diseased or damaged beyond repair.

Butchering kids genitals just for the hell of it and without their consent is sickening child sex abuse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too was suspicious about the likelihood of a genuinely right-wing party proposing such a thing, and it's actually almost completely false to categorise this party as right-wing. It was true at one time, but according to Wikipedia they've shifted over the last decade from being right-wing towards the center:

 "Under the leadership of Jyrki Katainen, chairman from 2004 to 2014, the National Coalition Party shifted from a socially conservative, neoliberal party of the upper class towards a socially liberal, centre-right catch-all party.[8][9] It is now moderately liberal and reformist,[10] and supports, among other things, multiculturalism[11] and same sex marriage.[12"

<TEXT> "I'm far far less likely to be a victim of rape"

Yet far, far more likely to be a victim of violence overall and far more likely to be murdered - not sure why you have to just single out one particular type of serious and ignore everything else (including more serious crimes)

and I will, on average, earn more throughout my life

On the condition that you work longer hours, commute much further, work harder, work at night, in more dangerous and less popular fields. 97% of the victims of workplace deaths are male.

<TEXT> Big increases in male unemployment in the early 80s, particularly in that area, and then a real struggle for middle-aged men to them find an alternative career. I'd guess most men don't kill themselves when losing their job, only doing so after years and years of unemployment/rejection and finally realising they're not really wanted or valued by society any more. Therefore, we'd see a big delay between the actual job losses and the suicides later resulting from them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In any case, what I was talking about was the increase in suicides in recent years - to which societal attitudes to men in the above cases haven't changed (that I've noticed) 

That's absolutely correct. However, there are far more divorces than 20 years ago, unfair divorce settlements are more common and the male prison population is at/near a record high too.

So, although the average man facing these problems probably has it only slightly worse than in the past, what compounds the problem there are simply far more men in these desperate and unfair situations, thus more suicides.

As for your points about the availability of government funding, that's total nonsense. The government spends hundreds of millions of pounds helping victims of abuse, it's just that almost none of it goes to the 40% of victims that are male.

I managed to number crunch the figures for spending on Scotland a few years back and break it down by gender. Basically, for every 3,500 spent on female victims of domestic abuse they spent 1 helping males.

I also detest your "prior caregiving" caveat above. Men should get to see their kids regardless of what happened in the past. If they're incapable of caregiving then fair enough, forget it, but otherwise they should have have as much of a chance of a relationship with the kids as the mother. Why should men who are/were primary breadwinners be punished for working so hard in the past and essentially become slaves forced into working for someone they no longer love? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard this argument a lot and I'm somewhat sceptical about it. It probably causes a small number of suicides but the fact is that a lot of these men really are in a terrible position, and it's not mental health services that will fix this, they're just papering over the cracks of the real problems the men face.

We see a lot of suicidal fathers who've been denied access to their kids for no good reason for years. Others also lose their homes in outrageous divorce settlements and in fact losing the house often goes hand in hand with losing the right/ability to see their children.

There are also a great many men suffering domestic abuse and trapped in abusive relationships (often just to protect the kids), and the amount of support for such men is beyond scandalous and they're still often barely recognised at all.

Add in other wider issues such as unemployment not to mention a justice system that blatantly discriminates on the grounds of gender and it's obvious that many of these men really do want to kill themselves, understandably so if they've lost everything, and have nothing left to live for.

To stop so many men committing suicide we need things such as introducing shared parenting, support for male victims of abuse, not to mention a gender-blind justice system. Poor mental health and depression in many men is merely a symptom of the problems men face in our society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should also add how offensive it is to label this book as garbage. It's widely accepted as the best book on this issue, documenting the horrific persecution of innocent young men by corrupt prosecutors and racist/sexist academics.

In addition to the false allegations, the men faced violence, harassment, mobs surrounding their houses calling for their castration and corrupt teachers artificially lowering their grades so they failed classes. The men were of course totally innocent, and a court went as far as declaring as such - a highly unusual outcome.

The vile false accuer in the case who all these "academics" supported wholeheartedly suffered no consequences as a result of her actions. As a result she was free to continue her life on exactly  the same path, resulting in her murdering her boyfriend.

I really suggest you read the book, i's such an important work about a hugely important case. </TEXT>

 Student Chris Warwick, 32, of Goldenhill, Stoke-on-Trent, said: If women have a network or society, and so do the LGBT+ community, it is only fair a Mens Rights Society should be allowed.

 And yet the mere mention of the creation of one brings about discussion into whether it should be allowed!

 The Womans Network allegedly finds the creation of the society dangerous. Anyone supporting true equality between sexes wouldnt find this dangerous at all, and so one has to come to the conclusion are they really supporting gender equality? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The procedures performed in female genital mutilation - even class 4 - have no medical benefits whatsoever. None.

Well for one thing the tissue cannot become cancerous if it is removed so there's a "benefit" (if we hacked off the breast tissue from girls in the same we we butcher boys penises we'd almost completely eliminate breast cancer too).

Anyway, multiple academic studies show a reduction in HIV infections for women who've undergone FGM, so you're talking complete nonsense. Here's two, both from different countries:

http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113 context=iph_theses

Well some forms of FGM do clearly cause significantly more harm than MGM so it's not exactly fair to say all cases are equally bad. On the other hand, less severe forms of FGM are actually less harmful than MGM. Therefore FGM is both more and less harmful than MGM, it all depend on which particular type we're talking about. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I feel the need to point out that female genial mutilation is in no way, shape or form equivalent to male circumcision in a medical or anatomical way.

Utter nonsense. It's true that the most extreme forms of FGM are significantly more harmful than MGM, but on the other hand, many forms of FGM are entirely comparable with MGM as are all the supposed "benefits". In fact women produce far more smegma than men (10 times more) so in many ways it's 10 times more beneficial (assuming butchering kids genitals is your thing).

Here's the recent comments by a senior UK judge noting that MGM can be more harmful than FGM:

The stats for the London police fitness tests were recently released. obviously the standards are  low, but only 1.2% of male officers failed and so it shows that they at least somewhat fit for duty. On the other hand, 8% of female officers failed the test, a quite extraordinary difference. </TEXT>

Furthermore, if these women barely pass the much lower standards when they're new recruits, the just image how useless they're going to be when fat and out of shape. An overweight but quite muscular and tall man is going to be a lot more use in detaining criminals than an equally out of shape female half his size. </TEXT>

It would be interesting to establish exactly when she first spoke out against the blatant and industrial scale of rape, abuse and exploitation of children. The fact she was also working with children also would increase my expectation of her making such a statement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't have to be an MP to speak out against something and as a labour Party member not to mention a citizen of that area she'd be well placed to raise the issue with the previous MP.

I'd say even wanting something done 10 years ago might even be downplaying things. In neighbouring parts of the country these gangs were public knowledge more than 10 years ago, so she could have done anything at any time during more than a whole decade, instead she focuses on irrelevant distractions such as Palestine, even on the day the most damming report was published. </TEXT>

The bumbling idiot male concept is fine for occasional use and can be extremely funny not to mention harmless.

The real problem arises when the concept becomes almost the norm and /or when it is accompanied by some sort of equally inaccurate genius / superhero mother which just compounds the problem.

If a company has a history of misandry or producing feminist propaganda then go ahead and boycott such a film. On the other hand, if they don't have a reputation for pushing this kind of bullshit then give them a break and focus on more important issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He makes a great point about how they're empty threats in many cases and that men should sleep in their own beds. I enjoy his material and think he's an extremely funny guy.

However, he does gloss over the plight of the hundreds of thousands of men trapped in abusive relationships. Perhaps their wives can't dominate them physically in a fair 50-50 fight, but there's plenty of knives in the kitchen, not to mention the huge advantage of the surprise attacks. He also ignores that act that the man is not allowed to fight back or defend himself, so there is real danger for many men out there. Poisoning is also favoured by female abusers, which again has nothing to do with strength.

Of course if physical attacks fail then all that's required is a 30 second call to the police falsely alleging abuse and the man is in all sorts of trouble, and the sofa is a much nicer option than a police cell.

The best point to take from the video is that men should not tolerate minor abuses. Those men agreeing to sleep on the sofa are probably the ones who end up as victims of much more serious domestic abuse in future, so it's good to see people taking a stand and encouraging others to do so. </TEXT>

While I'm sure a few feminists have bought it, the number is clearly VERY small because none of the reviews mention anything about the content of the book.

<TEXT> Not nearly as funny as the huge boost they've given to sales. It was in the top 20 feminist theory books for quite a while following the campaign (and various other top 20s too).

The reasoning behind their spam crusade is pretty hilarious too. The following is the quote from Erin who led the campaign:

**"Lets Internet justice the guy who would like to legislate that less efforts be made to help girls into STEM careers."**

Think about that for a second, J4M B are simply suggesting the government doesn't give thousand of ponds of taxpayer money to women simply for going to university while the same money is denied to men. He's not introducing any evil legislation banning women in science, he just wants equality of opportunity, yet the feminists intentionally twist the truth.

The whole campaign is based on a lie, and that of course is typical of feminism. Perhaps an updated version of the book will outline this whole saga as yet another example of just how ugly (and stupid) feminism can be </TEXT>

Update, i just realised the forward is by Erin Pizzey, someone who's done far more for domestic violence victims than anyone else on the planet. So these feminists are attacking a book fully endorsed by someone who should be by far their biggest hero.

If feminists want to campaign against harmful media outlets then the worst women's gossip magazines are a million times more harmful than page 3 and much of the harmful material is outlined and advertised prominently on the front page. Page 3 is completely the wrong target, proving the campaign is misguided at best, or a stunt, or simply anti-sex prudish feminists attacking men and employment opportunities for attractive young women. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The same organisation that wrote this report is actually notorious for its discrimination against men. it not only bans them from many fund-raising events, it refuses to properly fund prostate cancer research.

Their reasoning for this is that prostate cancer research was neglected in the past and thus our understanding of it is still relatively poor because of this. Thanks to this discrimination of the past, there isn't likely to be a breakthrough any-time soon, so they're not going to fund current research at the same level as they do with many other cancers (such as female specific ones).

They're literally discriminating against prostate cancer patients today simply because they were discriminated against yesterday:

<TEXT> Well it wouldn't be a "top team", realistically I should think a really great women's player might manage in maybe the 4th or 5th tier. 
Obviously we'd never ever see any female defenders, goalkeepers, defensive midfielders etc, but a skilful play-maker might cope at a low level.

People do tend to under estimate the gulf between male and female athletes. For example Martina Navratalova is without doubt the greatest female tennis player of all time and she openly admitted that she could only beat men ranked 200th (or lower). </TEXT>

For example, her question contrasting the preference theory with the J4M B shared parenting one was almost worth asking and there was slightly more intelligence in her through process there than your typical feminist.

Many of the articles or discussion about J4M B are basically pure abuse, derailing or complete lies about the manifesto. She at least did none of these very much other than at the very beginning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-reliefl

Two weeks ago, in these pages, Rod Liddle memorably attacked what he called the fascistic smugfest of Red Nose Day, deploring the way in which we obediently shower money on charity just because were told to by people on the telly. Rods piece made me wonder where this 40 million actually goes. The answer, besides the charities mentioned above, seems to be a remarkable number of organisations advocating womens rights. There was the Womens Aid Foundation, which was given 112,447 for its campaign against domestic violence. Bassetlaw Womens Aid separately received 66,174 for the battered women of Bassetlaw. The Family Welfare Association received 114,501 for its domestic abuse service in Leicester  which, contrary to its name, doesnt offer a service beating up members of your family on your behalf, but helps the beaten-up. There was 43,000 for Womens Integrated Services, Harrow; 65,726 for the Migrant Womens Network; **and even 77,236 for Paws for Kids, which takes in animals when abused families enter refuges  in other words, it keeps battered womens bunnies in fresh carrots.**

 It is a similar story with the 60 per cent of Comic Relief funds which are spent in Africa. There was 797,310 which went to the African Womens Support Group, 500,000 to the International Community of Women Living with HIV/Aids, 120,000 which went to the Womens Development Agency in Ghana, 25,000 for the Inter-African Womens Development Organisation, and so it goes on. Even the neutrally named charities on Red Nose Days list turn out to be involved rather more heavily on the female side: Childhope UK, which received 857,314, turns out to be spending most of the money on the street girls of Bangladesh. If Red Nose Day can be summed up in one sentence, it is: shave your nipples and save a fallen woman.

I am sure many of these charities do a jolly good job, and I wouldnt wish to make light of domestic violence, but it does rather beg the question: **why do all these womens charities, which you never see rattling collecting tins or placing adverts in the national press, feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the pratfest that is Comic Relief rather than appealing directly to the public? Are they worried that if the British public realised where their money was going they would be less inclined to be so generous?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> The white Ribbon campaign sis actually far more discriminatory than even this guy suggests. Not only do they hate male victims, their only interest is the extremely narrow field of "men's violence against women".

Obviously that rules out male victims (both heterosexual and homosexual), but they're also marginalising any lesbian victims of dv, not to mention children. What makes this particularly bad is that many studies find lesbian relationships to be more violent than any other and we all know of the many children murdered by their mothers, fathers, step parents and mother's boyfriends. </TEXT>

Not only has UKIP enjoyed massive success, it has also forced issue to be debated and forced other parties to come up with competing policies in their areas of concern.

In even forcing a discussion of the harm caused by feminism J4M B is already achieving something that has largely been completely impossible in the mainstream media. </TEXT>

For the benefit of viewers from overseas, appearing on this programme is a big deal. It's probably the UK's most popular breakfast tv show and both the presenters are very high profile. **There will have been at least a million people watching.**

Update, done a little searching and seems he's also been on LBC (London's biggest radio station) and also Notts TV. I expect a BBC appearance is going to be pretty inevitable too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes it was pretty much impossible for a lot of young men to afford car insurance in the UK. The EU ruling means that's no longer the case. Insurance is still often very expensive for young and inexperienced drivers, but at least the additional huge surcharge for being male has gone). Our "equalities" minister opposes this change and wants to make driving for young men completely unaffordable again (which effectively forces quite a few to break the law by driving uninsured). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I generally regard the BBC as biased cowards, though to give them credit they did at least show the cover on Newsnight. I can only guess that these cartoons are slightly more palatable to the Guardian/BBC management due to the the fact that Charlie Hedbo is left-wing. Still, a much welcome move and nice to see these two to actually be acting in a commendable fashion on this topic for a change. However, there's still no image on the BBC website.

A quick Google search shows quite a few US outlets publishing the image, such as CBS, Yahoo, Business insider and ABC.

The Telegraph only has the text, which is better than nothing and certainly preferable to both the Mail and independent who have nothing whatsoever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The feminist behind the "Freedom Programme" is Pat Craven, she appears extensively in this clip I'd saved from 2009.

From the video description:

"A good deal of exposure - far too much - was given to Pat Craven of 'The Freedom Programme', whose contribution echoed her organisation's website http://freedomprogramme.co.uk in portraying a parallel universe in which victims can be assumed to be women, perpetrators can be assumed to be men. In common with many women running organisations focused on female victims of DV, she showed not an ounce of compassion for male victims, not recognition of female perpetrators. These women are so driven by visceral hatred towards men as a class that they can't even bring themselves to PRETEND to care about male victims.

Ray Barry is the leader of Real Fathers for Justice, and will be standing for J4MB in Broxtowe at the coming general election. His media performances are always impressive - whether on television or radio - and this is a particularly good example. His contributions start at 5:23 and 15:42. In the first contribution he presents data from the British Crime Survey, showing the consistent figure of 40% of victims of DV being men, which Pat Craven blithely says she doesn't agree with (!) then changes the subject by turning to Cristina Odone." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Firstly, he discounts the fact that some women aren't permitted to use mixed gender spaces due to religious and cultural restrictions

Those same restriction also apply to men of that religion though, and no religion has vastly more females than males.

 Secondly, he assumes that a gym membership fee somehow equates to a fixed number of hours of usage of the gym.

it's not hours of usage, it's about access. If the council were truly taking gender issues into consideration they'd see that men die earlier than women and thus exercise is crucial in combating this disparity. They'd also know that men work longer hours than women and commute longer distances and therefore have the most severe restrictions on when they are able to go to the gym. If the gym are then making this problem even worse for so many men, then it's discrimination twice over.

 If he's not going to sue for his right to use the kiddie pool 

Actually some pools have banned fathers with children from kiddie pools in the past but not mothers. I'd hope they get sued too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was banned for expressing concerns about his son's education. Schools are notoriously anti-male and it's noteworthy that they'd illegally ban him from the school rather than actually address his concerns. His concerns pertained to a child with a particular condition heavily associated with being male too, so that's a third possible level of relevancy.

Hard to tell exactly how much of an men's rights issue it really is without more detail though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good point, but you can still remain anonymous in the offline world to some extent, and it's often a good idea to guard your privacy anyhow.

Posters can be put up at night, PO boxes can be used and pen names or pseudonyms aren't going to casue any issues in most circumstances.

Alternatively, just ensure you are always recording your activities and then your safety will also be much increased. </TEXT>

Ultimately we need to be more focused on achieving more concrete goals and while I don't agree with all of his points there are some incredibly valuable tips there. Online activism is just as relevant as other types, but it's also true that it can at times be pointless - for example if hardly anyone is reading a blog or a post.

Our message and arguments are becoming much more widely understood and accepted online these days, so it's now more important than ever to move into more traditional mediums too. </TEXT>

Ultimately there isn't so much difference in swimming ability and the key issue is survival. Women have the advantage here, and it has nothing to do with being able to float. What kills people in the sea (particularly this time of year), is the cold. Women's extra body fat gives them quite a significant advantage. Some communities in Japan have use female divers for exactly this reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem to assume that all Labour critics are fans of the Tories and vice-versa. While I'd certainty vote for the later over the former, I still regard most of them as idiots, and I'm proud to say I've never voted for either in any election and never intend to do so in the future.

In most policy areas there really isn't much difference between Lab/Lib/Con. While the ideologies can be a little different, they all now tend to have very similar approaches to all the main issues, all favouring their friends in big business, surveillance, censorship, PFI, the EU, mass immigration etc. You write the above as if we'd expect the Tories to have a totally different approach to spending to Labour. If Labour outflanked the Tories with buying votes with unsustainable and unpaid for spending, then it's quite hard politically to oppose such madness. Anyhow, your thinking is the opposite of reality, and we should in fact expect any two (or three) parties that were so similar ins o many areas to have essentially the same/similar (stupid) spending plans.

Put simply, the fact that your opponent is equally as incompetent and stupid as yourself, is not defence for reckless actions, and the Tories certainly aren't really to blame for much as they didn't actually do the damage themselves (merely being guilty to failing to oppose Labour in doing said damage). Furthermore, the Tories wouldn't have quite the same access to the books as Labour, thus might not have quite have appreciated the scale of the problem quite as soon as Labour would be able to.

Your last paragraph is also nonsense. For example there was at least 1 Lib Demo who predicted the crash and called out labour on it. I'm not sure what UKIP's position was but I'm sure they wouldn't have supported much of anything labour did so they probably hold the high ground too or at least don't deserve condemnation. The same probably goes for the Greens, and probably also any old-school genuine Conservatives. </TEXT>

Even the interest we're now paying on all the debts is now enormous and it's not as if we've been left with much to show for it either and despite the recent cuts, they've barely made a dent into the problem.

Furthermore, wrecking the country is also about far more than mere money and economics, and Labour are guilty of wrecking multiple aspects of our society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some good points so far, although more suggestions for actual policy ideas or just subtle tweaks would be useful too.

I think a few people slightly misunderstand where J4M B are coming from here. From the look of things, they're not in the business of biting their tongue and glossing over uncomfortable issues. They're certainly getting noticed and the manifesto is quite impressive in its use of sources and academic studies to make a case.

I think the sort of feedback they're looking for more than anything is in relation to actual science/statistics, not to mention people suggesting solutions to issues. Therefore if you do have comments it would be wise to back them up with sources/stats, otherwise I doubt you'll change anything.

J4M B do seem fairly radical in their positions and I don't see any problem with that - for the most part that's entirely necessary at present (for example , the moderate fathers groups achieved almost thing for some 30 years until Father4Jsutice put father's rights on the map). What J4M B do need to ensure is that every single argument they make is  intellectually bomb-proof, every proposal is entirely feasible, and that the document si completely consistent and considers any possible drawbacks of the proposals. </TEXT>

Would have much of a problem with that and i think you've inadvertently identified the real issue here. If anyone brings up FGM in a discussion about MGM the almost unanimous response is that its completely wrong, a violation of the children's rights, should be illegal and the perpetrators prosecuted to the full extent of the law, just as with MGM.

Now if feminists could actually bring themselves to say the same thing about MGM and if they were to be as inclusive as us, then there wouldn't be so many MGM comments because their sexism and incredible double standards wouldn't have to be challenged.

<TEXT> I'd also love to hear the reply and appreciate you taking the time to challenge this. However, I certainly don't share your optimism about it being fixed.

The Greens started out as a somewhat idealistic but ultimately quite likeable party years ago. However, over the years they've gradually been infiltrated by groups for whom environmental concerns were secondary a best. These groups use the "green" label as a way of hiding or rebranding less palette able agendas such as communism and extremist feminism.

Unpleasant and idiotic feminist ideas are today deeply ingrained in the Green Party and the problem goes right to the top, with Lucas previously making a number of sexist statements and more recently carrying out ridiculous page 3 censorship stunts. I've challenged Lucas on her sexism several times in the past on her website, not only were my comments ignored they were also then censored too.

At the very least I don't see any chance if this policy being sorted out while Lucas remains in charge, though I'd live to be proved wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I see a lot wrong with sentencing men and women differently

Without wanting to defend the Green party's blatant sexism, your sentence describes something that already occurs a lot of the time. Unlike feminist myths such as the "pay gap", the justice gap is a genuine phenomenon, and men receive significantly longer sentences than women for commuting exactly the same crimes. The entire justice system blatantly favours women at every single stage, not just sentencing, but in terms of the likelihood of being charged or even arrested for the crime, with district violence being a particularly notable example of this.

A couple of years back MP Philip Davies gave perhaps his best ever speech in parliament, completely all the myths about the justice system trying women badly and proving that the reality was the complete opposite of what many feminists were claiming. I strongly recommend people view or read his speech.

So, although the green party policy is sexist, disgusting and hateful, it is at least fairly honest, and arguably rather more so that the present situation. </TEXT>

I don't watch daytime tv but, can certainly recall this show as being fairly notorious for its misandry in the past (something that tends to be the case with countless other women' panel showss.

Anyway, the panel looked quite a bit different and somewhat younger than it used to be, so hopefully most of the worst offenders have lost their jobs and therefore the show isn't as much of a stain on tv broadcasting as it used to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If feminists think a lack of women in STEM fields cases discrimination with regards to healthcare then how the hell do they explain what's being going on with cancer research, treatment and care for the last 40 years?

Breast cancer has seen mass screening programmes, immense research efforts and patients getting by far the best care of any cancer patients.

Prostate cancer on the other hand has been severely neglected, virtually ignored at times and although things are slowly improving, these issues still persist to some extent even today. Arguments against funding prostate cancer research these days use the fact that the understanding of the disease is someway behind other cancers such as breast cancer. One of the main reasons such understanding is poor is because of the vast neglect seen in past years. Therefore cancer researchers are neglecting prostate cancer patients today, simply because they were also neglected previously!

If money had been spent sensibly and targeted at saving the most lives possible, then some of the billions we've spent on breast cancer would have gone elsewhere and more lives would have been saved.

We're not talking about a trivial points here either. Prostate cancer deaths are set to overtake those from breast cancer in the near future. The numbers involved and the disparities in funding mean we're talking about discrimination against men on an absolutely vast scale. </TEXT>

Vera Baird is a notorious radical feminist politician who was previously the MP in that area. She got kicked out by voters at the last election but she then stood for the role as police and crime commissioner, an election in which hardly anyone voted. She,s heavily involved in various awful feminist organisations and seems to have spent most of her previous legal career representing women who murder their husbands or kids.

J4M B have complained previously about her awful domestic violence posters, and these rape ones aren't half as bad a those as far as I can remember. 

Anyway, the point is that there's an extremist feminist in charge of all policing in the region in question, so sexist poster campaigns are an inevitable consequence of this. </TEXT>

There are at least 3 hateful feminists who are of have been actually employed by Wikipedia and thus given the money of donors despite their awful and quite blatant sexism against men and male editors. These Wikipedia employees have been known to break some of the most fundamental Wikipedia rules including engaging in sockpuppetry and paid editing yet Wikipedia rules don't apply to them because it is so corrupt and feminist dominated.

Feminists actively stalk men's rights editors all over Wikipedia, often for many years, hounding and goading them trying to get them banned at each and every possible opportunity. This is usually for totally invented reasons or after being goaded by feminists for so long that they finally snap or make a minor error.

I don't suppose you'll be doing much about the above, if you decide to do so, as good a place as any to start is to look in the mirror. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the UK thousands of girls, usually from care homes, are raped by gangs of roughly this size and the police and politically correct Labour councils turn a blind eye 95% of the time because the perpetrators are Pakistani Muslims (and they even threaten to arrest the fathers of the girls).

Given that Birmingham is run by a Labour council and also has a large Pakistani Muslim population, then there's a 99% that this is exactly 
what's going on here.

Really, they should have just any of the men where a conviction was possible, but Birmingham is the worst council in the country when it comes to child protection, and combined with the refusal to prosecute Muslim paedophiles, the refusal to even gather evidence and then the difficulty of getting statements from the victim, then this isn't going to happen.

Although this looks like a men's rights issue not he surface, it really isn't, and is simply about past (and present) failing of ultra politically correct police and local councils who will only arrest sex offenders who are non-Muslim.

**update** article was significantly expanded a few minutes ago, confirming everything I suspected above.

Why the hell am I being downvoted, i just successfully predicted what was going on here? </TEXT>

No, absolutely not, we don't do that sort of thing here. If you still have that mindset then you've probably not quite got rid of all your feminist baggage yet.

Just because idiotic feminist men apologise for the actions of all men and blame them for the world's problems doesn't means women here have to be sexist and demean themselves in the same way. We want to challenge this kind of crap, not imitate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lynne Featherstone is  way up there with the most stupid feminists ever. From Wikipedia:

"In April 2006 one of Featherstone's researchers received a hoax email warning about an apparent date rape drug called Progesterex.[21] Featherstone submitted a question to a government minister inquiring as to "what assessment he has made of the use of progesterex in cases of date rape". Paul Goggins replied in the House of Commons that Progesterex did not exist: "It has been the subject of a hoax e-mail".[22][23] The hoax first originated in 1999.[24] Featherstone criticised the minister's response, stating "they need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out" and that "their cavalier attitude will not do".[25][26] However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone's conduct in "criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes", stating "trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn't help anybody".[27]"

"In September 2011 Featherstone caused controversy by claiming men make "terrible decisions" when they are in charge. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference Featherstone blamed men for the mess the world was in, and commentators drew parallels with similar comments by one of Featherstone's predecessors, Harriet Harman. Her comments attracted criticism from across the political spectrum and were considered particularly inappropriate given her role as a minister in charge of ending sexism. Conservative MP Priti Patel said: "These comments are really ill-thought out. As equalities minister she has got to be unbiased about the value that both men and women bring to decision-making."[39][40] Elizabeth Day of The Observer newspaper was equally troubled by the remarks, writing "the notion that women are not as aggressive as men, that we would all just sit around a table eating red velvet cupcakes and talking out the world's problems rather than firing off phallic-shaped nuclear weapons is a complete fallacy".[41]"

Finally there's this almost unbelievable quote about Female genital mutilation where she stated:

"if this had been little boys having all or part of their penis cut off the practise wouldnt have lasted four minutes let alone four thousand years!"
http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2014/03/fgm.htm

She's absolutely unbelievably stupid and misandrist and thankfully there's an extremely good chance of her losing her seat at the next election. </TEXT>

The point isn't to condemn all English teachers, most of us are simply discussing the possible correlation between being an English teacher and being a man-hating feminist.

<TEXT> Well the upper thigh is remarkably close to the circumcision wound and they say the infection may have spread to there.

Either way, when doctors are treating a seriously ill child it's going to be better for them not to have to be dealing with multiple infected parts of the body and completely unnecessary wounds. And it can't be much good for the immune system either to have to fight off infection at multiple sites.

This case is probably like quite a few others in that they can't really tell for sure if it's the circumcision that killed the child or not (though its the reverse to normal in that its usual to cover up the link between the death and the circumcision). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps that occurs a little too often on the site, although at the same time when there's proof of any of the above then surely it's only right to name names? There was absolutely no mention of the Guardian in the first version of the most recent story that was published. It was only later that we discovered that the Guardian appeared to have broken the story, had used the exact same dishonest phrase and therefore the BBC had simply copied it. Only then did we attack the Guardian for what they'd done.

The Guardian is the newspaper of choice at the BBC and they're notorious for having similar views and angles on a story. And we haven't attacked Guardian readers, only Guardian journalists. If anything we're  helping Guardian readers by ensuring they get honest and accurate headlines instead of sexist clickbait nonsense. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  his isn't anywhere.

Well her name is everywhere because of her parents coming forward. And yes his name is out there too, though I'm not sure when it was first published.

And if I'm assume she's mentally incapacitated and that no rape took place it doesn't mean I'm assuming she's guilty of perverting the course of justice. Perhaps she was so mentally disturbed that she genuinely and sincerely believed to have been raped when no such thing actually happened.

I think this is the crux of the matter. It seems one one really knows what happened in this case other than perhaps the accused, yet the police seem to be pressured into believing supposed victims and arresting accused rapists regardless of the evidence. Perhaps instead of this tendency to classify everything as either "rape" or occasionally "no crime" there should be quite a few more cases classified as "who the hell knows". </TEXT>

They supposedly had enough "evidence" to class it as a rape though at the same time they didn't actually have any evidence other than the word of a highly mentally disturbed individual. Seems like very poor conduct on the part of the police to me.

Perhaps if we actually treated innocent people who are merely accused of crimes rather better than all this might not have happened. At the very least we need to see anonymity for the accused. </TEXT>

There does appear to be clear police bias in classing this case as a rape, on top of the lack of evidence there's the clear unreliability of the witness. Perhaps both sides got it badly wrong and maybe if the police had classified it correctly in the first place and treated the man better than he might not had such a need to clear his name?

Furthermore, knowing how incompetent may police forces are, it's pretty common for them to fail to collect or take account of fairly basic evidence. Perhaps there wasn't sufficient evidence of any lies until the accused had paid out a shed load of money and had collected it all himself? </TEXT>

True, but your point means they're typically more prone to making false rape allegations too.

 I guess the guy who was originally accused of the rape wanted some sort of pay back after her story failed to materialise and hence took her to court.

"pay back" is a bit of a strange way of putting it. If a party has indeed  been subject to a false allegations then surely they just wants justice and to protect future victims from the perpetrator who had caused them so much harm and distress?

The fact that she was facing trial for false rape accusations points to there being strong evidence to this being the case, yes she's innocent until proven guilty, but that's where "alleged" comes in.

The BBC could easily use neutral terminology in which neither party is described as a victim/perpetrator, but the worst case scenario is to completely turn reality on its head and to so clearly state the accused is the "victim". Doing so in the headline is worse still - anyone just glancing at Reddit/Twitter and not clicking through the story is being severely misled by an organisation with a duty to be impartial and report the facts. The headline breaches countless BBC guidelines, and as for the report itself, where the quotes from someone with the point of view of welcoming prosecutions of false rape accusers and highlighting just how many people get away with such crimes? </TEXT>

 to:	 Dominic Casciani dominic.Casciani@bbc.co.uk
date:	 7 November 2014 16:58
subject:	 Ridiculously biased headline in your report on alleged false rape accuser

Dominic,

I'm extremely concerned about the blatant BBC bias in the article about the alleged false rape accuser who committed suicide. The report itself on the matter isn't exactly neutral though at least not terrible, but the headline is just shocking and turns reality on its head and is extremely offensive to victims of false rape accusations. The case is quite clearly not about an "alleged rape victim" and the neutral term that should be used is "alleged false rape accuser".

While it's true that some people alleged that a rape occurred (mainly the accuser herself), the crime she was facing trial for was for making false rape accusations The BBC is obliged to report matters impartially and neutrally, and it's obvious that the key alleged offence here is that of making false rape accusations as that's the only offence for which there's sufficient evidence for a prosecution. As the article itself admits, actual prosecutions are false rape allegation are very rare (though not necessarily false rape accusations themselves of course). The fact that the courts routinely fail to go after false rape accusers thus makes the case against the choice of headline even stronger still. It's also worth nothing that the actual success in gaining a conviction in false rape cases in the few cases that get to court is very high, again suggesting that prosecutors actually rarely go after the wrong person and tend to get these things right in the instances when they actually prosecute perpetrators of such heinous crimes . Furthermore, if the BBC were to stop covering up cases of alleged false accusations by pretending the alleged perpetrator was the victim, then perhaps we'd also see a few more of these false accusers facing justice?

I'm not sure if you're the one responsible for the ridiculously biased and offensive choice of headline but the article does carry your name, and due to the BBC's failure to be transparent and provide any other contact details for the material we at HEqual will have to assume your the one responsible for the content unless we hear otherwise. Therefore please ensure this offensive and dishonest headline is fixed ASAP or forward this information onto whoever is responsible for this blatant breach of BBC policy.

There is one possible alternative solution that could be used instead of changing the headline. If it stays in place, presumably we can also expect to all future BBC headlines concerning actual prosecutions for rape to instead refer to the perpetrators as "alleged victims of false rape allegations". To be honest i don't recommend this second course of action, but the choice is yours.

Regards

John Kimble

It's actually a very useful tool for cases where the police can't be bothered to get involved or perhaps where they might be better qualified person than the police to make the case. Animal welfare charities routinely use private prosecutions for example.

Also, it's notable that this case changed from a private prosecution to one by the state once the victim made it clear that he was determined to go through and that there was sufficient evidence to potentially secure a conviciton. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 50/50 doesn't have to be the norm. All the norm should be is that fathers play a meaningful role in their children's lives, and the courts and society accept this. Some fathers will have 50% custody, some 40% some even 60%.

There's no shame or loss of face in a hard working father, who perhaps has unsociable hours, having the kids for slightly less time than the mother, it's not a contest, that's the issue we're trying to get away from. When couples separate they should still work together and do their best for the kids.

There could even be an assumed 50/50 split but with one parent still being on friendly terms and offering to be a babysitter when the other is exceptionally busy (and grandparents/siblings from either side of the family can do the same, regardless of who's "turn" it supposedly is to have custody). It's all about moving away form this childish, combative way of doing things which involves expensive lawyers, and instead moving toward fairness and common sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some good points there, though you seem to be falling into the trap of assuming we want to force 50-50 parenting onto people.

You talk about "universal 50-50", as if we're feminists wanting for men to have 50% of everything, regardless of merit, desires or consequences ( like how feminist try to force women into politics or force companies to have huge female quotas on their boards)

Some men are perfectly comfortable just being part-time dads who see their kids at the weekend, and if that works for them, the mothers and particularly the kids then great. The men's movement simply wants equal parenting to be a genuine option and the default position in the absence of other evidence.

Kids should simply have the right to see both their parents and neither parent should be able to deny the other a meaningful relationship with their children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's not a huge amount of merit to the first link (though I seem to recall reading about "street harassment" at the time and it meets your requirement of featuring a female victim so you should like it). You're way off for the other two though.

We have charities such as the NSPCC basically campaigning against men and fathers, and all sorts of groups and politicians suggesting fathers are a danger to their own children and using fraudulent statements to make the "case" that we shouldn't have shared parenting. Therefore when women murder their own kids it's more than legitimate to post such news, more even more so when they do so using such horrible methods, and more so again when there's possible custody issues on the horizon.

As for the final link, I firmly stand by that too as it shows a child far exceeding the policing abilities of not one but two trained WPCs working together. It therefore makes a hugely compelling case against lowering standards in the police and thus effectively discriminating against the best candidates by failing to recognise and take advantage of their much needed and obvious abilities. Not only is this harmful to such candidates, the weakening of police and fire serves though such policies also puts the general public in danger (and members of the emergency services too). In summary, my concern is not so much with the incompetent police, but with the victims of their policing and with the unemployed/underemployed candidate who should have been employed in their place. </TEXT>

I've also answered your question about what would happen if the roles were reversed, can you maybe read my answer instead of taking us round in circles? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Would you have posted this article if the roles had be reversed?

Well if women made up 40% of domestic violence victims of a crime yet were denied assistance front he government/charities soley because of their gender then that would be a complete role reversal and I'm sure I'd post it.

As for your comments on Rotherham you're implying that I wouldn't have posted the story about those 1,400 victims and wouldn't have had the slightest interest if they'd simply been 4 years older whilst all the other facts remained the same. That is total nonsense though you do make an interesting point that it's men and children who tend to be failed by the government time after time rather than adult women. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A while back i did some number crunching for government spend on male victims of domestic violence over the previous decade or so. One finding for was that for every pound spent on male victims in Scotland there was 3,500 spent on female victims.

Not sure why this is being downvoted so here's the actual figures as of 2010:

100 million spent on female victims
28,000 spent on males

That's a 350,000% disparity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every post of mine about women? You mean such as the ones about female rape victims being ignored by the media?

I do happen to have a huge amount of concern about male victims of domestic violence given the way they are systematically denied help and support, though as highlighted above I generally have concern for anyone in society deliberately marginalised and denied assistance and justice by the state and by supposed charities.

There's numerous laws in this country that blatantly discriminate against men and I'm yet to find any that do the same to women, so yes men are usually the victims of the legal and justice system, even (or perhaps particularly) when it actually functions as designed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  a guy in the year above me at 20 dated a 14 year old for years

There isn't much "dating" going on in the cases with the grooming gangs, how many such cases later ended in the victim and groomer having a long lasting loving relationship and getting married? In fact if he dated a girl who was 14 for years, then she'd be over 16 by the end of it. Grooming gangs typically have no interest in any girl over 15.

The cases were purely about exploitation with the victim drugged or given alcohol, subject to threats and violence and forced into sex with multiple men, often 2,3 or 4 times her own age. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Rotherham the number of abortions resulting from these child rape cases far exceeded the number of convictions. The lack of evidence really isn't a problem a lot of the time, it's just that the police and authorities don't even try to collect it when its staring them in the face. They refused to fund DNA tests, even in cases where victims had insisted one be carried out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  its hard to be funny and authoritarian at the same time.

Neither left nor right wing politics have any connection with authoritarianism, so Lee's talking bollocks. The left's strict adherence to political correctness is about the most extreme and authoritarian trend we've seen in politics in recent years. Also, I wouldn't describe the Conservatives (and certainly not Cameron) as a good example of right wing, just part of the Lab/Lib/Con elite. UKIP are more right wing and their support is increasingly working class (particularly the downtrodden who've been failed and abandoned by the likes of Labour).

As for sexism, the real sexists are the BBC who've adopted blatantly sexist quotas instead of employing people based on merit therefore reducing the quality of broadcasts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Not sure your argument that UKIP are being treated differently holds much water..

Well there's a very obvious successor to Tonge doing the same sort of stuff yet they are always treated as isolated incidents rather than anything to do with the Lib Dems as a whole. If the media must label and smear UKIP as racists who hate immigrants then why don't the Lib Dems get the label of the anti-Semitic party? (especially considering that they largely stood by and kept such people in the part for as long as possible, incident after incident) And getting back to the main point of the discussion, why aren't comedians in particular doing this? </TEXT>

Worth nothing that it wasn't a one off and she had a history of making vile comments, including stating she'd probably become a Palestinian suicide bomber if she lived there.

Note that she still gets a nice taxpayer salary and retains political power via her seat in the Lords. I suppose in fairness to the Lib deems they did withdraw the whip, albeit after about her 10th offence (though I wonder if she still retiains party membership?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's largely been debunked, every party has its share of nutters at local level, just the media tends to focus on UKIP ones right now.

Labour has links to all sorts of terrorists and has covered up thousands of child rapes all because of their political agenda. The Lib Dems have anti semites who think we need investigation in Jews harvesting body parts in Haiti and other Lib Dems even blow stuff up. The Greens used to have somewhat sane politicians back in the day, but almost all seem completely loopy now (just look at the background of Beatrix Campbell for example).

the only difference i can see is that UKIP butters get exposed by the media and laughed at, whereas Green, Labour, Lib Dem and Tory ones get awards form the queen instead and/or shunted off the the House of Lords. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. It's not that they don't criticise Labour (albeit less strongly), it's the types of criticism and angle used that shows the true scale of the bias.

Some of the greatest sources of humour in terms of hypocrisy and generally being complete scum and/or totally idiots would be Diane Abbott, Mr and Mrs Harman, Denis MacShane all of Labour not to mention Mike Hancock and Lynne Featherstone of the Lib Dems (and their several anti-semitic politicians). The way the likes of Ed Balls and Angela Eagle constantly get everything wrong is absolute comedy gold, and to be honest a lot of high ranking Labour politicians make the idiot Tories look relatively intelligent.

I don't really watch the BBC much these days, but how many twitter porn gags have they done about the Harmans? Does anyone have a go at racist Diane Abbott other than Andrew Neil?

I recall a feature on the BBC website about various famous people who'd got caught wearing Nazi uniforms and inappropriate attire over the years. The article listed all sort of obscure figures yet failed to mention Ed Balls doing the same thing, and at the time he would have about been the most significant figure in the piece! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This whole report is a total sham. It's completely dishonest and unbeleivably sexist and has nothing to do with equality at all.

It gives a score in different areas, and generally where there is parity it correctly gives maximum points. However, should women have it far better in any particular area (such as usually occurs in education) then the country still gets maximum points for equality.

So a country with 100% women MPs, no men allowed in school and most of the male population slaughtered by the government will be the most "equal".

Things get more farcical still on the life expectancy measure, whereby you only get maximum "equality" score if women live 7 years longer than men! One of the reason the USA got a low score is because the gender life expectancy gap is "only" 3 years!

The whole thing is total bullshit.

<TEXT> I'm not against targeting Israel, it's just insane for hem to be taking sides so blatantly in that conflict, though it's something the BBC does repeatedly.

I acknowledge they do critique Labour, but it's clearly a token effort - i.e. just putting a bunch of subtitles onto one of his speeches. I'd expect such subtitles attacked his personality of something vague rather than the fact that he was part of the treasury when they completely wrecked the UK economy for generations to come and spent every penny we have. I've seen the pilots of this show before the BBC took it on and the bias there was even stronger. It's pretty obvious that those behind it have quite hard left views, and as with the majority of the BBC I'd guess they were either Labour Party members of at least Guardian-subscribing Labour voters.

I'm not against them having opinions, but if such opinions are so strong then it's not suitable to have the television licence funding political propaganda - it's a major breach of the BBC charter. If they want to produce a Guardian style politics comedy show then it needs to find a home on a different channel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The show is horrifically biased against any institution or political party that's not left wing.

Your typical episode will attack, the Conservatives, then perhaps their coalition partners (but only really for being friends with the Conservatives). they'll then attack UKIP, then the Conservatives again, then the Daily Mail, then a few big businesses and then Israel.

There will be a token gag at the expense of the Labour Party for "balance", though nine times out of ten it will be a half-assed attempt. </TEXT>
