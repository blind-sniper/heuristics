[A survey of all patients who underwent leukotomy in England and Wales from 1942 to 1954 (Tooth et al 1961) documented 10,365 single leukotomy operations. An additional 762 patients underwent more than one operation. A follow-up study covering 9,284 of the above mentioned patients showed that 41% had recovered or were greatly improved while 28% were minimally improved, 25% showed no change, 2% had become worse and 4% had died. Not surprisingly, patients with an affective disorder showed the best prognosis with 63% recovered compared to 30% among schizophrenic patients.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1949/moniz-article.html)

[Here's another study looking into the effectiveness of the frontal lobotomy.](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.98.4.524)
  
 Of sixteen agitated depressions twelve recovered sufficiently to live in their own homes, and continue to live at home in a relatively satisfactory degree of emotional adjustment. Of the five advanced schizophrenics two have made apparent recoveries. Two have improved to some degree and one, after making only slight improvement, succumbed to a virulent lobar pneumonia.
  
[And another.](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=320302)
  
The bimedial procedure gave the best results, in that 54% of these patients were working full time and productively five years after operation. The corresponding figures for the bilateral and unilateral groups were 33% and 29%. These results were striking, since these were all patients whose mental illness had been unremitting for at least 2 1/2 years before surgery and had been refractory to insulin coma, electric shock treatment, and intensive psychotherapy. </TEXT>

[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png) 
  
  
[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)
  

  
  
[And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)
 
The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

<TEXT> No it doesn't. Your link is not looking at cancer risk from smoking weed. 
  
Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  
-[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)
  

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

The standard P85D is really slow to 155mph to begin with anyways at 35.8sec. Some perspective is that a M5 gets to 150mph in under 20secs.

<TEXT> Electric vehicles already match and beat the performance of high-end gas-powered cars at a similar price point, and it's likely a matter of time before they are competitive with low end combustion-powered vehicles.

  
In a straight line up to about 115mph, after that anything high end exotic is going to leave a tesla in the dust. On a track Teslas are really slow compared to their rivals due to overheating of batteries. They are hardly true performance cars and are more akin to straight line muscle cars of the 70s. Maybe once they can make an electric car that can actually hold up to a base 911 around a track will they become an actual performance car.

<TEXT> So then it needn't be removed from Schedule 1
  
Ideally yes. Nabiximol which is currently making its way through FDA required clinical trails for treatment of pain in cancer patients though unfortunately their last trail produce weak results. Though they are also proceeding with getting it approved for treating spasticity in MS patients, which it has already in approved for in the UK, Canada, and parts of Europe. 
  
The big advantage of removing cannabis from schedule 1 status will that it will allow more ease in letting pharmaceutical companies research and derive products for treating a greater spectrum of disease and illness.

Monsanto said the process and the findings will be independent and will be transparent. But the company said it would be involved in providing information and data for the review.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.


[Cancer Incidence among Glyphosate-Exposed Pesticide Applicators in the Agricultural Health Study](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3435746?uid=2 uid=4 sid=21104202186197)
  
Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

Only worth .25 USD as currency, but invaluable when used as a pocket size tool.

Many products have large flat-head like fasteners designed to be turned by a United States Quarter Dollar. Most residents of the USA will already have one of these handy, so this offer is more for our international customers who may not have an appropriately sized coin available, or people crazy enough to pay $2.95 for a $0.25 coin... Of course, that means that for every purchase, $2.70 is helping iFixit continue providing great manuals and answers for millions of people!

Your coin may be any year, it may be new, it may be well used. We only guarantee it's in serviceable condition as a handy pocket size tool, and worth at least 0.25 USD. These quarters are from two sources: our founder's parking meter change stash (enabling him to support local government with parking fines), and from the pinball machine in the iFixit lobby that is set to "free play" but still manages to collect a few stray quarters.

<TEXT> Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  
-[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)
  

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

No he didn't, duration was way too long and sample size was way to small to be able to gain any meaningful data. Monsanto looked at sub chronic toxicity and Seralini just through shit at the wall and hoped something stuck. 
  
if he use wistar rats like many other carcinogenity studies amd presented tumors as evidence you might
  
Wistar and SD rats are both commonly used for testing either toxicity or carcinogencity. 
  
And he did in fact present his findings on tumor prevalence as evidence against both glyphosate and GMO feed [despite not running any statistical analysis](http://i.imgur.com/F3MtjXB.png), maybe you should actually read the paper?
  
Suffering inducing euthanasia and deaths corresponded mostly
in females to the development of large mammary tumors. These
appeared to be clearly related to the various treatments when
compared to the control groups. These tumors are generally known
to be mostly estrogen-dependent (Harvell et al., 2000). We observed
a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors by R
alone, a major formulated pesticide, even at the very lowest dose
administered
  
...
  
  
Interestingly, in the groups of animals fed with the NK603 without
R application, similar effects with respect to enhanced tumor
incidence and mortality rates were observed.

<TEXT> Tumor prevalence was a major finding of his study and any toxicologist worth his shit would be aware of the rate of spontaneous tumors in SD rats when taken out to 18+ months. Again, there is little reason anyone would run a rat study with SD rats out to 2 years unless you were looking for carcinogencity. Chronic toxicity is usually 1 year at 20 rats per sex per group (OECD 452). Seralini didn't not follow protocol for any international recognized toxicity study, his protocol and how he reported his findings most matched a carcinogencity trial. 
  
The only person misinformed is you and your pestering that Seralini's study actually means anything in terms of GMO safety. There is a reason why the study was retracted and many health and safety boards published their own independent reviews citing faults and errors in it.

[Here is the original 2012 research paper by Seralini](http://www.gmoseralini.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GES-final-study-19.9.121.pdf)



[Here is Elsevier retracting the study from the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology.](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology) 
  
The retraction was over the fact that do to the small sample size of 10 rats per sex per group and 2 year duration of the study it was physically unable to draw meaning conclusion on either general toxicology or carcinogenicity. 
  
[The common protocol for sub chronic toxicity dictates 10 rats per sex per group for 13 weeks.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-408-repeated-dose-90-day-oral-toxicity-study-in-rodents_9789264070707-en)
  
[The common protocol for chronic toxicity dictates 20 rats per sex per group and is ran for one year.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-452-chronic-toxicity-studies_9789264071209-en)
  
[The common protocol for carcinogenicity is 50+ rats per sex per group for 18-24 months.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-451-carcinogenicity-studies_9789264071186-en)
 

[Here is a study that modeled the effect on decreasing sample size of a carcinogenicity study](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~hahn/psfile/papyang.pdf)
  
[Relevant section showing the decrease in power from 50 rats per group down to 30.](http://i.imgur.com/MEhC8C8.png) This is in contrast to the 10 rats per group that Seralini decided to use for his study.


Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction was in line with COPE guidelines.  
  
  
[The COPE guidelines were consulted when making this decision. According to the COPE guidelines, Journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error).(COPE, 2009). The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Sralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)
  
Here are some responses to the original 2012 Seralini study, finding short comings in both design and statistical methods used.  
  
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007843

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007892
  
[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research. 
From ANSES opinion from their evaluation of the Seralini study on pathologies.](http://i.imgur.com/W0OJGIg.png)
  
[Here is the relevant chart.](http://i.imgur.com/BxD7sAb.png)  


[Monsanto's response to the study](http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/ProductSafety/seralini-sept-2012-monsanto-comments.pdf)  
  
  

[Here is a Nature article on the controversy.](http://www.nature.com/news/hyped-gm-maize-study-faces-growing-scrutiny-1.11566)
  
Also this was not the first long term GMO feeding study.  
  
[Sakamoto's 104 week feeding study was, it looked at GMO soybeans and failed to find harm interms of carcinogenicity in Wisker rats.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787312)
  
[Also here is some info on who funded CRIIGEN to do this study.](http://gmopundit.blogspot.com/2012/09/auchan-and-carrefour-financed-criigen.html)



 
The study was recently republished in a relatively new journal with minor changes to wording and can be found [here.](http://www.enveurope.com/content/26/1/14)
  
[Here is the response by several scientist of the republishing of this study.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/06/24/scientists-react-to-republished-seralini-maize-rat-study/)

[Here is a Nature article on the republication of the Seralini et al study.](http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-re-published-1.15463)
  
I also like this quote I found by Tom Sanders who is a professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London.
  

Republishing data that was faulty in the first place in study design and analysis does not provide redemption. Furthermore, it is now possible to publish almost anything in open access journals 
  
[Also the republication was not peer reviewed.](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/26/republished-seralini-gmo-rat-study-was-not-peer-reviewed-says-editor/)
  
Here is a quote of Seralini admitting that the goal of the study was to ban GMOs.
  
["What we want to achieve with this study is a moratorium"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd0RugGjAg amp;t=10m45s)
  
**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions he makes. </TEXT>

Again, the major presented findings of Seralini's research were the tumors and the only reason why you would run a 2 year study on SD rats would be to test for carcinogencity.  </TEXT>

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

<TEXT> Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  
-[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)
  

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

<TEXT> Dr. Perlak I first want to thank you for doing this AMA as I believe a lot of the concerns/fears of GMO is one rooted in a lack of dialogue between the public and the scientist behind this technology.
  
My first question is back in 1999 there was [this](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB919722577962514000) article in the WSJ about how Monsanto has a buddy system in which they pair up a scientist with someone from marketing/finance. Amsuingly you are mentioned in the 1999 WSJ article. My question is, does the buddy system still exist at Monsanto, and what is/was your opinion on the system?
  
Second question/s are on behalf of /u/MennoniteDan who unfortunely can't post himself due to doing some actual farm work.
  
A)Can you explain the process of discovery, and implementation, of the genetics behind the new Xtend series soybeans?"

B)"What changes in formulation has Monsanto (and BASF) made to the dicamba in Roundup Xtend, in order to lessen the chance of volatilization? I farm near crops that are very sensitive to dicamba (cucumbers, peppers, peas, tobacco and ginseng) ."
  
Edit: One last question.
  
Do you think that the current regulatory environment and public opinion on genetic engineering has negatively impacted research into genetically engineered crops? And if so what do you believe would be a good way to address this issue?

<TEXT> [Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png) 
  
  
[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)
  

  
  
[And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)
 
The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

That's not really a fair comparison, you should look at similarly optioned cars. In the case of base models the 5 series is only 50k vs the 7 series 74k.
  
Most luxury cars that IIHS are in the 45-52k range with the sole exception being the new Maserati. 
  
IIHS have said they do not plan to test the Model S at all. wonder why.

Just to clarify IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from glyphosate exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence. A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion people or 1:10 people and they can be classified under the same group.
  
The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment which conducted a risk assessment on behalf of the EU found glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic and they recently made a statement in [response to the IARCs finding.](http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/349/does-glyphosate-cause-cancer.pdf)
  
The new IARC classification for glyphosate as a carcinogenic substance is based firstly on
limited evidence in humans. This risk is derived from three epidemiological studies in the
USA, Canada and Sweden based on a statistical correlation between exposure to glyphosate
and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, this assessment was not confirmed
in a very large cohort of the also cited "Agricultural Health Study" or in other studies. A
recent publication from 2012 has reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether
exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans and the relevant
methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. The review found non-consistent
patterns of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer or any
site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate. The current report of BfR to the EU based
on the evaluation of over 30 epidemiological studies came to the overall assessment that
there is no validated or significant relationship between exposure to glyphosate and an increased
risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of cancer. 
  

  
[Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of the herbicide glyphosate, drawing on tumor incidence data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent studies](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)

The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

When you look at human and animal studies the risk of glyphosate is overblown even among high risk groups such as applicators.

No one is claiming it's safe for human consumption, what is claimed is that it is safe when used as directed. [In terms of herbicides glyphosate is one of the least harmful ones to non-target organisms and soil health.](http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/pdfs/factsheets/soc/tech/glyphosa.pdf)

so why does Monsanto keep pushing it here? Other countries that DO need it aren't getting enough of it.
  
There has been a push for GMOs in many countries from India to the Philippines and in all instances it has shown to be a plus to local farmers from increase yields to decrease pesticide exposure. The issue is that GMOs have unfortunately become a political talking point and many countries that could gain from their use have decided to ban and halt their use.

<TEXT> Or maybe they will use a pesticide that costs a little more with just as much saftey testing but has less damaging effect on the environment and doesn't give their customers cancer.
  
What one? And there is little evidence that glyphosate is actually causing cancer in humans.
  
  
 IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from glyphosate exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence. A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion people or 1:10 people and they can be classified under the same group.
  
When you look at human and animal studies the risk of glyphosate is overblown even among high risk groups such as applicators.
  
[Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of the herbicide glyphosate, drawing on tumor incidence data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent studies](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)
  
There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

<TEXT> Here are some analysis of the 2012 study and its short falls.
  
[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

[Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council report](http://www.bio-council.be/docs/BAC_2012_0898_CONSOLIDE.pdf)  
  
  
Here is a great quote on their opinion on Seralini 2012  
  
It should never have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The process of peer review which is usual before acceptance for publication in scientific journals has clearly failed here.

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.


[Cancer Incidence among Glyphosate-Exposed Pesticide Applicators in the Agricultural Health Study](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3435746?uid=2 uid=4 sid=21104202186197)
  
Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma. 
  

[Multiple Myeloma and Glyphosate Use: A Re-Analysis of US Agricultural Health Study (AHS) Data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635915)
 
  
[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

<TEXT> You either have the creative urge or you don't. 
  
So it's the "urge" that make it art? So if Richard Prince had the "urge" to take comment and take photos off instagram then he's an artist right? Cause he had the "urger" right? So if someone who paints or takes photos purely to make money like a wedding photographer or a portrait painter then cause they lack the "urger" they are not true artist?  
  
So to reiterate, this crappy excuse of art is just some guy downloading other people's work, making insignificant changes that change absolutely nothing about the main focus of the piece
  
Why are they insignificant changes and how is the main focus unchanged?
  
nor that he only just doesn't violate copyright
  
Is he actually violating copyright? How is this work not protected under fair use as appropriation art? 
  
That'd be like me taking a photo of the Mona Lisa and putting a caption on it, and trying to act like I did something artistic.
  
Well by your reasoning if you had the "urge" wouldn't it be art? 
  
There's better "art" than this dude's in /r/photoshopbattles[1] .
  
Wait, is making art a competition? Is only good art "art"? What makes something good? And who decides this?  </TEXT>

[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png) 
  
  
[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)
  

  
  
[And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)
 
The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

How isn't what Richard Prince doing original? How many others have done this? And why is doing something original a prerequisite for it being art? Is painting a sunset or a bowl of fruit art? As neither is truly an original idea.

You're source has absolutely nothing to do with how Monsanto is bad for farmers. The article is about how Monsanto has really shitty PR, it's not about how Monsanto is a "terrible entity".
  
If you don't want to argue that's fine, but don't be surprised that when you post factually unsupported claims someone calls you out for it.

<TEXT>  From areas that we have data, GMOs have been beneficial to developing nations.
  

[From a study which analyzed available data form the Philippines.](http://i.imgur.com/KXcsl0T.png)
  
Form their conclusion.  
  
[Using farm-level survey data from the Philippines and quantile regression techniques that control for selection problems, we find that the effect Bt corn on yields is generally more strongly felt by producers at the lower end of the yield distribution. If we subscribe to the typical belief that lower-yielding producers are mostly poor smallholders (i.e., subsistence farmers), then the results from our analysis provides some evidence that Bt corn technology has benefited poor corn farmers in the Philippines through higher relative yield effects as compared to the more commercial producers at the upper end of the yield distribution. It is likely that the proportionately higher yield effect observed for poor smallholders is made possible by the damage abating property being embedded within the Bt technology. This suggests that Bt technology does not require substantial levels of technical skills and learning for it to be an effective insect control technology (i.e., as compared to, say, some Integrated Pest Management control practices that require season-long Farmer Field School training to effectively implement).](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919213001395)  
  
  
Also the net effect of Bt-cotton has mostly been favorable to farmers in India. . . 
 
 
  
The role of genetically modified (GM) crops for food security is the subject of public controversy. GM crops could contribute to food production increases and higher food availability. There may also be impacts on food quality and nutrient composition. Finally, growing GM crops may influence farmers income and thus their economic access to food. Smallholder farmers make up a large proportion of the undernourished people worldwide. Our study focuses on this latter aspect and provides the first ex post analysis of food security impacts of GM crops at the micro level. We use comprehensive panel data collected over several years from farm households in India, where insect-resistant GM cotton has been widely adopted. Controlling for other factors, the adoption of GM cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, resulting from increased family incomes. This technology has reduced food insecurity by 1520% among cotton-producing households. GM crops alone will not solve the hunger problem, but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy.

 Bt cotton has reduced pesticide applications by 50%, with the largest reductions of 70% occurring in the most toxic types of chemicals. Results of fixed-effects Poisson models confirm that Bt has notably reduced the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning among cotton growers. These effects have become more pronounced with increasing technology adoption rates. Bt cotton now helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning in India every year, which also entails sizeable health cost savings.

We address this shortcoming by
analyzing economic impacts and impact dynamics of Bt cotton in
India. Building on unique panel data collected between 2002 and
2008, and controlling for nonrandom selection bias in technology
adoption, we show that Bt has caused a 24% increase in cotton
yield per acre through reduced pest damage and a 50% gain in
cotton pro
fi
t among smallholders. These bene
fi
ts are stable; there
are even indications that they have increased over time. We
further show that Bt cotton adoption has raised consumption
expenditures, a common measure of household living standard, by
18% during the 2006

2008 period. We conclude that Bt cotton has
created large and sustainable bene
fi
ts, which contribute to posi-
tive economic and social development in India.

Accounting for possible selection bias, we show that the Bt pesticide reducing effect has been sustainable. In spite of an increase in pesticide sprays against secondary pests, total pesticide use has decreased significantly over time. Bt has also reduced pesticide applications by non-Bt farmers. These results mitigate the concern that Bt technology would soon become obsolete in small farmer environments. The survey data on actual pesticide use in farmers fields complement previous entomological research.

  There is a broad literature on the impact of Bt cotton adoption in different countries, but few studies have explicitly looked at environmental and health effects from an economic perspective. We analyse the impact of Bt cotton on environmental efficiency in Pakistan, using farm survey data and a doubly heteroskedastic stochastic production function framework. Negative environmental and health effects of chemical pesticide use are quantified with the environmental impact quotient. Bt-adopting farms have higher cotton yields, while using lower pesticide quantities and causing less environmental damage. Bt farms are both technically and environmentally more efficient than non-Bt farms. Bt adoption increases environmental efficiency by 37%. Achieving the same reduction in negative environmental and health impact without Bt would cost conventional cotton farmers US$ 54 per acre in terms of foregone yields and revenues (7% of total revenues). Extrapolating this shadow price of the technology's health and environmental benefits to the total Bt cotton area in Pakistan results in an aggregate value of US$ 370 million. These benefits are in addition to the profit gains for Bt-adopting farmers. Our results suggest that Bt technology can contribute to sustainable agricultural development.

<TEXT> You're wrong, Bowman wasn't in Food Inc. Percy Schmeiser was.
  
Though Schmeiser also wasn't sued over cross pollination. 
  
 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.

Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they only sue over willful and intentional isolation and growing without a licensee. Example being the case cited in Food Inc over Percy Scmeiser.
  
 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2.

The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year. 
  
  
There was also the more recent OSGATA V. Monsanto case, in which OSGATA sued Monsanto over aggressive/bullying practices, the judge throughout the case because OSGATA could not prove their claim in court. 
  
  From the Court Case.  
  

[Taken together, it is clear that these circumstances do not 
amount to a substantial controversy and that there has been no 
injury traceable to defendants. We therefore do not have subject 
matter jurisdiction over this action, and it is, accordingly, 
dismissed](http://www.osgata.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OSGATA-v-Monsanto-MTD-Decision.pdf)
  
Monsanto has actually sold these chemicals knowing that they are toxic both to humans, animals and the environment.
  
You're going to need a citation for this, but I believe you are talking about glyphosate/roundup which is generally safe and poses little harm to humans when properly used.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

Also the idea that Bt cotton has directly lead to an increase in suicides in India is mostly a myth.
  
[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png)

Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India. 
  
  
Also about suing farmers, Monsanto only sues over willful and intentional isolation of their license seed. They don't sue over accidental cross pollination. 
  
Also there is little evidence that Monsanto is aggressively going after farmers. Recently OSGATA a consortium of organic farmers attempted to preemptively sue Monsanto over aggressive actions, but the case failed due to lack of any evidence provided proving the claims against Monsanto were true. 
  
From the Court Case.  
  

[Taken together, it is clear that these circumstances do not 
amount to a substantial controversy and that there has been no 
injury traceable to defendants. We therefore do not have subject 
matter jurisdiction over this action, and it is, accordingly, 
dismissed](http://www.osgata.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OSGATA-v-Monsanto-MTD-Decision.pdf)

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

The overall trend is striking. From 1980 until 1987, opium production only gradually increased. However after the defeat of the Soviets, opium production skyrocketed. This alarming trend was affected by a drought that occurred between 1995 and 1998. After the drought during Taliban rule, opium production surged to over 4,000 MT in 2000 (Blanchard 2009, 4). In 2001, the Taliban, caving into international pressure declared opium production illegal (Blanchard 2009, 3). This campaign was very effective, and in 2001, only 200 MT of opium was produced. But, in 2002, when the new, weak Karzai regime took control over Afghanistan, opium production increased and reached record levels, with an unprecedented yield of 8,200 MT, or 193,000 hectares in 2007 (Blanchard 2009, 4). The rise in the opium economy has created many opportunities for insurgent groups, militia, and warlords to finance their operations against one another.

<TEXT> In this large prospective study, obesity was strongly associated with the risk of death in both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups and at all ages. After we accounted for potential bias owing to preexisting disease and residual confounding by smoking status by using midlife BMI values and restricting the analysis to participants who had never smoked, we found that even moderate elevations in BMI conferred an increased risk of death. The risk among participants who were overweight at the age of 50 years was 20 to 40 percent higher than that among participants who had a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9 at that age. The risk among obese subjects was two to at least three times that of participants with a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9. The risk of death among underweight participants was attenuated.

<TEXT> For the time being, but the fact that you are obese (BMI34) means you are at increase risk of chronic obesity related illness and disease. 
  
But over time, this group began to develop risk factors for chronic disease. After 10 years about 40 percent had become unhealthy obese, and by the 20-year mark 51 percent had fallen into the unhealthy category, the study found....This study suggests that obese people will eventually develop risk factors such as high blood sugar and bad cholesterol that lead to chronic illness and death, Bell and Freeman said.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

Well the traditional approach usually limits the amount you spray because it can in turn damage the plant. GMOs are resistant to the pesticides, so they spray a LOT of them.

<TEXT> Though when the authority figure made a direct order to proceed with the experiment 100% of the participants refused to carry on.
  
[Furthermore, close analysis of the experimental sessions shows that participants are attentive to the demands made on them by the Learner as well as the Experimenter [38]. They are torn between two voices confronting them with irreconcilable moral imperatives, and the fact that they have to choose between them is a source of considerable anguish. They sweat, they laugh, they try to talk and argue their way out of the situation. But the experimental set-up does not allow them to do so. Ultimately, they tend to go along with the Experimenter if he justifies their actions in terms of the scientific benefits of the study (as he does with the prod The experiment requires that you continue) [39]. But if he gives them a direct order (You have no other choice, you must go on) participants typically refuse. Once again, received wisdom proves questionable. The Milgram studies seem to be less about people blindly conforming to orders than about getting people to believe in the importance of what they are doing [40].](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001426)

Basically people went on with the experiment not because they were told to by an authority figure, but because they honestly believe what they were doing was overall a "good action".

<TEXT> You told me about Selini without talking about which specific points of his science were wrong. You let me know that he is not to be considered an authority based on his reputation, etc. But what parts of the paper are wrong?

  
The flaws of the study stem from improper study design and lack of proper statistical analysis. 
  
[Here is the original 2012 research paper by Seralini](http://www.gmoseralini.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GES-final-study-19.9.121.pdf)



[Here is Elsevier retracting the study from the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology.](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology) 
  
The retraction was over the fact that do to the small sample size of 10 rats per sex per group and 2 year duration of the study it was physically unable to draw meaning conclusion on either general toxicology or carcinogenicity. 
  
[The common protocol for sub chronic toxicity dictates 10 rats per sex per group for 13 weeks.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-408-repeated-dose-90-day-oral-toxicity-study-in-rodents_9789264070707-en)
  
[The common protocol for chronic toxicity dictates 20 rats per sex per group and is ran for one year.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-452-chronic-toxicity-studies_9789264071209-en)
  
[The common protocol for carcinogenicity is 50+ rats per sex per group for 18-24 months.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-451-carcinogenicity-studies_9789264071186-en)
 

[Here is a study that modeled the effect on decreasing sample size of a carcinogenicity study](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~hahn/psfile/papyang.pdf)
  
[Relevant section showing the decrease in power from 50 rats per group down to 30.](http://i.imgur.com/MEhC8C8.png) This is in contrast to the 10 rats per group that Seralini decided to use for his study.


Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant. 
  
[Here is a response to letters to the editors by Editor-in-Chief Wallace Hayes](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors)
  

The retraction was in line with COPE guidelines.  
  
  
[The COPE guidelines were consulted when making this decision. According to the COPE guidelines, Journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error).(COPE, 2009). The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Sralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)
  
Here are some responses to the original 2012 Seralini study, finding short comings in both design and statistical methods used.  
  
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007843  
  
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007909

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007892
  
[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn  


[Brazil National Biosafety Technical Commission](http://www.cibiogem.gob.mx/Sala-prensa/Documents/CTNBIO-Brasil-Seralini1725.pdf)  
  
  
  
[VIB response.](http://www.vib.be/en/news/Pages/VIB-concludes-that-Seralini-study-is-not-substantiated-.aspx)

[Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council report](http://www.bio-council.be/docs/BAC_2012_0898_CONSOLIDE.pdf)  
  
  
Here is a great quote on their opinion on Seralini 2012  
  
It should never have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The process of peer review which is usual before acceptance for publication in scientific journals has clearly failed here.

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research. 
From ANSES opinion from their evaluation of the Seralini study on pathologies.](http://i.imgur.com/W0OJGIg.png)
  
[Here is the relevant chart.](http://i.imgur.com/BxD7sAb.png)  


[Monsanto's response to the study](http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/ProductSafety/seralini-sept-2012-monsanto-comments.pdf)  
  
  

[Here is a Nature article on the controversy.](http://www.nature.com/news/hyped-gm-maize-study-faces-growing-scrutiny-1.11566)
  
Also this was not the first long term GMO feeding study.  
  
[Sakamoto's 104 week feeding study was, it looked at GMO soybeans and failed to find harm interms of carcinogenicity in Wisker rats.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787312)
  
[Also here is some info on who funded CRIIGEN to do this study.](http://gmopundit.blogspot.com/2012/09/auchan-and-carrefour-financed-criigen.html)



 
The study was recently republished in a relatively new journal with minor changes to wording and can be found [here.](http://www.enveurope.com/content/26/1/14)
  
[Here is the response by several scientist of the republishing of this study.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/06/24/scientists-react-to-republished-seralini-maize-rat-study/)

[Here is a Nature article on the republication of the Seralini et al study.](http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-re-published-1.15463)
  
I also like this quote I found by Tom Sanders who is a professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London.
  

Republishing data that was faulty in the first place in study design and analysis does not provide redemption. Furthermore, it is now possible to publish almost anything in open access journals 
  
[Also the republication was not peer reviewed.](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/26/republished-seralini-gmo-rat-study-was-not-peer-reviewed-says-editor/)
  
Here is a quote of Seralini admitting that the goal of the study was to ban GMOs.
  
["What we want to achieve with this study is a moratorium"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd0RugGjAg amp;t=10m45s)
  
**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions he makes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Almond trees are pollinated by honey bees which are a non-native and domesticated incest which are trucked in from across the country.](http://www.almonds.com/growers/pollination)
  
In total, we observed 2416 flower visits by honeybees Apis mellifera
(70% of all visits), 378 by wild bees of at least 19 species
(11% of all visits), 327 by hover flies (10% of all visits) and 314
by other insects of various taxa (9% of all visits). Other insects
included flies (primarily Bombyliidae and Muscidae), ants
(Formicidae) and other infrequent visitors (Table S1, Supporting
Information). The most flower visits by wild bees were provided
by the ground-nesting sand bee Andrena cerasifolii
(Cockerell) accounting for more than 2% of all flower visits.
Sweat bees also frequently visited flowers, especially an undescribed
Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) species and Lasioglossum incompletum
(Crawford). These wild bees were present only in
orchards with nearby natural habitat. The blue orchard bee
Osmia lignaria propinqua Cresson, a species that could be managed
for almond production in California (Bosch   Kemp
2002), was only observed once.

The retraction was over the fact that do to the small sample size of 10 rats per sex per group and 2 year duration of the study it was physically unable to draw meaning conclusion on either general toxicology or carcinogenicity. 
  
[The common protocol for sub chronic toxicity dictates 10 rats per sex per group for 13 weeks.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-408-repeated-dose-90-day-oral-toxicity-study-in-rodents_9789264070707-en)

[Here is a study that modeled the effect on decreasing sample size of a carcinogenicity study](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~hahn/psfile/papyang.pdf)
  
[Relevant section showing the decrease in power from 50 rats per group down to 30.](http://i.imgur.com/MEhC8C8.png) This is in contrast to the 10 rats per group that Seralini decided to use for his study.


Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction was in line with COPE guidelines.  
  
  
[The COPE guidelines were consulted when making this decision. According to the COPE guidelines, Journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error).(COPE, 2009). The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Sralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)
  
Here are some responses to the original 2012 Seralini study, finding short comings in both design and statistical methods used.  
  
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007843

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512007892
  
[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

[Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council report](http://www.bio-council.be/docs/BAC_2012_0898_CONSOLIDE.pdf)  
  
  
Here is a great quote on their opinion on Seralini 2012  
  
It should never have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The process of peer review which is usual before acceptance for publication in scientific journals has clearly failed here.

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research. 
From ANSES opinion from their evaluation of the Seralini study on pathologies.](http://i.imgur.com/W0OJGIg.png)
  
[Here is the relevant chart.](http://i.imgur.com/BxD7sAb.png)  


[Monsanto's response to the study](http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/ProductSafety/seralini-sept-2012-monsanto-comments.pdf)  
  
  

[Here is a Nature article on the controversy.](http://www.nature.com/news/hyped-gm-maize-study-faces-growing-scrutiny-1.11566)
  
Also this was not the first long term GMO feeding study.  
  
[Sakamoto's 104 week feeding study was, it looked at GMO soybeans and failed to find harm interms of carcinogenicity in Wisker rats.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787312)
  
[Also here is some info on who funded CRIIGEN to do this study.](http://gmopundit.blogspot.com/2012/09/auchan-and-carrefour-financed-criigen.html)



 
The study was recently republished in a relatively new journal with minor changes to wording and can be found [here.](http://www.enveurope.com/content/26/1/14)
  
[Here is the response by several scientist of the republishing of this study.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/06/24/scientists-react-to-republished-seralini-maize-rat-study/)

[Here is a Nature article on the republication of the Seralini et al study.](http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-re-published-1.15463)
  
I also like this quote I found by Tom Sanders who is a professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London.
  

Republishing data that was faulty in the first place in study design and analysis does not provide redemption. Furthermore, it is now possible to publish almost anything in open access journals 
  
[Also the republication was not peer reviewed.](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/26/republished-seralini-gmo-rat-study-was-not-peer-reviewed-says-editor/)
  
Here is a quote of Seralini admitting that the goal of the study was to ban GMOs.
  
["What we want to achieve with this study is a moratorium"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd0RugGjAg amp;t=10m45s)
  
**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions it makes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to Argentina's union of medical professionals, Fesprosa, glyphosate, not only causes cancer. It is also associated with increased spontaneous abortions, birth defects, skin diseases, and respiratory and neurological disease. 

  
Here are some studies and reviews on the safety and risk of glyphosate.
  



[Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715)
  
  
  
[Developmental and reproductive outcomes in humans and animals after glyphosate exposure: a critical analysis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202229)
  
[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and non-cancer health outcomes: a review.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798302)

[Review of genotoxicity studies of glyphosate and glyphosate-based formulations](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2013.770820#.)

  
  [Here's a safety analysis of glyphosate in many animal studies.](http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241665203_eng.pdf)
  
  


[Evaluation of carcinogenic potential of the herbicide glyphosate, drawing on tumor incidence data from fourteen chronic/carcinogenicity rodent studies](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)
  
There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.


[Cancer Incidence among Glyphosate-Exposed Pesticide Applicators in the Agricultural Health Study](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3435746?uid=2 uid=4 sid=21104202186197)
  
Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma. 
  

[Multiple Myeloma and Glyphosate Use: A Re-Analysis of US Agricultural Health Study (AHS) Data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635915)
 
  
[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.  

[Here is a good article that summarizes a lot of the data on glyphosate and cancer.](http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/2015/03/glyphosate-and-cancer-what-does-the-data-say/)

<TEXT> Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination of their crops. 
  
About the Schmeiser case.  

 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.  </TEXT>
