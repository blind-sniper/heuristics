<TEXT> Relevant Text: 

 "So as anyone who has watched the Vi champ spotlight may know, Vi was originally intended to be a top laner.

 She's got a lot of cool gameplay in top lane with the Q charge up and E cleave but, honestly, she's just too fair up there for too long compared to our current crop of top laners. In the early game she has meaningful mana costs, telegraphed attacks, and massive cooldown windows for her passive and all of her spells (P - 18, Q - 18, E - 14 per charge, R- 150). I actually think top lane Vi could be a pretty awesome experience for both sides of the lane if we did stuff like lower her CD's or buff E's range and mana cost but then jungle Vi would go to crazy town. Could nerf jungle Vi to compensate but then are we screwing over the many Vi mains who prefer her out-of-lane experience? It's a tough call. 
All this said, SmashGizmo got diamond last season almost exclusively with top lane Vi. He'd typically play conservative until 6 focusing only on CS and rush an Iceborn Gauntlet for the extended dueling power and mana to offset her high costs. Turns out if a Vi manages to stay even until 6 there is not a single character up there (not even Irelia or Jax) who can beat her in a straight up 1v1. Her burst and sustained damage output is insane when she gets the chance to use it and her late game with top lane items is monstrous for the enemy teams' squishies (or at least it was in season 3, a lot has changed since then)." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This might be off topic, but sometimes it is what someone doesn't say that hurts the most. For example, when someone that you care about a lot (and has told you that the feelings are mutual) hurts you in a way that you would not expect from them, a lot of times a simple recognition of the fact that they fucked up would be enough for closure. The lack of this can lead you to question everything leading up to this point, and whether they ever cared about to at all (or enough to avoid hurting your feelings). </TEXT>

Once I moved her mouse over to File - Print (effectively showing her how to print) she then proceeded to print out the same one page 40 times due to the fact that the kept hitting the paste button instead of print.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it boils down to the fact that whether or not it disappoints you, **there is** a lack of endgame content to keep some people playing. Now for some people, this is not a problem as they will make new characters and enjoy exploring the world. For others, who like to continue to progress their character after they hit the level cap (whether through new rewards or just more content) GW2 will likely grow stale for them shortly after reaching max level. 

Speaking for myself, I will most likely play a little PvP and WvW until I get bored and then stop. While GW2 doesn't have mechanics in the game that keep myself and many others coming back for more, I still had a lot of fun playing the game and think it was worth the $60 I spent. 

If I could pick one thing that ANet should do in order to retain players, I think it would be to release new content or update zones based on player level ranges in an attempt to keep things fresh for people who have finished the game. Maybe have a few NPCs that will dole out weekly quests that are basically events that continue to fill out the world, while not necessarily putting a carrot on a stick. I don't think it would be that much to ask to reskin a few baddies, and put together 3-quest dynamic event or something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel almost exactly the same. Sure there are some things I didn't like about the ending, but that is life. My big thing, which looks to be getting addressed, was the lack of closure. Add in some free DLC for someone who very much likes the multiplayer, and I give Bioware/EA a "thumbs up".

Keep in mind though, I still plan on thoroughly vetting Bioware's next release before I buy. No more preordering every game like I did with DA2 and ME3. To be honest, I still think Dragon Age 2 and EA "pimping out" the Bioware brand gets to me more than ME3 ever did.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I gave you an example in the post above of as to why, so I will not repeat it here. Also, while I agree that the ending was not good at all and has potentially cost Bioware/EA my business, I find it ironic that you describe my opinion on this matter as a difference in taste. One could argue that for every opinion that people have on the last 5% of Mass Effect 3. 

The harsh reality is that many (not all) people attempting to return Mass Effect 3 are scorned fans trying to get back at BioWare/EA any way they can, and looking for ways to make a quick $60 without justification. Much of the way people react to anything BioWare related now, and to other people who don't hold the same beleifs as this sub-reddit, reinforces this. Sadly though and also somewhat ironic, with business being a dog-eat-dog world, this is probably going produce a bigger impact than probably any other protesting method would. 

Also, let me just say that I support almost everything else being done to show BioWare/EA our displeasure, and a lot of what they do in the next few weeks will be the deciding factor in whether or not I will ever buy another game from them again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd probably toss the shit in the guys face, and then demand to speak to the manager. This would most likely result in me getting my money back, but it really doesn't have anything to do with what I mentioned above. A bad ending in a videogame is a lot different than a mouthful of shit. You don't see people returning DVDs for refunds because they didn't like the ending of Lost, or taking back books just because they didn't like the ending. 

Generalizations like this are garbage. It's one thing to be upset with a company like Bioware and speak with your wallet, and it's something entirely different when you try to weasel out of paying $60+ for a game you just played the entire way through. I for one, probably won't be buying another BioWare/EA product without first making sure via reviews and customer opinion that the game is actually good. They've lost my trust, and as a company they will have to earn it back. That is how spending money works.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion, creating brand new endings would be a disservice to everyone, especially the people that don't mind the current ending. I still think we should get more closure, and perhaps have some of the storylines that we followed throughout the series wrapped up, but completely re-writing the ending because a large portion of the gaming community doesn't agree with it isn't the answer. 

IMO, re-writing the endings would be the equivalent of taking a toy from one kid and giving it to the another that's crying because he doesn't have it (I am by no means saying that anyone is crying, just an analogy). I would rather see compromise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In all honesty, I think the endings themselves weren't bad at all. The main problem was the lack of content associated with each ending. I am just speaking for myself, but I would be happy if Bioware added about 10-15 minutes of extra, *unique*, content into each ending to allow for a little diversity between playthroughs and to close up to unfinished story beats. This in turn would give them the opportunity to add closure to a lot of the storylines (as well as Renegade/Paragon consequences) that have been progressing throughout the course of the series.  </TEXT>

Personally I think it is ridiculous that so many people allow their own personal beliefs to influence their decision making in regards to politics/policymaking. The fact that people like Rick Santorum can potentially become the President of the United States of America shows that we are still a long way away from achieving that kind of separation of not only church and state, but personal/moral beliefs and state.  </TEXT>

Never said you were. I said that you only think what you believe as correct and allow no room for anyone else's beliefs/opinions. Just because you choose not to believe in an idea that has no scientific backing to prove it does not make it ridiculous. That is what the main problem of this video is. Atheism is no longer just denying the existence of a supernatural creator, it's about throwing it in everyone else's face and telling them to "fuck off" if they don't agree.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> DAE Think That the Guns are Less Responsive in MW3? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-11-09 15:54:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I played MW2 a lot over the weekend in anticipation of MW3's release, and after hearing that MW3 multiplayer was basically MW2.5 I was pretty excited. However, as soon as I popped in MW3, the first thing I noticed is some of my favorite guns don't "feel" the same. The long range accuracy of the UMP45 isn't there anymore when you "feather" the trigger. The M16 isn't as accurate. MP5 still isn't back to its COD4 glory days. Overall, I think the guns have more kick, and have trouble staying on target like they did in previous games (MW2). I still love the game, and my KDR will probably increase after getting used to some of the subtle changes in the guns, but I was wondering if anyone else noticed some of these changes?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what needs to happen: Elementary school teachers need to be competent at math. They can't simply "love working with kids" and "enjoy telling stories and doing arts and crafts." You need to know your shit. You need to know everything about everything because little kids ask questions that are creative and insightful and completely off the wall. 

This. Yes, we need to pay teachers better. Yes, we need smaller classrooms. However, we also need to reform what it takes to become an educator, so we have teachers that are above average in all areas (i.e. reading, writing, match, science), as opposed to barely competent in any. There are a lot of great teachers out there. I was lucky to have a few that shaped my life forever. There are a lot of really bad teachers out there too, and we need to make it more difficult to become an educator to weed these people out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously there has been improvements, but overall it is more Battlefield. Mostly all new additions are welcome, even though some need more work. Graphically(XBOX 360), this game looks to be comparable to Modern Warfare 3. 

It's a good game, but too early to tell if it will be great(or surpass MW3 for that matter).  </TEXT>

The kingdom would not be in debt, no bastard children, the people would be well taken care of and justice would be handled properly. I also don't see treachery getting as close to Ned as it did Robert, as the latter made increasingly bad decisions over the course of years (as king, and with his wife) to end up in the situation that he was in.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Overall average for WI according to your link. In Ohio, starting wage is $33,671 and averages is $50,314. Regardless, I would have to agree that $38,284 is a very low average salary in WI.

A better quote is this:
"Prices go up on the tuition and then we give them grants and then they get out of the college and they owe $200,000. It makes no sense whatsoever. I don't think how anybody can justify it."  </TEXT>
