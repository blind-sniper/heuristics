<TEXT> Only if you've supped the Tory Koolaid - the claim relies on parsing the IMFs economic language carefully.

- China grew faster than the UK in 2014 but it remains classified as a 'developing' economy despite being four times larger than the UK economy. 7.4% growth.

- India also grew faster than the UK but, despite being a top 10 global economy, is not classified by the IMF as a 'major' economy. 5.4% growth.

- Productivity remains lower than 2007, unprecedented since the war.

- The growth we're seeing is mainly down to cheap labour driven by migration and stalled wage growth. 

- Unemployment is falling overall but the new jobs are at the very bottom end of the pay-scale. 

- US growth is forecast at 3.1% this year, and will certainly overtake the UK, just as it has in the past.

- Our [Real GDP growth](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last sort=desc) rate is 3.20 or 97th in the world. India and China are at 7.4, and we're being outpaced by Ecuador and Malaysia. 

- We are not even in the top [20 fastest growing economies](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/the-20-fastest-growing-economies-this-year) worldwide. We're being beaten by Poland!

- And we're not even the fastest growing G20 nation, but we are the fastest growing G7 nation for 2014 alone.

- Our [global competitiveness](http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015) ranking is woeful, we don't even make the innovation list.

So the claim relies on ignoring many countries that most would think of as developed and leaning on percentage growth rather than real GDP growth.

<TEXT> I doubt it. 

Osborne's policy, and the wider global Conservative movement's thinking, is to say that economic productivity is low because welfare-to-work programs and benefits are too generous. 

Essentially that workers are not properly motivated to work harder and get better paying jobs because they can get, in Conservative thinker's view, 'easy' money via welfare. To their minds this is why the recovery hasn't taken hold, treasury receipts are down and almost all new jobs being created are at the bottom end of the pay-scale - ergo this is why they were unable to meet their deficit reduction targets under the coalition.

The solution, in their view, is the removal of welfare-to-work policies and capping of benefits. This, they believe, will result in a more productive and motivated workforce. The result on the business end will be workers demanding and thereby receiving better paying jobs - which won't happen. Obviously they intend to remove the safety net without ensuring that business meets their pay objectives.

This same view is being expressed by Republicans in the US, Conservatives in Germany, and the UK - Osborne is blazing the trail.

But political parties main customers are businesses and the wealthy (also because ordinary people are not prepared to donate to them in large enough numbers for it to be meaningful) thus policy is again skewed in favor of big business not the worker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its about who the customer is, not the end user or worker. For example Train Operating Companies offer poor customer service to the end user because the main customer of the TOCs is the Government, not the traveller. They agree what service improvements will be made 10 years ahead and won't change that plan no matter how the traveller's needs alter over that decade because it's fixed in the franchise agreement, as are the costs.

Similarly with companies the 'customer' of most companies is their shareholders. In capitalist thinking this is fine because the shareholders should be the public which should provide them with the proper ethical and social motivations, but in the modern globalised economy most voting shareholders are institutional investors and other organisations whose single motive is return on investment and nothing else. There is no motivation to invest in the social fabric of the business or the social fabric of the country in which that business is based.

So we have a widening disconnect between shareholder value and social value. Companies will not pay people more because staff are basically disposable and the shareholders will not countenance any policy which reduces their ROI even if it results in better productivity and innovation in the long term.

Equally the customer of political parties is, again, businesses and wealthy people, and that again skews policy. </TEXT>

There doesn't appear to be anyone who offers Crohn's specific grants but there are many that do offer help for people on low incomes even if many have extraordinarily specific missions (such as helping only people with the surname Forsyth), there are many more like the [Talisman Trust](http://www.talismancharity.org/) and [Newby Trust](http://www.newby-trust.org.uk/) who do help people in poverty, illness, or low income circumsanaces.

PM me if you don't have food.

<TEXT> Read up about the [Burma Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Railway) as an example of what was going on.

[During](https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/prisoners-of-war-of-the-japanese-1939-1945) the World War 2, the Japanese Armed Forces captured nearly 140,000 Allied military personnel (Australia, Canada, Great Britain, India, Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United States) in the Southeast Asia and Pacific areas. They were forced to engage in the hard labour of constructing railways, roads, airfields, etc. to be used by the Japanese Armed Forces in the occupied areas. About 36,000 were transported to the Japanese Mainland to supplement the shortage of the work force, and compelled to work at the coal mines, mines, shipyards, munitions factories, etc. By the time the war was over, a total of more than 30,000 POWs had died from starvation, diseases, and mistreatment within and outside of the Japanese Mainland.

Which is not to say the UK is innocent, we also used 400,000 German POW's as [slave labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor_of_Germans_after_World_War_II#United_Kingdom) during and after the war. We didn't, however, starve them to death or beat them - not that this would justify the practice in any way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is that none of the companies I mention are actually 'cheating', thats a moralistic imperative implied by people who think that there is a fixed tax rate for everything that 'should' be paid, these companies are exploiting a loophole generated by a tax system designed for a less globalised world, and one that could easily be closed. 

The companies I mention are not cherry picked for impact, as you suggest, they are companies that either have the entirety of their tax base in the UK or have a trading entity with a tax base in the UK and retail products directly to the public rather than manufacturing goods.

Nintendo is not a direct-to-the-public-retailer, its a wholesaler, and save for its UK online store does not have its tax base in the UK, nor does it have an entity which does.

Reducing Corporation tax is the least helpful mechanism of supporting UK trading businesses as exists, as demonstrated by the government - when they want to provide subsidy to an industry they almost always do it through VAT - for example the print media receives 1.2 billion a year in zero rated VAT, similarly oil exploration to the tune of 400 million a year.

Even the 8% reduction in corporation tax made very little impact on my business or the size of its bill, but the flat rate VAT Businesses in my sector pay has a huge impact.

As I said, this move was PR. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They do - but you're not going to convince me that Starbucks, IKEA, the Daily Mail Group, Sky, Virgin, British Petroleum, Costa Coffee and Nero all have sufficiently low profit margins that they deserve to pay nothing or, proportionately, very little Corporation Tax compared to my business - in this way what Osborne has to say about CT is largely irrelevant to anyone with 1 million plus turnover (meaning they can afford good accountants).

How do you think small business owners feel when we struggle to pay the Corporation Tax bill whilst discovering that Starbucks paid nothing in CT because it structured its worldwide cost base to take a loss in the UK?

Merrill Lynch, for example, structured its cost base to take its entire global loss during the recession through its London office and will pay no tax here for decades as a result.

Essentially what you're engaging in here is pedantry. My complaint is perfectly understandable and valid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH the reduction in corporation tax is meaningful only to small businesses and even then experience suggests it won't do that much, but it sounds good when announced at the budget. 

HMRC often alter the soft rules around what CT applies to as a means of compensating for the headline rate reduction. For example they altered the rules for Directors Loans so they attract a higher rate of CT to compensate for the 8% reduction during the last parliament which resulted in my business paying 1,500 in retroactive taxation.  

Large businesses really only pay some corporation tax to look good, not because they have to. IKEA also has form on [this](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/21/multinational-firms-tax-ebay-ikea)

My little business with its 10k corporation tax bill often pays more than companies with massive turnovers.

Edit: CT is a tax on profitability and therefore there is a direct relationship to turnover, its also true that the higher your turnover the better accountancy advice you can afford. Whichever way you look at it structuring your global business to take costs in the UK that were incurred outside the UK in order to pay no, or very little tax here, is just wrong and an affront to business owners who do have to pay the full ride.

A 1% reduction in 2017 and a further 1% in 2020 is basically nothing but PR. </TEXT>

As one headline suggested this week the tragedy is Corbyn is by far the best leader of those on offer.

If the election showed anything its that the parliamentary party isn't reaching Labour members let alone the wider electorate - Harman's benefits statement and Chuka's response to Corbyn show that.

I'm actually wondering if a party split might be on the cards. Even if it is I'll still support Corbyn. </TEXT>

Secondly you're attempting to cast a moral case over a bill in the National Parliament by comparing it to a Scottish Parliament Issue - where is it written that Scottish MPs should agree with MSPs on all issues. Personally the issue is moot MP's are MP's.

Were the result run under List PR for example the result (Lab/Con/Lib) would have been 239/207/140 and all further permutations result in a wide enough majority for the bill to have passed because there would be a proportionate reduction in the votes against. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're discussing the election result, not intra party politics. Labour had a majority of 355 and this bill passed with 316 votes, 39 Labour MP's rebelling.

Firstly I really don't see how it's important that the bill passed with 'Scottish MP's' as there is no such thing as a 'Scottish MP' only an MP. Secondly how have you calculated that the bill passed with only Scottish votes, and what does that matter?

Had the election result been different the bill would have been approached differently, perhaps the whips would have made more effort to get people on board.

He would be left out of any mission which the UK government would not have sanctioned, this is the tradition in cooperating armed forces and has been for a very long time. 

The point actually is that Cameron could easily have asked that these pilots not be involved in certain missions, the fact that they were and he knew about it shows a complete disregard of the will of Parliament and is a very serious matter.

11,000 people decided the election.

By any measure this is the least representative election result the country has seen. Every system of PR shows a coalition or minority government.

<TEXT> Ok. Try reading this very slowly and outloud - perhaps then it will penetrate.

Not a single fucking point you've made is correct.

Both gas consumption and gas production are falling whilst renewable consumption and production are rising. This is a decadal trend, UK gas production has been falling since 2000. This shows you are wrong.

Your new claim *'My original point, that wind companies, which generate electricity, are not competing with the part of the oil industry which generates gas is accurate.'* is **obviously bollocks** - of course they are fucking competing you moron, they both sell their product to the god damned generation industry - it's the gas producer's main business for the love of god, thats why the production/consumption trends reflect each other. Jesus!

The first paragraph of the report I linked to says this:-

UK Government has implemented massive subsidies to promote exploration and development of risky and unconventional oil and gas
in recent years, including deep-water offshore resources and
shale gas. 

Who the fuck does oil exploration - fucking Santa? - Oil companies.

I've been replying because I've actually been trying to educate you on how this works - you've provided no evidence to back up a single thing you've said whilst vomiting a bunch of semantic crap to pretend you have point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly what is it you're trying to prove by differentiating Primary Energy production from energy consumption? No matter which set of figures you look at they both show that fossil fuel production is decreasing while renewables are increasing - neither supports your original point - in fact both sets of figures disprove it.

Oil and Gas industry receives *direct* subsidy for exploration totaling 400 million a year out of 1.2 billion. Whatever the hell you've made up above is just nonsense.

Really all of what you have to say has been crazed blustering to cover the fact that your original point was completely wrong in every respect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but the graph I linked to is the official DECC estimate for Primary Energy Consumption and shows the same trends as production. Once again you're wrong.

Frankly what you've written is so ridiculous I couldn't be bothered to go point by point. However, since you invite it.

You've claimed.

Wind turbines are not competing with massive gas extraction.

Well, they are, as I outlined above on the generation output side they comprise 15% of current generation and that output has risen 13TwH in just three years and renewables will overhaul gas generation output by 2018, gas output has been on the wane since 2000.

The British Geological Survey reports that we've got shale gas reserves in the UK which would put us somewhere between number 3 and number 1 in the world for gas reserves.

Again as I've shown the report claimed no such thing because as little as 10% of that is accessible and they lack confidence in their assessment of the upper number.

That would give us a roughly equal amount of recoverable gas to Iraq's proven reserves

Nowhere near, I mean not even close to that. We have the 24th largest proven reserves in the world Iraq has the 12th. 

You're conflating electricity generation and primary energy production

No I'm not.

firstly, we don't subsidise the oil industry in this country

Yes. [We do](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/74519000/jpg/_74519696_74519695.jpg). Around [1.2 billion a year in fact](http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9245.pdf) and that number is expanding. Actually its the same size as the subsidy received by the print media.

Primary energy production is not the same as electricity production.

Funny that it shows the same trends then.

I don't know why you think primary energy production backs up your case at all, what it actually [shows](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/437455/Energy_Trends_June_2015.pdf) is a continuing downward trend in the production of gas since 2000 and a continuing increase in renewables as I suggested.

the fact that you're conflating the two suggests to me that either you don't really have a firm grasp of what's being talked about, or that you want to intentionally mislead or misdirect people reading your posts in order to further an agenda

<TEXT> I'm really tired of people being complete dicks about this when discussing it online. Frankly fuck you - there is no need to be insulting.

The comment you've made above is simply garbage. Look at the estimated [primary energy production](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/71060000/jpg/_71060672_71060671.jpg), over the next few decades where is Gas? Declining to nothing. What is the major future source? Renewables.

As for these *potential* sources being anything close to middle eastern oil reserves you are simply crazy to think that or you didn't actually read the report you're quoting. The extraction costs are barely supported now let alone in the future given the unstable global market prices.

The BGS survey said:

"Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas and the gas resources are variable. It is possible that the shale gas resources in UK are very large. However, despite the size of the resource, the proportion that can be recovered is the critical factor."

Furthermore BGS's OWN estimate was 10% or 130 TCF which is fuck all and basically means it's barely worth the infrastructure spending and subsidy. The paragraph above also suggests they don't have high confidence in their estimate of total reserve which was 822 TCF.

The figure I quoted was Cuadrilla's own estimate which was higher (for PR reasons) than BGS's much more detailed study. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Renewables are competing, they're actually producing more electricity than most people realise, 28.1 TWh or 15% of total generation in 2014 - that's an increase of 13 TWh in just three years, if its allowed to carry on renewables will overtake gas generation output before 2020.

To set that in context Nuclear produces 20% of energy output, Gas 27% and Coal 36%.

Output from fracking is basically zero right now and Cuadrilla estimates it can only access 10-20% of the resource available in some of the fields. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FOM, and by extension the teams, has 5 sources of revenue. The race fees and the TV money represent 50% each of 1.4 billion of a total of 1.8 billion pre-tax revenue.

So, if you want online streaming you're not going to get it from FOM, you're going to get it from your national broadcaster because providing that would require the renegotiation of every TV rights contract in existence. 

A centralised streaming solution from FOM would also massively devalue the TV rights, meaning there would be little incentive to provide good programming around the races or pay for expert commentators. Furthermore such a devaluation of the TV rights would result in the teams earning less money each year because the streaming revenue would never match the kind of money broadcasters are willing to pay to repackage the product. </TEXT>

These are not teams struggling with poor facilities and scratching around for two brass farthings to pay the fuel bill.

The lowest paid team on the 2014 grid (Caterham) received just under $60 million, the highest received just over $200 million (Ferrari), the mid point being the $80 million paid to Force India. And before everyone jumps up and down about cost inflation this [2004 economist article](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), when its numbers are ajusted for [inflation](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/38iptr/alex_yoong_with_a_2002_minardi_would_be_p4_on/crvfv3x), shows the front of the grid team's budget's have halved and the back of the grid outfit's budget's have remained the same over 11 years.

FOM's prize money distribution amounts to 1.3 billion or 64% of FOM's operating profit before tax and liabilities are accounted for. The bonus payments amounted to $195 million distributed among the top 5 teams making for only 10% of the operating profit.

<TEXT> No. They offered an 'extra' 8bn over inflation spread across 5 years on top of the 2 billion announced last year, which amounts to an additional 2 billion per year. That makes projected *government* spending in 2020 122 billion, problem is we already have planned *NHS* spending for 2020 at 146.4 billion, and the existing deficit is running around 700 million per year so Osborne actually announced an extra 1.3 billion a year in funding.

The overall funding gap (planned spending vs funding) is 30 billion (6 billion per year) between now and 2020 and the NHS is expected to find 22 billion in 'savings' (i.e. cuts) to close that gap over the same period whilst moving to a 7 day a week staffing model and executing the Stevens Report modernisation programme.

Only way to do this is cut wages at all levels while increasing hours.

What Osborne announced was actually less than a third of the money the NHS needs to operate at current service levels whilst Hunt announced a massive increase in mandated staffing hours. Basically it will translate into a real terms cut because even the chancellor admits finding 22 billion in savings is 'challenging' at best.

Patriarchy is an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women. It includes any social mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. 

Feminism isn't claiming that the men at the top of any given power structure have the same power as all men in that power structure - hence the fundamental idea behind the Apex Fallacy is complete bollocks.

Essentially what you're trying to claim by the use of the term is that feminism's concept of male privilege doesn't acknowledge the suffering of the poor downtrodden men at the bottom of a pyramid of power - who, as they see it, have no power or privilege, therefore there can be no such thing as male privilege or the patriarchy.

The fundamental argument as expressed by Dr. Helen Smith herself in an interview on the topic is this:-

The error in their thinking arises from a collective refusal to acknowledge that the vast majority of male workers toil in the nether regions of our economy. These hordes of men-who make possible feminist lives of leisure-are totally invisible to the harridans who compare women, on aggregate, to the rich and famous alone. Indeed, when judging female progress, juxtaposition is only made with those males at the apex of our status hierarchy. It seems that feminists can discern none but the elite.

Her error in thinking is as obvious as her bias - she is arguing against what *she* sees as the feminist core argument, and her problem is that she doesn't understand that core argument in the slightest. She believes that feminists are elitists and consider only socially powerful men in their thinking and has constructed a nonsense argument against a concept of feminism that she has herself created.

Again this is not the fallacy of composition at all - you would like it to be because that would lend credibility to both your term and argument but it one simply has nothing to do with the other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Apex fallacy was coined by a Conservative/Libertarian psychologist in order to refute what she sees as feminism's central argument - lack of equality of representation is lack of power.

Its popular among the men's rights idiots because it was coined by a woman who agrees with their twisted perspective on the world hence it being shipped by MRASJW's all over the place.

It is *not* analogous to the fallacy of composition no matter how hard to try to wish it is so. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It takes a depraved mind to see this and think, "Now that's an uplifting story!"

Speaking as the owner of that mind (I'm OP)... I thought it uplifting because, after seeing her grandparents die in front of her, a 16 year old had enough self possession to realise help was not on its way and find a way to save herself. It must have been an extraordinarily difficult two days for her.

She's one tough person and that deserves recognition - we should all aspire to such strength of mind when the chips are down.

<TEXT> I've just submitted my question for the London party leadership hustings:-

Like many members of the party I feel let down by the IndyRef, European, and General Election campaigns. As a party we do not appear to have answers to the big questions facing the country and cannot put up a fight. How will you refocus the party and move us forward?

Because this is how I feel about our policy positions and thus far I'm unconvinced by any of the leadership candidates. Their campaign's seem to be more focussed on party factionalism than any uniting vision for the party much less the country.

What is your question and why? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Easily - they were able to track the last mobile phone signal from the plane but that wasn't enough to pinpoint its location. Without an emergency beacon there would be nothing anyone could do to locate them more precisely. Many planes have one that activates on impact, but either that didn't work or this plane didn't have one.

People have some very fanciful ideas about what phone networks and mobile GPS can achieve in reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several things:-

This happened in Liverpool City Centre at 2am, there can't have been a great deal going on because the officers had time to be concerned with what they suspected might be a *minor* drugs offence - a 'crime' that most City Centre Police would ignore because they're there to deal with public order. 

The general policy is to avoid all but the most egregious offences in order to keep bodies on the street and keep the custody suite manageable in most *busy* town centres.

An arrest would put both officers back at the station for 4 hours while they dealt with the paperwork and if they were at the end of their shift they would get overtime - this was potentially their goal.

Don't disagree that both the officer and guy in question were being dicks, but the officers interest in such interest in such a common transaction and minor offence makes me very suspicious of their motives. There appears to have been no need to handcuff the chap to ask questions either - although we don't know what physical confrontation went on prior to the removal of the suspects phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lovely attitude towards the many Type 1, 1.5, and Type 2 Diabetics who have inherited the disease through their genes - doing nothing to deserve this horrible curse.

Many diabetics of all types will tell you that their Diabetes was preceded by a serious viral infection - and there is a weight of scientific research that supports that view.

I wonder if your wholly ignorant attitude will change when Altzheimers Disease turns out to be [Type 3 Diabetes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769828/)?

The overwhelming majority of Diabetics are not, and never have been, overweight. Many Diabetics struggle with their weight after diagnosis because the two main drugs that treat T2, and insulin for T1/1.5's cause weight gain as a side effect.. 

While there is a correlation between [abdominal central obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity) and Diabetes, it isn't a causative link, and no other types of obesity are linked to the illness. We still don't fully understand the nature of the link just as we don't fully understand Diabetes or [Metabolic Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome). 

There are plenty of fat people who are not diabetic, even in old age, and plenty of thin people who become Diabetic so your hypothesis that Diabetes is the fault of the person, inferring that it is a disease of overeating, is simply false.

<TEXT> IMO talk of Manor not racing next year is just overblown cynicism and misunderstands the facts. 

The team's losses are down to 4.7 million from over 57 million the previous year while revenue is up to 60 million. The 2014 prize money they are due to receive does not equate to a sensible reason for Stephen Fitzpatrick to fund the team and he has committed to at least 12 months further funding (until June next year). In short they've survived the crisis and can now try and rebuild the team.

They're gaining sponsors, surprisingly Mehri isn't a pay driver, and they had a legitimate shot a points at Silverstone - its going to take at least two years but they're getting there. </TEXT>

Cue discussion on cost caps: They don't work because any team can form and fund an outside company to develop tech and then sell it to the team for a peppercorn amount - the FIA cannot oversee the teams to the required extent that would prove this is happening or to prevent it happening. See salary caps in any sport. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There isn't anything wrong with radio communications and it's very hard to know whats going on with a modern car without information on whats happening with the tyres. Doing something like this will have three immediate effects:-

- The team *really* will make the cars easier to drive because there is only so much one person can do behind the wheel and you can't make the car work without knowing the tyre temps.
- The teams will change the tyre specs to make life easier for the drivers.
- The teams will just furnish the information now delivered over the radio in the cockpit displays.

Basically all of this is down to the fact that fans, at last, can hear some of whats happening on the radio (and has been happening since radios went in to F1) and in frustration are using that increased knowledge to draw spurious conclusions.

For the millionth time fans in this sub say the golden eras of F1 are the 80s and 00's and those are periods where the sport was a dictatorship and there were no limits on radio messages. This kind of information being delivered to the drivers isn't new or any kind of problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uswitch is little more than fancy classified ads - their top recommendations are paid for promotional spots. 

MSE used to be good but the banks and energy companies are manipulating the results using their referral schemes (which is how MSE makes money). Basically they only allow the sites to advertise certain things which limits the possible recommendations.

You rely on the energy company for the data that makes these sites work, but they use estimated billing to inflate the figures which limits the recommended tariffs further.

Look into the business model that underlies this system. It's basically predatory. </TEXT>

<TITLE> PSA: Update on tube strike: No service from 6pm Wednesday until early Friday morning. Disruption expected Friday </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-07 19:55:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
The ASLEF, RMT, Unite and TSSA unions are currently planning strike action, affecting Tube services. If this goes ahead, we expect the following: 

Wednesday 8 July
Tube services will stop running at around 18:00, so please complete any Tube journeys by that time. Services are expected to be exceptionally busy between 16:00 and 18:00. Please travel earlier if you can and allow more time for your journey. 

Thursday 9 July
There will be no Tube service all day. Extra bus and river services will run. Other public transport and roads will be much busier than usual, especially during peak hours. Please travel outside the peak times if you can. 

Friday 10 July
There may be some disruption during the morning as services resume. 

Staff on the bus network, the DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Trams, river services, Emirates Air Line and Santander Cycles are not on strike. There is separate strike action by the RMT on First Great Western services from Thursday 9 July for 48-hours. As always, we advise you to check with your train operator or national rail enquiries. All of these services are expected to be much busier than usual.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really no - the supposed theory behind utility privatisation was that the companies through being more efficient would yield savings and these would be passed on to the consumer. They would also be pressured by free market competition into providing stable and competitive pricing rather than price gouging - but of course the economies of scale to allow this to happen didn't exist in the market as it was privitised.

In fact what happened is that the privatised companies were conglomerated by large european utility companies into near monopolies and, as there was virtually no real money in the consumer energy market, all became vertically integrated (owning generation as well as supply). They were successful in their efforts to craft legislation that benefited them because as both the supplier and generator the government was utterly beholden to them for a functioning energy market, so there is essentially no competition.

Ultimately privatisation made the government accounts look good for a brief period and the public was instead bilked for more money from its own pocket book rather than the government's. The Tory governments bathed themselves in their smug free market glow - but as usual the public paid nasally - the government still pays for the distribution infrastructure via our taxes, the public pays more than it should for energy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 70% of all consumers, regardless of switching, paid more than they should have - basically the market is dysfunctional and operates to the benefit of the businesses, not the consumers.

In order to obtain the 'best' (whatever that actually means) deal you *have* to move every 12 months and you are entirely reliant on third party meta business for information on what is or isn't the best deal. Those third party businesses don't operate to the benefit of the consumer because their income stream is dependent on referral or product placement fees from the businesses they recommend.

At no stage in any of this is the consumer actually the customer, so the market responds to the needs of government and businesses, not the consumer.

Same problem in the rail industry - government is the customer not the end user. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beginning in September, about 40 community meetings will be held across Australia, possibly culminating in a national convention. The aim is to reach consensus on precisely how the constitution should be changed, and to agree a question to be put to the electorate in 2017. Even Aboriginal leaders, though, are divided on issues such as whether a clause outlawing racial discrimination should be written into the document.

It would seem so, or at least there is a process in place that will hopefully lead to a referendum securing the double majority needed to change the constitution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is three unions rather than just the RMT, and two of those unions haven't attempted strike action in a decade.

While I don't think the RMT behave reasonably and frequently seem tone deaf in approaching strike action, having worked inside the underground system designing software for them, the tube unions have a *very* real point about pay and conditions. NHS staff, particularly the nurses, could learn a great deal from their approach to collective bargaining.

The figures bandied around for what tube drivers earn are mostly nonsense and far from the average wage. Conditions have reached a point where drivers are having to limit their fluid intake because they can't easily use the toilet. Some of what goes on down there beggars belief.

It's also worth pointing out that the RMT's successful bargaining means they're the only group of labourers in the country whose wages have kept pace with inflation decadally - it's not that the drivers are overpaid, it's that everyone else is underpaid. </TEXT>

None of those diffusers would have worked without Renault's design efforts - not one.

Mercedes did a fantastic job getting their engine into a chassis designed for Honda's PU, but Brawn said at the time that they picked Mercedes as a supplier because it was the engine that 'best fitted' the chassis they had.

Sure Renault find themselves in a bad situation, no worse than any in the history of the sport, but still very bad. But it's not 100% their fault. They don't appear to have a partner they can work together with to solve the *team's* problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh god, the usual quote-back/you're stupid nonsense from the Kiptard contingent. *sigh*. Called stupid in less than three comments FFS - I wish I was surprised.

- We're not talking about the Tories and criticism of one party's policy isn't an automatic comparison with or acceptance of any other party's policy.

- UKIP say they want to *increase* defense spending to 2% of GDP, but our existing spending is 2.1% of GDP down from 2.4% in 2010. They also want to go back to 2010 troop levels and capability whilst replacing trident and spending around 400 million on a dedicated military hospital. Usual inconsistency from UKIP but this all adds up to a *huge* increase in defense oriented spending.

- Yes they do favor harsh restrictions on immigrants and their policy actually is a disincentive to the free-trade policy they advocate elsewhere. Read the manifesto and think through the effect of their policy. If, for example, a senior member of a US company wanted to move here they would be dragged through a points based system (this takes 12 - 18 months right now and costs 3 - 5k) and so would their family members wishing to join them - each family member would have to pass the same system as the policy is presently written.

- They want to leave the the world's largest free trade bloc (the EU) in order to make free-trade agreements with every other country independently.

They advocate no other forms of international cooperation other than trade and specifically wish to favor the 'Anglosphere' when trading.

<TEXT> I think they'd like to claim they're libertarians and there are certainly elements of libertarian policy in their dicta, but they're as fundamentally Statist of a group as I can think of having read the manifesto - they're certainly not a party of small government given the sheer volume of rules they wish to impose.

They want huge increase in defence spending, their base favors harsh policing and criminal justice policies, harsh restrictions on immigrants and they anti-international co-operation on anything but trade and even then they'd like it all their own way - all authoritarian values.

<TEXT> When you look at enacted policy across the political spectrum in this country you realise that all governments are centre right, and there is an obvious decadal rightward drift among all parties - inertia meaning that the further right UKIP drift, the further right *all* parties drift. 

By enacted policy there isn't a credible centrist party in the UK, nor is there a credible left wing party, although there are parties that have left wing members and some elements of traditional left wing ideas - all parties are centre right. How individuals view their party alignments appears to me to be a function of where they think the centre is more than any other factor.

That drift is most obvious in the US right now (although UKIP's effect on all party's policy demonstrates the same effect). Obama is basically a Reagan era moderate Republican with liberal personal social values, and the Republicans have gone so far to the right that they sound like a fringe party on almost any subject. Trump's candidacy being the zenith of that drift.

Churchill for example had this to say on the NHS:-

The discoveries of healing science must be the inheritance of all. That is clear: Disease must be attacked,  whether it occurs in the poorest or the richest man or woman simply on the ground that it is the enemy; and it must be attacked just in the same way as the fire brigade will give its  full assistance to the humblest cottage as readily as to the  most important mansion.Our policy is to create a national health service in order to ensure that everybody in the country, irrespective of means, age, sex, or occupation, shall have equal opportunities to benefit from the best and most up-to-date medical and allied services available.

No modern Conservative would recognise the post war Conservative party's policy positions as being truly Conservative outside of their views on personal social policy i.e. homosexuality and marrige. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Friedman assumed that 'people' would all, or at least mostly, be shareholders in the corporations and there would therefore be social pressure on these organisations to act toward the benefit of the communities they were part of as well as financial benefit for everyone.

That hasn't happened. Major corporations are owned, in the main, by other corporations, institutions, and private investment companies - and therefore act only in the interests of increasing financial reward at all costs. Meaning, sadly, those corporations have no social value at all.

If there is a single problem in the capitalist system we now live in it's shareholder value versus social value - there is too much of the former and not enough of the latter. </TEXT>

- Call your local councillors, get a meeting with them and your neighbourhood policing team to discuss what action can be taken. Bring neighbours along, show that the problem is affecting many people.

- Ensure you call 101 *every* time this happens. The response will be useless but if the neighbourhood team don't have the reports coming from CAD they won't be allowed the resources to deal with the problem.

<TEXT> That's not true at all. Renault deserve enormous credit for innovations like RBR's many diffusers - which rely on Renault engineers and installers to make them work on the car.

F1 is a team sport, the chassis does not work without the engine and you can't bugger about with the movement of exhaust gases at the back of the car in any way without tremendous work from your engine and fuel suppliers.

This isn't the middle school playground and the amount of crass, uninformed bitching going on these days is ruining many of the discussions on this sub.

The early part of every engine era is marked by these kind of problems - this is how we advance our understanding of technologies and create innovative leaps.

Knowing, for example, that I can obtain a 3rd party part for n amount doesn't mean that I know, or can find out, the cost of the manufacturer part and it doesn't tell me the price range vs quality of third party parts. 

It also doesn't allow me determine the amount of labour required. The part on the car may be seized or corroded - it may take time to get *to* the part that needs to be replaced.

<TEXT> I think in the background of all of this they were attempting a political takeover of the sport through breaking up FOTA and looking towards a commercial rights buyout - but they lost the battle over the regs and were outmaneuvered by Mercedes politically as well as outperformed on the track. 

CVC was an odd partner choice at the time but my guess is this was Bernie outmaneuvering a RBR aligned buyer. Its interesting that a company led by the man who sued Bernie for bribery is now in the frame to buy the commercial rights, along with a Quatari company with links to RBR.

This is why RBR have chucked their toys out of the pram, they lost the battles and lost the war. Now they're stuck with Renault because they don't want a 'B' Ferrari engine, can't have a Mercedes one, can't get an 'A' spec Honda engine (Ron Dennis isn't stupid), and don't have any other options.

But they have overplayed their hand again and pissed Renault off. Now they have no remaining options. </TEXT>

I have friends who have to find an additional 55 a week on top of their housing benefit to pay the rent, but only get 53 a week spending money. In effect the government is running people into arrears to reduce the deficit and using a moral approach to the argument rather than a pragmatic one.

Its a complicated job to replace them as you have to take the front end off the car to get to the lamp housings otherwise I'd have done it myself (I did try, but conditions in my driveway are too cramped). The rest of the work was new suspension arm rubber bushes all round, osf suspension arm ball joint dust cover, nsf/osf tie rod rubber bush, pads, discs, and a brake caliper (all the brake calipers were seized) plus a new centre brake light.

The house of commons and government essentially gave up on consumer regulation, especially of finance, 30 years ago. We've come to specialise in toothless regulatory bodies that are expensive to run and produce pathetic outcomes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its hard to say without knowing the role specifics or skillset but a team lead / manager / senior engineer in desktop support is around 50k GBP at the top end of the market. General desktop support worker is around 25k.

50k is also where you'd come out in a straight currency conversion from $78k so I'd suggest that what you should seek.

Average income in the UK is around 24k, subsistence level income in London is around 20k so you should be comfortably off on 50k. 

To give you some idea of pricing. A Zone 1 - 3 weekly travelcard (covers bus, train, tram and tube) is 37.70, a pint of beer is 4.50 - 4.80 depending on the area, chinese takeaway is around 7 - 10 per head, a Starbucks Grande Latte is 2.60 as is a Big Mac. </TEXT>

I just re-read the thread. Normally I assume that people can understand things when they're explained properly, but the brain crushing ignorance of KipTards just staggers me. You'll literally say anything, vomit out any crap, to try and pretend you have a point no matter the weight of evidence to the contrary - the stuff you've written above about the free trade areas is just... crap. Total unmitigated crap. I'm actually surprised you can operate a computer.

<TEXT> I laughed out loud reading this, rarely has a Kipper managed to spout so much nonsense in one comment.

- Manufacturers want to sell one product to one set of regulations in as many places as possible, so much so that they often design around the cross regulation issues. You'll notice that many new cars have daytime running lights which allow them to be sold in scandinavian markets, and left/right headlight switches so the same vehicle can be sold in the UK and France with only software changes. Regulation codes are the single biggest problem businesses have and business spends tens of millions each year lobbying for changes.

- ONR is an operational safety body, it does not design or spec nuclear reactors and you, sir, are obviously an idiot to claim what you have here. Hinkley Point C, the first of eight UK sites, is presently being constructed. It's two *European* Pressurised Reactors are being built to a French Design which has become an EU standard by two French companies. EDF, one of those companies, will own the land and the plant along with the output (we are of course subsiding the build). This makes sense since they bought British Energy lock stock and barrel in 2009 and basically now own our entire nuclear industry. If we leave the EU this will prove highly problematic because their business runs to EU standards and is regulated by the EU, not us. Same situation in rail, water, fossil energy, parts of the oil industry, and Alliance Boots (our largest Pharmacy network) is also wholly European owned.

- I've worked for SWIFT, you simply don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about there. I assumes from the crap you've vomited that you simply read wiki. Iran isn't even the only country barred from the network.

- ISO manage the standards that US and now UK plugs are built to, because NEMA and BS have harmonised their standards through ISO. The UK is a voting member of ISO so we do actually have a role in the electrical and manufacturing standards US plugs are built to.

I see that you have become confused after claiming:

The current situation with the EU is the exception, leaving the EU would just put us in the same position we are with every other country.


And could not understand it when you were so obviously wrong. 

In fact almost all countries in the world are involved in some kind of economic integration or free trade area - there is even a handy  [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#Operating_agreements) showing how wrong you are. The list next to it shows many free trade areas, and our ability to trade in those areas is conducted through the EU. So leaving the EU wouldn't put the UK in the 'same position as every other country' as you claim, it would actually set us at odds with the overwhelming majority of other countries.

Many Tories and Kippers claimed during Indyref that Scotland couldn't possibly renegotiate all these agreements and would therefore be unable to trade across large parts of the world. The same applies to England.

Your UKIPCrapFu is obviously strong, having made personal attacks claim the other person started it and you show classic KipTard misdirection when wrong - shout louder, claim the opposition is stupid and hope nobody notices how wrong you are.

Seriously, there is a whole world out there if you would just educate yourself about how it operates.

<TEXT> The net effect of UKIP's immigration and trade policy together will achieve exactly that - and that is by design. Few if any would make it through the system he is proposing and each family member that wanted to join them would have to go through the same points based process. Its profoundly ludicrous and a profound disincentive to business.

The answer to your second question is 'How can you have free trade for businesses without a free labour market for people?' You can't. If a business is free to trade with another in the UK how can it do so when every member of its staff has to be dragged through the same months long process in order to complete a simple deal. They'll just go find a partner in a country with less restrictive policies - there are many to choose from. How could a manufactuer set up a UK base and bring over experienced staff to train new staff under those circumstances!

UKIP *is* proposing that the UK should stand alone. Farage's fantasy is that outside the EU the size of the UK economy will be attractive enough that we will be able to make trade deals with everyone. He stated exactly this in a recent EU speech on the African migrant crisis - he wants an end to all free trade blocs in order to allow everyone to trade together. He doesn't seem to understand that this didn't work the first time around.

So why would America waste their time on a trade deal with one country when you could access the EU with only one deal, and use that as leverage to access NAFTA? It wouldn't happen - because it doesn't happen. Almost every country on earth is part of a [free trade bloc or union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#Operating_agreements) for a reason. You'll notice the ones that aren't are not exactly economic powerhouses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. But it all depends on where you think the centre is. 

The right wing justices voted with the Obama administration more this term than the left wing judges did, meaning the Obama administration won just 38% of its cases compared to an average between 60 - 70% per term for governments of all stripes. 

Scalia was in the majority in only 48 percent of this terms cases and Thomas in only 33 percent, which is historically low and very telling of the position of the court overall.

Also it wasn't just two issues on which the court leaned left - of course there was marriage equality, housing discrimination, Obamacare, and legislative districting but also a whole host of criminal justice issues that received much less attention (see link below).

It appears two forces are at work, the court has indeed leaned left this term, and the Obama administration has taken a much more authoritarian tack on criminal justice cases (but realistically everyone has a distorted view of the centre because both Republicans and Democrats are, by enacted policy, centre right parties).

[The two justices](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/supreme_court_liberal_on_criminal_justice_issues_clarence_thomas_sided_with.html) who cast the most votes against the administration this term were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, each opposing the administration in 71 percent of the cases. Justice Sonia Sotomayor isnt far behind, voting against the administration 67 percent of the time. Who voted the most with the administration? Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy, who each sided with the administration more often than not (in 52 percent of the cases). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you look at it from a short term perspective sure. The problem is that growing up in poverty limits both your prospects, your lifetime earnings, and increases the amount you need from the state, thereby limiting your contribution to the state. Its basically a generational problem and we are seeing record low levels of social mobility.

So insisting that another generation grow up with low educational attainment and spend their lives stuck in nothing jobs is simply spawning a new generation of benefit claimants.

Minimum incomes actually assist in resolving a long term problems and reduce future welfare bills. </TEXT>

The money F1 generates from TV rights is around $650 million a year, with another $650 million from race fees - this covers the $1.1 billion a year distributed to the teams.

A globalised streaming solution for F1, no matter how much I might desire one, isn't going to generate that kind of revenue, and that will directly affect the viability of the middle and lower grid teams.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its inconsistent because you say you want free trade, but then say that all markets must be regulated. What Farage, and apparently you, are seeking is deregulated trade markets with heavy personal border restrictions - two policies completely at odds with each other. Even Australia doesn't do this.

So you're happy to have your products regulated by the EU, and have companies regulated by the EU (which includes our entire nuclear industry, water industry, rail, energy, our largest pharmacy networks - all of which would be regulated by the EU because they're all owned by European companies), but have no control over that regulation? Really? I suppose that kind of illogic is what I should expect from Kippers.

We do have a means of regulating how banks in China and banks worldwide operate, its called SWIFT, it's based in Brussels and it controls and operates the network which connects all banks globally. Banks have to meet and observe certain standards to use it, and the EU regulates the trade of foreign owned banks operating within the EU.

We also have a voting role in regulating standards for American plugs through the International Standards Organisation incidentally.

The current situation is far from the exception. We are members of the World Trade Organisation via the EU, our interface with NAFTA is through the EU, as is our interface with the Asian Free Trade Area, Indian Free Trade Area, The Common Market For East and Southern Africa and dozens of others - EVERYONE is in a free trade area of some kind, as this handy [map shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#/media/File:Economic_integration_stages_(World).png)

So, as I said earlier, Kippers want to leave all of that and sulk behind their little wall while everyone else trades happily together. 

Frankly the mendacious crap spewed by the likes of Farage and yourself appals me - you're astonishingly ignorant of world trade and how the world actually operates but sit there and snipe like you know what you're talking about.

Read a book, learn something FFS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My, how deeply you have sucked on the head of Faragian wisdom. Sorry but the world just doesn't work that way - it never has.

A minute ago you were advocating free trade (Farage's vision is no restrictions on trade at all), but now 'every market must be regulated' - how inconsistent. Its not a false premise because one market feeds the other.

Incase you hadn't noticed the vehicle standards you refer to are the EuroEncap Standards - based on DfT research in the 80s - and its the EU that does the regulating. We would simply stick to those standards because we don't have a standards body (it wouldn't matter if we did), but we wouldn't have any say in what they were. Just as British vehicles sold overseas already obey those countries standards without involvement in the regulation.

Its the same with trade - we would be free to trade with whomever we wanted, so long as we obeyed their standards, but we would have no role at all in determining those standards. Norway, oft cited by Farage, says that it simply does what the EU asks (their trade minister laughed at Farage's comments and that's why our Nige stopped talking about them).

So the world Kippers are seeking is one in which Britian sits behind a wall and obeys every command given to it.

<TEXT> Our trading block is with the EU, they are the body through which we make trade agreements with the rest of the world. So, no, there isn't more to the world than the EU where trade is concerned.

But the most important questions underlying the debate are "How can you have free trade for business without a similarly free labour market for people?" and "How can you hope to compete economically with Russia, China, US   Canada, and the BRIC countries standing alone?"

Farage's answer is to close all borders to people, allow the businesses to do what they like, and hope our products are so good people will demand them and we don't lose the inevitable trade wars.

UKIP would like to close our borders and vet everyone who comes through against a points system - no other country does this or can do this, not even Australia - a country that has a half a dozen different immigration systems.

Farage just doesn't understand how immigration systems actually work worldwide and his theories on trade are a complete joke. People were having to stifle laughs during is recent speech on Africa. The man is an ignoramus.

Everything else is petty window dressing - you can tell that by the way Farage argues for a Aussie based points based system despite the fact that we have a points based immigration systems based on the Aussie one and have had since 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Driverless cars are basically developing the sensors and control systems we need to make home robotics a reality, but we're not as close to working consumer or business technology in both fields as it seems. 

Google's car still can't handle adverse weather or traffic lights with the Sun behind them, and extensive, timely, satellite scans of the route it's driving are required before it can traverse them.

VR headsets suffer from the 3DTV/4k problem, you need content and no one is developing enough of it, and the kit is awkward to use. It reminds me to a certain extent of early 80s video games - cool, innovative, but not ready for the mass market.

I could be wrong but I suspect both technologies will lead to the creation of revolutionary technologies but won't be as popular as it seems now in themselves mainly because the barriers to consumer adoption are high. 

Most revelatory technologies solve problems that a large body of people have - which leads to fast adoption and quickly declining prices, others start out as premium products and gradually become affordable, but I'm not certain there is a premium market for driverless cars, even the business transport market is tenuous outside of rail. So I suspect the market for driverless will look a lot more like Tesla than Ford. The number of technology companies in the game suggests the IP in the market is valuable in and of itself even if it doesn't lead to a product.

If we couldn't get people to wear 3D glasses long term will people accept VR headsets?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly I think the question is irrelevant, although I sympathise with the view, because the more important question is "how can you have free trade for businesses without a free labour market for people?"

The free labour market was never going to help anyone that didn't recognise that to extract personal benefit from it that they were going to have to increase their skills and become a more marketable commodity in the workforce.

The government stepped in to fill the gap but was unable to increase the minimum wage adequately to balance the payouts to only the worst affected. </TEXT>

Generally speaking applying means testing to anything adds layers of bureaucracy that often inflict more inequalities than they solve, and I can't see any evidence that it's a huge enough problem to justify the staff time required. 

Are there really hordes of wealthy pensioner processing reams of paperwork for benefits they don't need? 

All that said if its a problem that can be tackled with minimal extra expenditure and the rules around it aren't so tight that they disenfranchise people on the dividing line then I have no strong objection. </TEXT>

Immigration is doing a great job of filling in the gap in the short term, but to fill in the long term gap we need to have more kids (we basically need more middle class kids so we need to incentivise certain economic groups to have kids).

Basically if you stop shopping at Tesco you don't have to worry about Tesco going under. If you're a government that's a real concern so you have to be very careful. An awful lot of jobs depend on public infrastructure, so cutting spending often increases the problem.

<TEXT> Mainly avoid attempts at one hit solutions, black and white answers, or demonising groups of people as 'the problem' - there are no simple solutions - you have to pull gently on lots of economic leavers not hard on a single one. Also not calling it a merry-go-round would also help since the entire economy is essentially a merry-go-round writ large.

Getting over the idea that national economies work like household accounts would really help and might actually allow people to see the real problems.

Immigration and the increasing birth rate suggest that the scale of the problem has slowed dramatically since 2000 when we were on the edge of not replacing our existing population, but we need:-

- Better education and skills training of all kinds - this lifts incomes, it really is that simple.
- Free education - burdening kids helps no one.
- Ending child poverty - your childhood economic status determines your lifetime earnings. 
- Rethink pensions and the retirement age - the current rate of growth is simply not sustainable. 
- Employers *have* to pay a living wage - we can't continue to subsidise low paid workers in the way we have.
- Reduce housing costs - they have to come down drastically everywhere at every level.
- Immigration - we need as many working age adults as we can get.
- Employment inequalities exist - they must end for everyone, we need to increase the workforce.
- Incentivise having more children - we really do need more people.

Broadly we need to get over the idea that there is such a thing as deserving and undeserving. Even if you pay into the system for 50 years you still take more from it than you put in - the gulf between input and output there is so huge that no increase in contributions will close it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The UK workforce is 29.68 million of 64.1 million people. The remainder are under / over age or economically inactive (house parents, carers etcetera).

Literally less than half the country support the other half.

The issue that underlies the whole debate is child poverty and elder care. The average size of a pension pot in 2015 is 22,000, the average cost of caring for an elderly person where I live is 106,000 a year. 

Pensions are triple locked and can only go up, and any measure that tackles child poverty (the single defining issue for the earning prospects of the future workforce) has to raise the average salary of the poorest workers.

Broadly only societal group who don't take out more than they put in are the group aged 35 - 45, at the height of their earning potential, and there simply aren't enough of them to support the rest of society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the reasons (ignored by this article) that the growth in employment is happening at the lower end of the market is that more elderly people are working and seeking work - but its obviously more complicated that that.

The average pension pot is 22,000 the average cost of elder care in my part of the country is 106,000 a year. So even if you fall into the 'worked all their lives' category you're still drawing far more from the system than you could have put in.

The real problem is the age dependency ratio - we still don't have enough working adults to support the system overall no matter who you pay the money to and no matter if you think those in receipt of the money are deserving or not.

<TEXT> Personally I see this tension as the core of the issue. 

There are groups that want to view marriage as a purely religious construct and therefore their rejection of LGBQT marriage or anything associated with it is a matter of personal freedom of choice and therefore protected - but that simply isn't the case and it hasn't been for a very long time because of the depth of legal status of marriage in national and international law. 

Attempting to limit access to marriage denies fundamental freedoms to LGBQT people - freedoms so fundamental that most people barely think of them or realise that they're even there until they don't have them.

Ultimately everyone is free to accept or reject LGBQT marriage in their personal lives, but they don't' have the right to impose their beliefs on other people in society and thereby limit other's freedoms for no good reason. 

Why wouldn't a baker, for example, that doesn't wish to service LGBQT couples simply put a sign in their shop window to that effect? This would save everyone embarrassment! The reason is that they know that such a sign would hurt their business even among the straight community - in other words they *know* that there is a difference between their personal beliefs and the functionality of their work.

On the company issue, I don't have a problem with your position and I don't think it's bigoted, but I do think it's unrealistic. Can we really live in a society where the personal religious views of a company's CEO affect *your* partner's ability to receive part of *your* pension should you die? Equally if that is the standard then why couldn't a company turn around and refuse to pay survivor benefits to anyone regardless of their sexuality - these things cut both ways. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Your MP is someone who will steadily sacrifice all individual rights in an effort to defeat invincible encryption.

This is cynicism. You failed to even attempt to understand this person's perfectly reasonable position and dismissed it out of hand. I don't agree with her position, but I at least recognise it as accurate from a statist standpoint.

I say this as a 20 year IT veteran. *There is no privacy* the idea that there was at some stage some kind of privacy in our lives was a construct based on security by obscurity i.e. government and private enterprise was in possession of much data in paper or quasi-digital form but lacked the tools to centralise, regurgitate and mine the data in a meaningful way - obviously that has changed significantly.

Recently a security firm went out in Victoria Street in London and asked people for their passwords and email addresses in return for a free coffee or a chocolate bar - 78% of respondents provided those details - that is how little people care about their own privacy, security, and that of their employer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a very big thing indeed - its all very well for people to argue that marriage is a religious status alone but that simply isn't the case in modern society - so many of our legal systems and international laws are built on conveying rights via the simple term 'marriage' that those without the ability to marry are quickly deprived of basic rights by simply stepping over an international border.

Survivor benefits could indeed be conveyed by contracts but there are a couple of big problems with that. Firstly it's within the discretion of the company - Apple will pay out, Hobby Lobby won't. Secondly when it comes to insurance its a matter of the legal term - legally they're only required to recognise the status of certain relationships and without a change in the law that doesn't happen because it would increase costs - this leads to LGBQT people paying more for certain kinds of insurance and having to have specially drawn up wills etcetera.

<TEXT> Yes to the former. The term 'marriage' is codified into so many international laws, treaties and intra-legal system recognition agreements that LGBQT couples literally need to be in something called a 'marriage' to obtain basic rights when travelling or moving overseas.

To be clear a same-sex couple with a civil partnership conducted in the UK could not emigrate to Canada as a married couple because the UK law isn't recognised there. If the same couple were travelling in Canada and were in a serious accident the partners would be unable to make medical decisions for one and other, and in some cases their family (if they disapprove of the marriage) may seek to prevent one from even seeing the other (sadly this has happened).

Re:survivor benefits - if your marriage isn't recognised you wouldn't be able to obtain life insurance payouts, death benefits from an employer, pension payouts etc. This leaves the surviving partners in a very tricky financial position. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is. But...

Here in the UK Churchill (a lion of the right wing) didn't consider the NHS or Welfare State Socialist, and wrote as much. That's not a position that a modern Conservative in England would recognise. Our right has drifted further right in some policy areas to the point that in policy terms, thanks to inertia, there is no recognisably left or centrist party - I'm beginning to wonder if left/right is even a useful distinction.

In the US the GOP has gone *so* far right/authoritarian that it's practically a fringe party - but the Democrats are, as a function of that drift, being pulled further right in order to hold their electoral coalition together. So Obama's Democratic party are essentially occupying the same economic space as Reagan albeit with a much more liberal view of society and individual freedoms.

I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing to be honest with you. </TEXT>

Everyone is complaining about the engine regs, but, looking at the rate of token spend, the problems Renault and Honda have are way more fundamental than even unlimited development could fix. They can't make the systems they have work.

Also F1 is a business as are the teams. From Mercedes perspective they've invested four years and close to a billion dollars on that car - how is it then fair to ask them to basically cease their development and allow the other teams to catch up? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ultimately its a business decision - Raikkonen's performance issues have dragged the team's media coverage into negative territory for two season's straight - drowning out positive coverage of Ferrari's nascent improvement this year and becoming constant distraction for the team.

I say this as a huge Kimi fan who thinks he should have been a three time WDC winner. Kimi is a serious problem for Ferrari. He isn't delivering on track and he's not promoting the team well either - his 'fuck you' approach to media was refreshing when he was delivering in races, now it just looks foolish and unengaged.

Ferrari could get a more consistent driver which would do more for their image and performance elsewhere very easily. Bottas appears to be the obvious choice, IMO it should be Hulkenberg or Ricciardo, but at this point any of them would be better than the present situation (Sadly. Very sadly in fact.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I very much doubt that you have any experience or knowledge in the sector given the crass nature of your remarks and total ignorance of the law as it pertains to contracts and housing. 

What I said was that statutory protections for *tenants* would be a good place to start. Statutory Government safety standards for types of rented accommodation are *not* protection *of* tenants *from* landlords any more than the British Standards Kite Mark is protection of the consumer from harm - they concern quality standards and/or safety of product, not individual rights in a dispute. 

The only way a tenant can fight a non-financial, eviction, or semi-financial dispute with a landlord is in the civil courts (you would know this if you knew what you were talking about). I really don't know why the SCC is so important to you - it offers a service to landlords for rent arrears and has little use for tenants.

Anyway this isn't a discussion, you're completely wrong in what you had to say, and saying it with crass embellishments just makes you sound dumb.

<TEXT> Umm, no. I can see you have absolutely no experience of such matters and a poor attitude - 'hand holding' - really? What an ignorant thing to say.

There are standards for HMO's, which in *some* areas have to be licenced and inspected prior to letting, and there are standards for private rented accommodation which *should* be observed but these are *not* statutory protections for the tenant with criminal penalties attached - they concern the council's relationship with the landlord alone and the enforcement is exclusively civil. 

A tenant can complain and environmental health might turn up in 6 months and issue a letter to a private landlord requesting changes and threatening legal action if they don't undertake the prescribed work, but enforcement only takes place for serious multiple breaches and its a ponderous process. This does not affect the contractual relationship between landlord and tenant - it most certainly does not overrule the contract in the slightest which is an entirely separate legal document dealt with mainly by the county courts.

As to the small claims court you cannot take landlord/tenant (act) disputes to it, as it deals with money alone. You can pursue debts that way so it's of little use to tenants but very popular with landlords. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actual statutory rights for tenants (contracts are only worth the opposite parties ability to prosecute the contract in civil court), and a legal service that resolves landlord/ tenant disputes without dragging them through the county courts for years at massive expense to both parties would be a good start.

Protection from predatory landlords and letting agents, working environmental health services - the list is endless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you can take that view if you wish but [experts in the sector disagree](http://www.propertyreporter.co.uk/property/could-tackling-multiple-home-ownership-assist-housing-crisis.html). In reality multiple home ownership isn't a symptom at all but one of a number of primary causes - lack of house building is another - all of which need intensive action.

We cant keep building to accommodate demand, land is in short supply, particularly in locations where people most want to live. In reality, there is plenty of property, but with some investors owning numerous buy-to-let properties, prices continue to rise making it impossible for first-time buyers to pull together enough deposit to make that first step.

<TEXT> The idea itself is not so fanciful, its basically what we do with a large number of shared ownership properties in the social housing sector - short term tenancies are a disaster for many in generation rent, disrupt social cohesion, and a fix for that problem is badly needed.

And in fact he does get it. There is a housing crisis in this country - private let landlords have benefited and continue to benefit from [14 Billion in tax breaks](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/landlords-14bn-tax-breaks-buy-to-let-expansion-mortgage-interest) - they are a group that has grossly profited from their own shrinking of the housing stock which by turns pushed up house prices whilst pushing locals out.

Personally I'd much rather listen to some radical ideas on the topic than the baleful ignorance of Cameron and co whilst they plunder the working poor and disabled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could argue the same thing about any trained profession but, as you say, retention is a huge problem within the NHS because (having half a dozen nurses in the family) many trusts treat nurses extremely poorly, pay is relatively low, and conditions can be dreadful. There is little flexibility so nurses like my sister, despite having the PhD level highly specialised qualifications required for top end intensive care nursing, end up in 9 - 5 desk jobs because the trusts can't think of a better way to handle her having a family.

All that said its also true, from a UK economic perspective, that people who receive degree level training earn far more through their lifetimes than people with lower skills qualifications and contribute more to the economy. So it actually doesn't matter if they stay in the profession the country still benefits economically.

Non degree average starting salaries are  17k compared to  31k for those with a degree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bernie doesn't own the rights to stream anything, streaming licensing is organised at national broadcaster level e.g. Sky in the UK, RTL in Germany etcetera.

This is why a global streaming solution isn't happening. If FOM wanted to do this they would have to amend the terms of every existing F1 broadcaster contract and/or pay the broadcasters for the privilege of streaming their own race. Even that would only solve half the problem. FOM provides the TV pictures as part of their licensing agreement but it's the broadcasters that own the IP for the commentary and the would have to be paid for that.

50% of the prize fund that the teams get comes to F1 via broadcast rights, so you would also have to be careful not to hurt the teams financially when making the deals to put a streaming solution together.

TL;DR Streaming F1 races has nothing to do with Bernie or FOM because of the way the broadcast licences are organised. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are his comments on German TV much different than in English? I've always wondered how much not speaking their native language affects what people like Lauda, Alonso and Massa have to say and how they come across in interviews.

Seb's generation obviously grew up speaking English from a young age and his command is amazing - he has colloquialisms, understands and uses sarcasm, tone, inflection etcetera - many other drivers don't seem to have as much depth. With Massa especially I often wonder how much we're missing of what he's really thinking.

<TEXT> Couple of things. For one many EU nationals that end up homeless in London are actually working homeless, they're just too poorly paid to afford housing even 'sheds with beds'. This is symptom of the housing crisis and there is plenty a Mayor of London can do about that.

For another many mayors when facing similar problems create repatriation schemes or stage advertising campaigns in other countries to dissuade people from coming to begin with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've (and many others) have said it time and again - the benefits to 'ordinary' working class people for free movement of people and more generally an open immigration policy NEEDS to be made.

I think most people especially in this sub, from the way 'ordinary working class' is routinely used, think of the working class as those engaged in un/semi skilled manual or industrial work and forget completely about the working poor. The definition is in fact those without the ability to live on accumulated capital. That includes increasing amounts people especially with the continuing housing crisis and the piles of student debt being accrued. You've got to throw down 5,000 to get a HGV licence these days on top of 2k to learn to drive a car - a near impossibility for many people at 18 no matter if you're working or middle class.

As far a the benefits of freedom of movement go for 'working class' people go, you have to be in a position to move to realise them.

Care workers, oil rig workers, IT workers and the like are all part of the modern working class can, and have, realised benefits by moving overseas where they are better paid or gain better quality of life - but the reality is that if you're on an hourly waged shift work job in a factory in Northampton freedom of movement is only going to put your wages under pressure. The only way to change that is to educate better and ensure access to education and skills training is freely available to all.

<TEXT> Exactly right - it has been on the BBC London news though. It'll only make the national news if it's very big and something significant happens.

That said they allegedlly ignored [this protest last year](https://tompride.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/bbc-and-press-ignore-massive-demonstration-against-austerity-in-london/), only [they didn't](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-27962963) at all. In fact that march was also reported in the Guardian, Telegraph, and the Independent.

People on the right and the left always claim the BBC is biased against them, if they can't show intentional bias, then its biased by failure to report, or failure to give the story or story angle they see as important enough attention.

IMO it's mostly the bias of the person complaining showing, not the BBC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> - UKIP received 4,376,635 votes at the Euro Elections in 2014, a national scale election, but received 3,881,099 at the general election - a *loss* of 495,536 voters.

- In Thanet Farage received 16,026 votes, Thanet North and Thanet South together cast 28,123 votes for UKIP, but virtually the same area elected a UKIP council with 54,230 votes.

- UKIP was polling at 17% in January but only received 12.6% of the vote.

- UKIP didn't get a poll bounce from the leaders debate, and actually dropped in the polls immediately after the challengers debate.

- UKIP performed poorly in all 12 of its top target seats and was beaten into *third* by Labour in half of them.

- It actually *lost* vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 and 2014 performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester   Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%

In other words Farage isn't nearly as good of a campaigner as people think, and the major UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler (who paid for the campaign) was correct when he described the election as "a failure". This is the reason why there was a leadership coup following Farage's un-resignation. </TEXT>

We have two years of this nonsense to look forward to and the public are already exhausted by the clap trap spewing forth over the issue.

* UKIPs main donors 2001 - 2013 (total, of which less than two million came from other sources, 9,554,314): Paul Sykes, Stuart Wheeler, Julian Blackwell, Sir John Craven, Lord Neidpath, Viscount Michael Cowdray, Lady Yvonne Vinson, Lady Yvonne Collin, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Clare Barbour, John Malcolm Richards, Christopher Mills, Robin Birley, Crispin Odey, and Andy Brough. This is basically a list of bankers, brokers and the landed gentry - all of whom are seeking UKIP Peerages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you need to read the article and the quote. Wheeler described the campaign as "a failure" in an interview, which I've linked to, in The Times immediately after the election. Patrick OFlynn launched an extraordinary personal attack on Farage at the same time - both over the poor execution of the campaign. Pretending this didn't happen or that Wheeler or O'Flynn don't fit the description of a senior members of UKIP is simply ridiculous.

We're taking the GE as a baseline for two reasons firstly its a comparable national scale election, secondly just about every UKIP shipper on this sub has claimed that the Euro elections were a predictor of UKIP's performance in the GE - they're right. 

Labour's performance in the EU election made it look much more competitive in the GE than was the case. The only pluses from the Labour perspective is that it took every Lab/Con marginal, and the 7 most marginal Tory seats were decided collectively by 900 votes. The very most marginal seat went blue by only 47 votes! The next 20 most marginal seats were collectively decided by less than 10,000 votes. That means the Tories are highly vulnerable - Labour or the LibDems could easily call a by-election in a marginal they hold at the right time and sell it as a referendum on Cameron's leadership.

The whole GE was a great deal closer to a coalition than it looked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stuart Wheeler is a *very* senior member of the party, one of its longest members, and its largest donor - the UKIP equivalent of Lord Ashcroft. Patrick OFlynn was your campaign director - there are no two people in the party more senior save for Farage himself.

You're under the impression I'm criticising the party or its platform - in actual fact i'm offering an analysis of the result from an electoral standpoint - whine about the electoral system if it makes you feel better but the system we have is the system we have and UKIP must play that game. 

The purpose of an election campaign is to convince voters to vote for you taking the euro election as a baseline UKIP actually lost votes, seats, and saw a 5% drop in national support.

<TEXT> Well, obviously you won't accept any criticism of what you perceive to be a major victory and confirmation that your position is well supported and valid. But the electoral truth is somewhat different, UKIP could have scored up to 10 seats, should have in fact looking at the tabs on the exit polls. There were back channel discussions with the Tories on this basis alone.

UKIP left the election red-faced and more importantly powerless.

But when one of your [party's major donors levels](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4440215.ece) an accusation like that at the leader's closest aide and calls for Farage to [face a leadership election](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership) because he fluffed the campaign, you would do better to listen rather than reject out of hand.

Edit: The paywalled Times interview above is the one in which Wheeler called the campaign a failure. Wheeler has donated close to 1 million to UKIP meaning he is solely responsible for 1/7th of the party's income since 2012. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kassams detractors accused him of being a divisive Iago-type figure, dripping rightwing poison into Farages ear that harmed the partys chances of winning over moderate voters.

The accusation inside the party mostly exposed in the leadership contra temps post election was that Kassam pushed Farage too far to the right because he wanted a Tea Party Style campaign and this is what cost them the votes they needed to win seats.

Its been very easy for party supporters to blame the electoral system and focus on the national vote (UKIP after all loves grievance), but when you look at UKIP's performance during the campaign there is no doubt that the campaign cost UKIP votes - the polls show that.

UKIP lost a seat it had and should have won, failed in 9 other seats, lost 600k voters who were willing to vote UKIP (the hardest part is getting people to change their vote), and Carswell having received 59% of the vote in 2014 was elected with only 44%.

Thats the internal discussion inside the party - not the national performance, because the national performance doesn't matter in FPTP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What she was alluding to was power structure and privilege - the currency of distribution and decision making rather than overt racism or gender discrimination. The two are very often confused, but also often intertwined.

I'll give you a real world example this goes back to the 80s. 

My father belonged to a village golf club near the large town I grew up in. The golf club wasn't open to female members unless signed in by male players and there were no BME members despite the nearby town being highly diverse. It was in modern terms actually sexist and functionally racist even if the latter was only partially intentional.

My father was not wealthy, upper class, nor were the other club members, but his job involved the distribution of public money into building projects. All the work went to other club members, while deals were not done on the golf course the relationships that drove the decisions were made there and only there. The councillors who made decisions on projects were members too - all very cozy - not actually nor intentionally corrupt but functionally so.

Over 30 years that meant that enough public money to build around a quarter of a million housing units went to the denizens of one very small village golf club and seven or eight businesses located nearby. Those relationships persisted for more than a quarter of a century. That was just the way things were, and are, done. 

Basically there was a privileged power structure around the club which was both racist and sexist in some form and completely exclusionary.

This wasn't some well known gentlemen's club for the super rich, or a parliamentary cabal controlling the country, it was simply how things were done everywhere. The vestiges of that power structure remain - they are far less overt in the 21st century but they absolutely exist.

In short form all she did in a professional context was make a poor choice of words on a university twitter account 'white trash' which she admits was wrong, and ask white people not to attend a meeting specifically BME women. There were some additional tweets, but those were on a personal account, unconnected to her work and are indeed how that community expresses itself.

<TEXT> That's a straw man argument you've constructed around what *you* think her job is. As a white male I'm not offended nor am I injured by being *asked politely* not to attend an event specifically designed for BME women, its actually a very reasonable request.

As to her comments in the video response she's completely correct - it's a highly academic view and few will understand it expressed in the way it was, but it is accurate. In my society I am not robbed of opportunity by my race or gender - many people are and without good reason. Many right wingers will argue that isn't the case because of positive discrimination and what they see as reverse racism, but they don't exist in a society where the appearance of their name on a CV causes it to be removed from consideration, nor do they exist in world where there is debate over the validity of their Englishness because their parents were immigrants or they were born into a given religion. What most right wingers complain of is actually perceived loss of power.

His job is to teach and mentor. Half his student body is female, as are many members of staff and colleagues on his advisory panels. Expressing this opinion is utterly disabling to that work and basically means he can't do that work without concerns over his partiality. </TEXT>

Had, as he now claims, his remarks been intended in a jocular, ironic way, one would imagine he was attempting to start a discussion over the role of women in science. Instead he dismissed the contribution of his female students and colleagues summarily and now complains that he has been dismissed equally summarily, even going so far as to suggest labs should be segregated. </TEXT>

Nobody raised an eyebrow over the countless people the Daily Mail or the News of the World did this to - celebrities, we are told, deserve it because they have 'chosen' to be public figures.

<TEXT> Its funny that the more people know about what's actually happening with the car the less happy they are with the racing.

Pretty much all of these arguments were deployed each time we've had a major engine shift since the 90s - I heard some of the complaints made in the first turbo era! The whole point of shifting the technology platform *is* to slow the cars down. The speed always comes back. 

Yes, the racing has become dull, especially this year, but its simply a need for closer racing. 

In the 80s and 90s everyone was going nuts because engines lasted 5 minutes and the cars were held together with tape. Now everyone is getting upset because the engines and cars do last. Having whinged endlessly because hard tyres made dull races, fans apparently want them back. The same goes for refueling and whole host of other things. 

The world and its wife is wishing mortality would catch up with Bernie whilst lionising the age when he did actually have full control of the sport - in this era the teams are in charge but the problems are all Bernie it seems. 

Everything old really is new again!

Murray Walker talking about the 1986 Spanish Grand Prix in 2013:-

It was a race that was all about fuel management and tyre wear - don't let anyone tell you that the current era is the first in which drivers have had to take care of their cars during a grand prix! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given the only budget areas not affected by Osborne's latest cuts will be Education, Health and International Development the plan seems to be to cut so hard and so deep everywhere that no one knows what the hell is happening. 

The plan, such as it is, appears to be the Teapartynomics pioneered by Bobby Jindal in Louisiana and Sam Brownback in Kansas - ultra low taxation and spending on the grounds that allowing the super rich more wealth means they will invest more. It has unsurprisingly failed spectacularly and killed growth stone dead. 

Interestingly Kansas actually has a law requiring a balanced budget, similar in nature to Osborne's blatantly political Mansion House idea. 

I grow more concerned with the policy ideas of the atlanticist faction of the Tory party each day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the system but under most forms of PR UKIP would have gained 80 or so MP's and the SNP 30. You can argue about the electorate, but ultimately 35% of the UK electorate *chose* not to vote including  29% of the Scottish electorate, despite the stakes involved. The gap between the yes vote and the general election vote is more credibly explained by lower turnout and a divided vote among the Unionist parties.

The fact remains that the SNP would *still* have a majority in Scotland in any Westminster system you choose, and the Scottish Parliament elections yielded a similar result to the GE even under PR. My libertarian friends would describe that as the tyranny of the majority (I think they're nuts) but that's where it is.

If you take the Indyref and general election results together with one eye on the manifestos then Scottish voters voted for either DevoMax or Home Rule - certainly the latter is what is being sought by the SNP and the polling on independence since Indyref shows a narrow majority in favor of separation. No credible observer of politics doubts there will be another referendum in the next decade, but the SNP need to build a credible fiscal case and solve the EU membership issue. My bet is they will seek a federal setup and then argue for independent membership of the EU.

You can't sit there and ignore the size of the victory based on a felicitous argument about PR whilst pointing at the 29% of Scottish voters that gave up a say in the matter as if that proves something.

Personally I favor PR with mandatory voting and a none of the above option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, in actual fact you're the one choosing the goal posts. Since your original point was that the FPTP is easy and that's why the SNP won - you've since gone on to argue that FPTP is easy for the SNP and difficult for UKIP. 

My point was that the Scottish result is a massive achievement - a landslide victory for the SNP in every possible way. If you really wish to contrast the two the SNP removed a manifesto commitment it has had for 20 years and moved to home rule agenda driven by the result of the referendum. UKIP moved further right than it ought to have (according to their own people) and, riven by internal schisms, failed in 9 places where it had a very decent shot at victory. In essence, buoyed by fleeting successes, it tried to compete everywhere and split its focus. Basically UKIP tried to run before it could walk and would have done much better had it pursued the SNP's more focussed strategy over the last 5/10 years.

You also can't argue that the SNP benefited from the referendum and not acknowledge that UKIP benefited from the Euro elections and two by-elections in a similar fashion.

The SNP has sought PR throughout its history, UKIP having had a campaign failure, has suddenly seen the light on PR and I have little sympathy for its position for that reason.

Clacton wise Carswell had 53.0% of the vote in 2010, 59% in 2014, and *fell* to 44.5% in 2015 - still a massive result, but it has a great deal more to do with Carswell being a trusted MP than it does UKIP policy, given that UKIP had no national manifesto at the time. Indeed Carswell, having failed to become UKIP leader seems poised to leave the party. </TEXT>

As a result of the Tory and UKIP position at the last election Labour would need at 10% uniform swing to gain office, just as the Tories have complained of bias because the collective strength of Labour and the Lib Dems has meant they would need a similarly large swing to gain a serious majority.

The employment market is recovering but at the bottom end not the top end, which is affecting treasury receipts. More minimum wage jobs are being created than well paid jobs, and youth and graduate employment remains disasterous.

Borrowing is up, spending is up, debt is up, growth is down, the wrong kind of jobs are appearing. I can't think of a single one of his promises he's actually kept to! I don't see how you can possibly claim that Osborne is either well regarded or vindicated. </TEXT>

All major housing developments have a social housing component and to make that affordable for developers each receives some form of government assistance (profitability and cashflow on development is narrower than people think).

This is one of the many reasons government spending isn't like household accounts - if your home stops spending at Tescos you don't have to worry about Tesco going under. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically Balls was correct - Osborne cut spending, particularly infrastructure spending, too quickly in 2010 which tanked the construction sector and nearly tipped us into a second recession. He spent 2011 and 2012 backpedaling and the consequent rise in the deficit and spending hurt his targets badly. The 2013 credit rating downgrade caused a further rise in debt interest - these were among the reasons that he couldn't meet his deficit reduction targets. 'Plan A' went out the window very quickly indeed despite his rhetoric to the contrary.

The downgrade in outlook is really a warning that the UK is very poorly placed to absorb any economic shocks, and a Brexit would be a giant economic shock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wiping out the [deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Sector_Net_Cash_Requirement), officially known as the  Public Sector Net Cash Requirement, isn't the same thing as wiping out government debt - [debt vs deficit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25944653). Osborne intends to wipe out the former (around 80 billion) but won't be able to do much with the latter (1.36 trillion). 

Removing the deficit brings down the interest paid on the debt. The economic discussion is about how fast you can do this without destroying parts of the economy because that affects growth (low or negative growth increases the deficit). For reference government spending is around 46% of the economy down from 55% in 2010.

The credit rating applies to government debt bonds, if the rating falls too low then banks are not allowed to invest in them and it also directly affects the value of the interest we pay on the debt which is currently accruing at 2 billion a week thanks to the deficit - the lower the rating the greater the interest. There is a decent explanation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating).

This is very bad news as it indicates low confidence in the financial stability of the UK and its ability to meet its obligations. </TEXT>

You can fiddle with it a little, I'd much prefer an evidence based approach, but it's simply too controversial. Just look at the debate on prison reform. We can reduce recidivism by 90% with proper community based sentencing for non-violent offences, but the public don't want to hear it and the debate takes place over rapists and murderers just as the drugs debate focusses on dead teenagers, gangs, and evil drug lords.

For the LD's and Greens who have absolutely no influence on major policy its the easiest commitment in the world because there is no chance of their implementing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can blame the main parties all you want to but the reality is it's [50/50 or very close to that](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/06/16/drugs-policies-dont-work/) across most public polling on the subject - which basically makes it a lose-lose issue. Until public opinion on the whole canon of drugs policy moves beyond 60% in regular polling governments won't touch it. 

Regular polling on Gay marriage hit the tipping point at around that mark. Drugs are well on their way to an evidence based approach after the 2020 general election thankfully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Only* 50% really? 

We haven't had a national government with more than 41% of the vote since Major - according to the commentary three of the victories since 1992 were landslides and they had at most an 8% swing, 30% is unprecedented. The last time a national election turned out a 50%+ result was Stanley Baldwin in 1923.

The SNP discovered that talk of independence or another referendum were indeed a turn off for voters and removed it from their manifesto, they were given a mandate instead to fight for greater fiscal autonomy, their manifesto commitments essentially add up to home rule.

As I said earlier the Indyref and general election result taken together with the independence polling since the referendum appear to be a rejection of the timing and the plan for independence, but an endorsement of the idea and of moving in that direction and attempting to answer the key fiscal questions whilst resolving the EU membership debate. I would be very surprised if the SNP don't attempt to move for independent membership of the EU during this parliament.

The SNP are already moving toward fiscal autonomy, and the national government will either be forced into a federal approach or Scotland will move toward independence once there is greater evidence of Scottish national solvency. Any way you examine the outcomes it is a vote for independence or effective independence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They achieved a 30% swing and took 50% of the Scottish vote with 1,454,436 - double the vote share of Labour and fully half of the electorate on 71.1% turnout. In any electoral system thats a landslide. 

Personally I favour PR but you can't sit there and pretend this wasn't a landslide and a clear statement of intent from the Scottish Electorate. If there is a majority in Scotland for the Union it's an extremely narrow one 50/50 at best. Were the voting trends we've seen since 1997 to continue there will be independence in a decade or less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps unionist voters stayed at home, but if they did it would have to have been in small numbers, some Scottish seats saw 80% turnout! I really think you can't look at the Indyref and general election results together and not see them as a vote for home rule and eventual independence. The result also matches a trend in SP elections that has been going on since the first Lab/Lib coalition post 1997 - declining unionist votes.

Even looking upon what the unionist parties have to offer Scotland kindly I can't see a resurgence for them in Scotland without a very big screw up from the SNP that forces the electorate to look elsewhere for leadership. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The argument (as its made in this sub and elsewhere) is that Scotland receives more money from Westminster via the Barnett formula than Wales or Northern Ireland and therefore is well off. England is, in essence, a generous parent and Scotland should be happy with what it has because it couldn't do better on its own. It is as patronising and paternalistic of an argument against independence as exists.

The point of the remaining statement, as is quite obvious (because that's what the barnett formula pays for), is to serve as an example of why the basic infrastructure required in Scotland is quite different to that required in the majority of England.

<TEXT> Its rather like the Eurosceptics that argue that we must repatriate powers from Brussels. Ask them what powers and the response is "all of them", ask what problems this causes the UK and the response is "big ones" or "we must free ourselves from the EUSSR" - its a definition free debate.

So Cameron has said he wants treaty reform, but hasn't defined what that looks like (same situation for Thatcher and Major), allowing him to get what he can and either claim its the path to treaty reform which is a slow process, or claim that this is the best deal we could get, and declare victory. My bet is the latter.

Arguably this is what Thatcher did with the rebate and Major did with the Social Policy exemption. Thatcher regretted her decision and 1970s support by the end of her premiership.

Ultimately we want the trade and military support without the federalism and don't see that as a lack of reciprocity - just a recent surveys have suggested the British want free access to Europe without Europe having free access to the UK. Its a very tiresome position. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is exactly what led to the FOCA/FISA war, the rise of Bernie from team owner to leader of the sport, and the invention of the modern FIA.

What the teams wanted was a team led sport, they got it, could not agree on anything and so left it to Bernie. 

The teams wanted control again in the early 2010s and that led to RedBull effectively ending FOTA, the creation of the F1 strategy group, the current financial settlement, and the present demands to leave it to Bernie again.

Past is prologue, especially in F1.

Bernie will give you exactly what you want and merrily watch it burn down around you whilst playing both ends against the middle. The object lesson being be careful what you wish for - you might just get it.

<TEXT> For the reasons stated above - in all the permutations of voting systems the Tories won the last election in terms of seats. However 7 of those seats are based on only 900 voters, the next 20 marginals less than 10,000. Their win is razor thin and they know it - 10,900 voters actually decided a Tory majority rather than a coalition.

They may actually need the additional votes nationally to count going forward. If the LibDems were to improve in only 2 seats, and UKIP in 5 and Labour 5 their majority is gone. Electoral reform might actually offer a hedge against UKIP depending on the system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the Tories are about an inch away from going for electoral reform themselves. What the Tories like to call the 'bias' in the FPTP electoral system - two strong left of centre parties meaning they would need an unlikely swing to win - has now reversed with the collapse of the LibDems and the rise of UKIP. 

The implementation of boundary commission's review is now not so attractive as it would create new and uncertain marginals and cost them 8 of their 12 seat majority at a stroke.

The inherent risk in the referendum is that it shatters the internal Tory coalition and does for UKIP what the IndyRef did for the SNP - creates a 'neverendum' situation with the added perils of defections to UKIP. 

The only way they might cling on were UKIP to become stronger is something like STV. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the USA, Canada, and Australia illegal immigration is the serious problem. While we also have an illegals problem it's nowhere near as big as it is there. But we realise that interrupting commerce with draconian searches is a much more costly problem than the immigration.

We already have a points based system, it's based on the Australian system with the addition of tiering, and it works well - it's just a byzantine nightmare to navigate and it's very expensive to the user.   

Cameron's embarrassment is twofold - you can't crack down on non-eu immigration (which is the largest part) without hurting the economy, and open borders is a red line for the rest of the EU even though in many respects they have a larger problem with immigration than the UK does.

The bigger problem, from my perspective, with the amount of oxygen the ludicrous debate on immigration is sucking up is that the global economy is weak, the banks are far from under control, and if the pattern holds we are three to five years from another recession. 

Wasting time on a referendum and its attendant crowing will do nothing but put off businesses investment and allow the tories to ignore the economy whilst tearing the hair out in public. </TEXT>

If you could get it into a period along with several other big events, Pride for example and the Hyde Park concert series, Formula E, and maybe resurrect the British Empire Trophy as an LMP race, all while sharing logistic support, routes and facilities there could be a way. Having it around the British Grand Prix weekend would also cut shipping costs.

I've often thought staging the European Grand Prix as a series of events on road courses and moving from one capital city to the next - London - Paris - Madrid - Berlin - each year so the cost isn't entirely on one city might work. There are promoters who would take it on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And yet their system often prioritizes unskilled workers - and the fact remains that the points system is only one of several systems!

The second study was one I mentioned, from the UKBA Migration Watch Committee because it's conclusion is complimentary but focusses on only A8 data. If you actually read the study rather than the hyperbolic press reports it too concludes that:-

We find no association between working-age migrants and native employment: (i) in buoyant economic times; (ii) for EU migrants; (iii) for the period 1975-1994. By contrast, we find a negative association between working-age migrants and native employment: (i) in depressed economic times; (ii) for non-EU migrants; (iii) for the period 1995-2010.

So outside of recessionary periods (Q2 2008 - Q2 2009) when there is positive growth there is no link, and looking at the wider dataset, as the first report does rather than just considering A8 data, there is also no link.

Youth unemployment has been a problem for some time - especially since the credit crunch struck in the mid 2000s. Looking at the geographic data it's mainly focussed in inner cities where educational attainment is poor. The shadow economy is also a factor - those employed in illegal enterprises still show up in the figures along with gap year students and young people working in the voluntary sector or caring for relatives.

Companies are less willing to train staff, less willing to hire younger people, and often have young people working in internships who are entirely supported by the benefits system or the bank of mum and dad. Public sector job cuts also disproportionately affect young people as the public sector is more willing to hire the young.

My good friends daughter was forced to work through four years of unpaid full-time internships prior to finding a job, another friend's daughter went for one of this government's much vaunted apprenticeships only to discover it was a complete con and she was stuck as the tea girl for a year both received JSA and were classed as unemployed throughout.

The reality is the majority of young people with good educational attainment are not competing for the same jobs as migrants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My original claim was that the ''Australian' style system actually prioritizes many professions that UKIP considers to be unskilled and unworthy.' The points system doesn't consider skilled or unskilled it simply prioritises the professions the economy needs more of to expand and fast-tracks those, there is also a secondary general immigration system in place that takes 18 - 24 months to complete, and a third system dealing with de-facto partners and family. At the moment you'll get very high points if you're a general labourer or hairdresser because those are in demand.

Your point was that 'Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers, not just to make up the numbers.' And that simply isn't the case - skills are not the issue, demand is, and you can still immigrate fairly easily anyway.

Odd that the highest periods of youth unemployment were between 1992 and 1998 and between 2008 and now. Quite how a quote on Labour's early 2000s immigration policy supports your argument on youth unemployment is as mystifying as your *highly* dated view of what working class is.

The Major report on the subject by National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is entitled Examining the relationship between immigration and unemployment using National Insurance Number registration data.

It concluded:

Our results seem to confirm the lack of impact of migration on unemployment in aggregate. We find no association between migrant inflows and claimant unemployment.

Overall therefore, our results indicate a lack of any significant correlation between migrant inflows and changes aggregate claimant count rates, in line with the general message emerging from previous research that migration has had generally negligible effect on unemployment rates.

In fact studies by The Borders Agency Migration Advisory Committee, NIESR, and a review of the data by Oxford Universitys Migration Observatory all found no significant link between immigration and youth unemployment or employment in general. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You very much mis-understand the post war landscape and economy based your commentary. Especially the Blitz, London was the worst hit city with over a million homes destroyed, but that amounted to less than 10% of the housing stock, in Coventry only 2,306 houses were destroyed and all of that had been rebuilt or replaced by the end of the war - not in the post war years. 

Given your quote on points based systems "Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers" you have been proved wrong - the point of a points based system is to focus on the economies *needs*, not to differentiate between skilled and unskilled. 

Youth unemployment is always high after a recession, it has zero to with immigration. Kippers do love to have it both ways - we're allegedly awash with unskilled migrants and they're competing with educated British youngsters for the same jobs. Hmm. No serious research substantiates this and no serious economic thinker believes it - the same thing happened post 1992

<TEXT> Yes a great deal of people had been killed in the war, but we still had to embark on the largest national housebuilding programme ever completed to accommodate the returning troops, refugees, and foreign troops that fought with us - in excess of 1.5 million European people including 180,000 of the 500,000 German POWs who chose to stay despite being used a slave labour after the war.

But the fact remains that we had 16 working people for every pensioner in the UK in 1948, by 2000 that number had shrunk to just 2. Far from 'maintaining industrial productivity' we were desperately trying to rebuild industry of all types - everything had been repurposed for the war and the country was virtually bankrupt.

Right now our working age population is 32.7m out of an estimated population of 63.7m, fully one half of the population are financially supporting the other half.

Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers, not just to make up the numbers.

Points based systems are in fact designed to flex with the needs of the economy for almost all of the 2000s Australia's most sought after skills in the points catalog were hairdressers and general labourers. Since the majority of net migration is non-eu and our system is already points based that would suggest that UKIPs assumptions about the needs of the economy are somewhat out of step with reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our birth rate had sunk so low that we were a decade away from population shrinkage, and our pensions (75% of the welfare budget) had become perilously unaffordable. We needed more working age people between 25 and 45, there is only one way to achieve that.

Filling the population gap with immigrants is exactly what the 'Australian' points based immigration system was designed to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably around the time Farage stops dismissing losing manifestos as drivel, and stops making NHS policy, and other policy on the hoof.

But UKIP does have ideological ground based on its recent manifesto - authoritarian, statist, neoliberal-ultranationalist-conservatism.

Actually what bothers me about the UKIP manifesto is the ignorance of it. We already have in place a points based immigration system based on the Australian one and we have had since 2008, all non-eu migrants on a 3 month or longer non-tourist visa already pay a 200 annual fee for health insurance prior to entering the country, in addition to being required to have travel insurance with repatriation and medical expenses cover. Those from the EU are covered by a reciprocal system - presumably Farage is aware of this as thats how he's covered when working in the EU. 

Apparently UKIP is seeking this 'Australian' style system, even though a whopping 23% of Australia's population is foreign born and their system actually prioritizes many professions that UKIP considers to be unskilled and unworthy of in work qualifications like hairdressers, general labourers, stable hands, and horse groomers.

The list of policies in the UKIP manifesto that are already in place is actually very long indeed. Having read the document it seems to be entirely based on what UKIP supporters think is happening in the country as opposed to what is actually happening.

In general UKIP places, morally, what the UK taxpayer pays for, what UKIP considers to be foreign citizens, above what EU governments pay for our citizens, even though the number of UK citizens claiming benefits in the EU outnumbers the amount of EU citizens claiming benefits here and our system is less generous. The party also gives not a moment of thought to the stresses placed on EU government systems by the 2.1 million UK nationals living in the EU even though 400,000 of those people are pensioners and the population we've acquired in return is 98% of working age, but lionises the alleged stresses placed on our systems by migrants. In other words UKIP likes to present itself as a party of fairness, balance, and reciprocity for work but is nothing of the sort.

Its also deeply amusing to me that under UKIP's manifesto if Boris Johnson or Daniel Hannan were prosecuted for speeding they would be deported - both being foreign born citizens - no matter their immigration status.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should have added 'fear' - it seems to be the strongest motivator for UKIP supporters. Just exactly what are you afraid of?

There are 2.34 million EU Nationals living in the UK, and 2.1 million British citizens in the EU (400,000 of which are pensioners). Our age dependency ratio has finally recovered to a point where we can actually afford our pensioners and that wasn't the case in 2000 when we had two working people for 1 pensioner (in 1948 we had 16).

Of the UK citizenry as a whole 11.9% are foreign born (a group that includes Daniel Hannan and Boris Johnson). That's a lower percentage than the USA, Canada or Australia.

UKIP supporters keep jumping up and down and claiming the world is on fire and the surest sign of that is apparently immigration, not the state of the global economy. Frankly the gut-wrenching small mindedness of the party's platform as a whole makes me weep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What he actually said was:-

"motivated to some extent by racism," while others voted for UKIP out of "despair," believing they were "some kind of anti-establishment party".

Having debated with UKIP supporters for some time both of these statements are entirely accurate. Many of the UKIP supporters I've spoken with fixate on the notion that someone, in essence 'less deserving, is getting something they're not. It often appears that the heart of their arguments is an unfocused feeling of loss of power.

Many UKIP supporters - particularly those on the DT - refer to 'The Establishment' in a negative context and claim their party is funded by its membership. They're often upset to discover that the party's major donors are all members of 'The Establishment' and all donate to 'LibLabCon' - you might be forgiven for thinking that those donors are only after a peerage.

<TEXT> I think if he's consistently qualifying the car below its potential and not challenging Seb regularly in the next few races then Ferrari will give more serious thought than they appear to have at present to replacing him this year. 

Personally I believe they already wanted to replace him at the end of this season, but it depends who they want to go with next, and what's in the way in terms of that driver's contract (Seb is also a consideration). Bianchi obviously put a crimp in their long term plan.

If he can't get his qualifying sorted out then, were I Ferrari, i'd go find a younger driver with good speed and hire them on a short contract. Hulkenberg has the speed, Ricciardo or Bottas would make excellent long term replacements. 

If they wait a year Rosberg would be out of contract (it's *so* hard to challenge Lewis in the same machinery - I wonder if he's sending a message), and Verstappen or Sainz might be ready for the big time - both have been very impressive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is that other drivers could deliver more in that seat than Kimi has this year and do so more reliably - Ferrari drivers generally leave the team when there is a large gap to their teammate. 

Massa for example was consistently earning points, but placing 6th in the WDC when Alonso was turning in 2nds or 3rds. Kimi's situation isn't that bad yet, but it is moving in that direction, and his qualifying is a serious problem - it might easily make the difference between 2nd in the WCC and 3rd. 

So the question is twofold - Is he justifying his salary, and is he helping the team more than hurting them? Right now Ferrari could acquire a driver with more potential on vastly less money and still achieve the same or better results.

Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of Kimi's, I'm not saying he's a bad driver. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hamilton on Vettel in 2012:

"I think hes a true champion," 

"Hes polite, hes never in trouble, hes squeaky clean and a genuinely nice guy. He speaks incredibly well and carries himself really well. And at the end of the day you have to do the job even if you do have the best car."

The most dominant car/driver combos in F1 history are (in order of percentage of victories in a season):-

- Ascari's 1953 Ferrari 500 (75%); 

- Schumacher's 2004 F2004 (72%); 

- Jim Clark's 1963 Lotus 25 (70%);

- Vettel's 2013 RB9 (68%);

- Fangio's 1954 Maserati 250F A6GCM (66%);

- Schumacher's 2002 F2002 (64%);

- Jim Clark's 1965 Lotus 33 (60%);

- Vettel's 2011 RB7 and Hamilton's 2014 W05 (57.89%);

- Fangio's 1955 Mercedes W196 (57.18%).

So right now he's tied for 8th on the all time dominance list with Vettel. The distribution of those dates says quite a bit about the history of the sport. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a more complicated calculation than 'is he delivering on track' - he's a great driver no question, but is he delivering results and experience at Williams another driver couldn't? Not really.

Williams (have said publicly, indeed Massa himself has said publicly) that they've hit the point where money is more of a drag on the team than driver experience.

Massa is also 34 and at the end of a three year deal, from his point of view he remains marketable in other series with his current results (but knows that won't hold forever), from the team's point of view they could hire a driver on a third of his salary and still deliver the results they're getting. So it might be good timing for both to part ways.

Younger drivers also tend to come with sponsors that could help the team (I don't mean pay drivers), and are generally more attractive to sponsors. Its equally possible Mercedes might cut them a sweetheart deal on engines to take a Merc young driver - they're making a play for Verstappen. </TEXT>

Every time Rosberg says it's hard to race Lewis in the same machinery I wonder if he's telegraphing a message to Ferrari. If they did keep Kimi for another year Rosberg would be out of contract at the same time that they would be looking for a replacement. 

Really unlikely though, as you say. </TEXT>

But it's possible for them to make a calculation and take in a youngster now who has potential, or a cheaper driver that could produce reliable results without challenging Seb.

When you consider Kimi is on $26 million a year including bonuses, Rosberg on $14.8 million and Hulkenberg is on $4 million and Bottas $1.1 million there are considerable savings to be had. 

Might be fun for Ferrari to make a play for Rosberg!! </TEXT>

That spin allowed Bottas within 20 points of him in WDC, which is a big deal (as you say though, not 100% his fault, but it does beg a question).

Equally Ferrari could hire Bottas, Hulkenberg, Ricciardo or Button and likely achieve more reliable results for less money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look none of what you've had to say so far is at all correct - especially what you've written above. I strongly urge you to read up on the *actual* history of the sport, especially the concorde agreement, the formation of FOCA and the FOCA/FISA war, again.

You'll note this year that FOM has launched a social media effort, which is actually pretty good. What you don't appear to have understood at all the complexity of the commercial rights behind it. The point Bernie was making last year - was that social media, while desirable, is expensive to implement, staff, and isn't going to make the teams the kind of money necessary to enhance the sport and it is therefore very low down on the order of priority for FOM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think anyone is really arguing that people should be forced to do things they are uncomfortable with. After all the fundamental of the LGBQT marriage debate is that people who disagree with LGBQT marriage don't have the right to force that opinion on other people's lives through the state or the church.

But if you're not a gay friendly business then you *should* advertise that fact to avoid embarrassment for both parties - but bakeries, just like B B's, don't want to advertise that they're not LGBQT friendly because it might hurt their business.

Therein lies the rub - those unfriendly to the LGBQT community are well aware that their views are outside the mainstream and that once this becomes known it could damage their business even amongst the straight community. Not only that but several of the bakeries have said that they have no problem with LGBQT customers, they just object to wedding cakes - that is a perilous line to tread - your money is only good for some purchases, but we won't tell you that unless you ask.

A little over a generation ago people were refused service by churches and many wedding businesses because they were divorcees seeking marriage - interestingly that was treated as an absolute wrong and the debate surrounding it was a lot less angry than this one even though the fundamental issue is identical. </TEXT>

Totally agree though I'm not questioning Verstappen's natural talent, but he'll struggle to get anywhere with the attitude he's been displaying, just as a certain Spaniard has. Many have pointed to this attitude being displayed by other champions - but they had established themselves first.

He made it from a driver to team owner to the de facto leader of the sport. No one else in professional sports has been able to achieve that while managing the complex politics surrounding sports management, which is why no one else has a comparable record.

Bernie became powerful because he's very good at what he does and that makes his record all the more impressive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From a recent [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2015/05/31/f1-revenue-accelerates-past-fifas-to-16-2-billion/) article:

Research by the Express newspaper last year revealed that Mr Ecclestone has signed deals worth an estimated $23.4 billion in the 30 years since he took over the helm of F1. It is understood to be more than any other individual in the history of professional sport has raised.

Pretty impressive record

Mr Ecclestone is directly in charge of bringing in new business across all of F1s major revenue streams. The sport has no chief marketing officer, no press officer and not even a deputy chief executive or successor for its 84 year-old boss. He says he has no intention of retiring and whilst he is delivering these kind of results it is little surprise that CVC too doesn't want him to give up the wheel.

You won't replace Bernie with one person. There simply isn't anyone who could do what Bernie does at the level he does it, and across the different disciplines involved. The board would restructure FOM into a more modern business with separate people in charge of the major revenue streams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can pay Now TV (which are a Sky brand) 6.99 for a one day pass or 9.99 for a week pass and have the high quality stream in the UK. It's pretty good and honestly its both cheaper and better than having the full Sky package.

The problem is the way rights are negotiated both historically and currently with national level broadcasters by region on ten year contracts - this type of licensing runs across many sports and is in general 'the way things are done' in the industry.

If you wanted a centralized streaming solution then FOM would have to come to an agreement with *every* regional broadcaster over a licensing fee on the pictures (because they've already licenced them from FOM), and another separate agreement over the commentary (the IP for which is their property of the broadcaster), and a third over how and when the revenue is distributed. 

You could negotiate for FOM to hold the streaming rights exclusively, but FOM then wouldn't fetch a good price on the rights, and it would lower the quality of the TV shows because, as a business, the broadcaster will have to start to question the value of shipping a team of 30+ people around the world to every race in order to produce a show that it realises little or no cash flow from.

Achieving a global streaming deal would be a hugely complex effort and take years of negotiations - not only that but a centralised solution isn't necessarily in the financial interests of FOM or the regional broadcasters both of whom are buying the rights to a product they can repackage and sell at a profit. It may, however, save everyone the costs of producing and marketing their own apps and streaming and that might be attractive in the long run.

The new F1 app broadcasts commentary in multiple languages so I do believe this is the direction they are moving in, but you'll probably have to wait until the each regional contract is renewed for it to happen globally.

$1 a race is completely unrealistic pricing wise though, it wouldn't even cover the production costs of filming the races let alone provide enough revenue for everyone to make money - remember the TV rights make up about $6 - 700 million of the team's prize money - hurting the value of the TV rights directly hurts the teams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm very disappointed in Max's reaction to the crash - he keeps doubling down on the braking claim. He declared on his instagram feed after the race that he believes he was brake tested and that it cost him points he 'deserved'. 

That claim provoked a response from Lotus proving he was wrong and then a response from Grosjean, rightly asking what he would gain from doing it - the answer to which is nothing at all! Especially at Monaco where tiny mistakes plant you in the wall.

Two days after the instagram post he said in an article on his own website.

"After an unlucky pit stop, I was charging through the field, before I got brake tested and had a hard crash into turn 1."

The only reason that this is still an issue is that Max keeps repeating the lunatic claim that he was brake tested - and the fact that no one has talked him down suggests that he's surrounded by 'yes people' and that doesn't bode well for his future.

Hopefully criticism from F1's most experienced driver will hurt in a good way and bring him down to earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To translate some of the figures the article puts Jordan Ford's 2003 budget at around $79 million, in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams today. Minardi was pegged at $46 million ($60 million in 2015 money) and again that's about the budget of a 2015 back of the grid team.

Ferrari were spending $418 million in 2003 (equivalent of $617 million in 2015 or double Mercedes current budget), and they're actually spending around $250 million now.

Overall that suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same, accounting for inflation, rather than climbing as steeply as everyone seems to imagine. In other words the cost reduction efforts have been very successful. </TEXT>

Keke Rosberg almost won what was his last ever F1 race but retired with a delaminating left rear, Mansell just had to keep 3rd to win the WDC having been elevated from 4th by Rosberg's retirement but lost his left rear 2 laps later in spectacular fashion, leaving the WDC to Piquet (the defending champion), or Prost. A precautionary tyre change from Williams left Piquet too far behind and he lost to Prost by 4 seconds having closed 11 seconds of a 15 second gap in the closing stages.

<TEXT> Its got little to do with the regs and everything to do with the driver position in the car - the height of the driver and their seating position affects the weight distribution significantly. /u/Blanchimont has a good summary of what can be [done](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/38dypt/merhi_bemoans_weight_difference_to_f1_teammate/crusb6l).

There are some things that the regs can balance driver weight wise, but its very hard to regulate for driver height not least because you have to alter the car to get the seating position right. Its questionable these days if Webber or Coulthard would make it as far as they did given they're both about the same height as Hulkenberg. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The WDC would remain points decided, just with bonus points awarded, and that would bring it into line with other major competitions like the Six Nations. F1's present system is countback - which also rewards race winners above non-winners but is only used when there is a points tie.

A large chunk of the money teams get is based on their WDC points, the more points you get the more money you get - this would provide a mechanism to achieve that without renegotiating the concorde agreement which will remain in place until 2020.

In any case my point was that one group of people say that x is a problem, those in charge attempt to find a solution that fits within the frameworks in place that solves the problems put forward - at which point the teams fail to agree, put a broken version forward and everyone goes mad. </TEXT>

The failure of the teams to agree on anything is the only real problem the sport has ever had - that was as true in the 1950s as it is today - and the teams should receive a much more critical press than they actually get.

Double points last year was a case in point. Bernie's proposal was for a bonus points system for race wins delivered through medals and double points through the last three races of the season.

The issues that proposal was trying to solve were three fold:-

- That the WDC winner should also have won the most races;

- That the mid-grid teams are struggling financially and more points means more money delivered from FOM; and

- That all but the top three ceasing development late in the season made the racing dull and more points available would incentivise continued development while spicing up the drivers championship.

These are all things widely supported by both fans and the teams, and all big issues.

The Strategy group and the F1 commission (i.e. the teams) could only agree on double points for the last race so thats the broken plan that went ahead - everyone went crazy at Bernie for a decision that wasn't his - and problems were only created not solved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that while RBR were winning everything in sight and were, to an extent, the big financial force in F1 they successfully sought to split FOTA and negotiate directly with FOM - as a result of their political machinations other teams followed suit and the 2013 Concorde agreement was formed. 

A key part of their effort was the fallout from the various trials that Ecclestone went through over the sale of stakes in the commercial rights - I think there were three attempted takeovers a board level - mostly centring on the 15% stake owned by the Lehman estate rather than CVC's controlling interest. My bet is that Mateschitz wanted to acquire that along with another 20% stake which would give him the chairmanship of FOM's board and the controlling interest. Bernie successfully fought off those efforts and CVC retain control at the moment - but I don't think this is where CVC wanted to end up and I don't think they quite know what to do - there is considerable pressure from the teams for them to sell.

At the same time RBR lost a key political battle over the 2014 rules and we're seeing the fallout from that on the track. It appears to me that Mercedes were able to form an alliance with Renault fighting a successful rearguard action to set the direction of the Formula in the interests of the manufacturers. I'd be curious to learn if Honda were involved in the background of all of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think its all very well to criticise Bernie - he takes a lot of flak for decisions made by the teams and direction from CVC - but people fail to consider the alternatives.

In many respects Bernie is F1 - he's the chief deal maker - he has enough clout to bring important people to the table and keep them there and he's a very tough negotiator for the sport. 

Were Bernie to go there isn't anyone in the background that is both a sharp political operator and has the clout to drag people along. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems that neither Torro Rosso or Lotus are interested in selling to Renault (they would be the ideal targets in terms of infrastructure with Sauber as the third option) but Manor would make a lot more sense than entering a new team entirely. 

Lotus and Sauber come with a chunk of debt because Genii and Kaltenborn would want their investments returned at a profit - this makes them less than ideal takeover targets - but makes them interesting investment opportunities.

I've been wondering for a while if Mercedes might leverage its engine deal with Lotus to use them as 'B' team seats for its nascent young driver programme (the fly in that idea being a potential takeover of Lotus by Renault). For all the talk about McLaren and Ferrari 'B' outfits, people seem to have missed Mercedes obvious need for one of their own. They appear to be flirting with Verstappen again, Wehrlein is in the background, as is Ocon, and they can't do anything with them without F1 seats to put them in - as their 2014 attempt to get Verstappen demonstrated.

The timing of the FIA opening up entries seemed interesting. I thought that Renault might seek to enter an entirely new team if they couldn't find an existing team to buy, but going for Manor makes a lot more commercial sense. For all their lack of infrastructure they have an entry, basic facilities and staff, all of which is better than nothing.

If Mercedes invest in Lotus (both of their drivers appear to be out of contract this year), McLaren Honda bring in ART GP, and Renault take over Manor it will make for a very interesting couple of years ahead - this will put RBR under extreme pressure.

I've suspected that the background to the RBR 'exit' talk is their maneuvering for control of the sporting regulations against Mercedes and Renault - both of whom wanted the v6 formula. It appears to me that RBR lost a political fight they felt certain they would win over the 2014 regulations and unable to get the regs they wanted, a works deal with another supplier, or sell the team, they find themselves trapped politically and commercially. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Considering the Tory Majority is built on less than 20,000 votes it would be unwise to completely ignore polling. 7 of those constituencies went blue by, in total, less than 900 votes collectively.

People forget that the polls are +/-5 in margin of error, and that is not so far from the actual result in the recent election. Talking to friends who are normally reliable Labour voters a number switched to the Greens in the polling booth because they had so little confidence in the Labour leadership. </TEXT>

They appear to be flirting with Verstappen again, Wehrlein is in the background, as is Ocon, and they can't do anything with them without F1 seats to put them in.

Renault seem interested in buying Lotus, but the Mercedes deal might prevent that from happening immediately, at all, or mean they take a stake and convert to a works outfit for 2017 or beyond once the Mercedes deal is over. 

If Lotus aren't willing to sell, and nor are Torro Rosso, then the timing of the FIA opening up entries seems interesting. Perhaps Renault might seek to enter an entirely new team - could this be the project Berger is working on?

Grosjean is out of contract at the end of the season, and Maldonado must be close to the end of his having signed in 2013 for one year and then extended for 2015. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Verstappen declared on his instgram feed that he beleives he was [brake tested](https://instagram.com/p/3KKmnkSqjv/) and that cost him points he 'deserved'. That claim provoked a response from [Lotus](https://twitter.com/AlanPermane/status/603518447595737089) and then the response contained in the article linked to above from Grosjean (rightly asking what he would gain from doing it - the answer to which is nothing at all! *Especially* at Monaco where tiny mistakes plant you in the wall).

In the same [article](http://verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht id=2134 lang=en) quoted by you on Verstappen's **own** website, published two days after the instagram feed claim, Verstappen includes the line:
*"After an unlucky pit stop, I was charging through the field, before I got brake tested and had a hard crash into turn 1."*

The only reason that this is still an issue is that Max keeps repeating the lunatic claim that he was brake tested - he doesn't accept that he made an error - which is very concerning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its far from unique in racing series the world over. It's not even unique in F1, Super Aguri were effectively Honda's B team and financed almost entirely by Honda in much the same way as TR until the recession hit. In fact the first three decades of the sport were built on a model where drivers and teams bought their cars from works outfits.

But the reality on the ground is RBR weren't allowed to have TR function as a B team in the way they wanted. They share information, but not designs, mapping, development or day-to-day engineering staff etcetera. They kept the team because the racing seats were worth more to them than the team itself.

RedBull might be very successful (est. value $7.2 billion), but the largest company in F1 are Mercedes-Benz at $22.5 billion, Fiat Chrysler (Ferrari) are worth $20.69 billion. 

To put RedBull's value in perspective Hyundai are actually worth more at $8 billion. </TEXT>

It solved a lot of problems, and has hugely increased the quality of the drivers, but it's not the same as driving an F1 car. </TEXT>

Why does F1 need small teams that are unable to compete on track or be successful enough in the sport to gain investors and stay afloat?

We need teams like HAAS that are prepared to take a patient approach to entry and have a strong underlying business that can benefit from the team's participation whilst supporting the team financially.

All of the successful outfits in the sport have a strong underlying business, all of the teams struggling to stay in don't. There is a reason for that.

137 constructors have participated in the sport since 1950, the average team competes in 20 races for 3 seasons with 5 drivers, wins 0 races, and scores 0 points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very little of what Bernie has done over the years justifies the idea that he's only in this for the money - he's the guy that does the big deals with serious people.

Whilst I don't disagree that it's time for a change, I don't think there is anyone with Bernie's clout or ability in a position to lead the sport, and anyone that has enough political talent to get in won't have the clout or experience to make real change happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say there was some flexibility in that policy. Thanks for the interesting info, I thought he was much closer to the points he needed. In any case my overall point is that they're trying to build a young driver programme and need mid/back of the grid seats to put them in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fifth engine business would allow the extra engine for Friday practice only, but the deal they were seeking on it's wider use would have seen the engine supplier rules relaxed going forward. 

(obv. this is all gossip and supposition) 

The rules relaxation in return for 'something' deal has come up a number of times in separate fights and was on the table during the token fight at the end of last season. Mercedes seem very keen on it, and I can't see who they would have as a customer that they don't have already, so perhaps they're thinking of the future.

Merc paid for Force India's testing so Pascal Wehrlein would be in a position to meet the new superlicence regulations, they were trying to snag [Verstappen](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2014/09/mercedes-pushes-young-driver-programme-pascal-wehrlein-new-f1-reserve-driver/) and Ocon in 2014, and I can't see why they would do that without having seats to put them in (RBR kept VER by bumping him up to TR). 

I've been wondering for a while if they might do a deal with Lotus (Grosjean is out of contract this year, Crashtor is obviously Crashtor) and move their young drivers there on the back of reduced price engines. That would be difficult if Renault are keen for a buyout (unless they take a stake instead and move slowly towards a works team). 

Anyway - all of this together makes be think moves are afoot for a Mercedes B-team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technically. But they appeared to be offering a deal over the fifth engine a few weeks ago that would see that requirement relaxed (Lauda mentioning they were happy to supply the whole grid etc). IMO Mercedes are keen on customer cars, keen to supply more engines, and not too happy with Bernie's leadership... 

Also a Lotus buyout by Renault, [which seems likely](http://www.grandprix247.com/2015/05/28/have-renault-already-bought-lotus/), would leave them room for manuvre in the existing rules, they also compete in DTM with ART GrandPrix. </TEXT>

Renault seem to want a works team by 2017 and if they can't buy TR or Lotus perhaps this is a route they might use.

One of these might be the 'Berger' project Kravitz was hinting at over the Monaco weekend - hopefully something else entirely - could make for an interesting 2016! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Formula One moved around a lot more in Prost's day than the current era - we now have 10 year contracts for staging races - in the 80's it was much more random affair. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, 6 different American tracks, 3 different British tracks, Austria, Switzerland, even Portugal to name a few. There were also plenty of one off and non-championship races at a wide variety of locations.

Its equally true that teams would have as many as 6 drivers in a season, just look at the [teams and drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Formula_One_season#Drivers_and_constructors) in the 1980 season.

That's one of the reason's it's taken 22 years for this record to come close to being broken. Prost had a 13 year career with 199 race starts, Lewis has had an 8 year career to date with 154 starts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greece - as I've identified above simply didn't reform its economy. Spain and Ireland's problems stem from their respective property booms and they both had pretty well managed economies. Italy is just a mess politically and no one had their hands on the controls.

Arguably the Euro played a role in all, it helped in some places but not in others, and none would have survived without Eurozone bailouts. I'm afraid you can't lay all of these problems at the door of the EU and pretend removing the Euro from the equation would have solved their problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You lost me in the first two lines of your Greece argument - the real problem wasn't the Euro, the problem was that they had 20 years to reform their economy and labour practices and failed to even start doing it until it was far too late. 

Tax avoidance was a national pastime, their public sector was massively bloated and people routinely held jobs but did little or no work.

Closed professions were also a serious problem which caused massive price inflation compared to the rest of Europe. Truckers, pharmacists and those wishing to join 68 other professions had to buy one of a limited number of [licences](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/world/europe/15greece.html?_r=0) costing 500,000 euro or more. 

The truck licences alone made goods ludicrously expensive to transport and that was a drag on everything from manufacturing to general retail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH I'm not hugely enthused by the whole field.

Burnham will always be painted as too close to the Unions, Cooper, also close to the Unions, is inextricably linked to Balls and that will always be used as a mighty weapon against her - both will quickly be painted with the failings of the Blair and Brown cabinets they both bore collective responsibility in. 

I haven't enjoyed Kendall's stridency thus far, and am a *little* more swayed by Creagh. I do think it would be valuable to have a female leader and someone who represents a Northern constituency with irish roots would do very nicely in terms of drawing a contrast against Cameron and Osborne. She can speak to a geographic area in which we have start performing well from experience, and speak with authority on the EU. Reading a little of what she's written in the press it appears she 'gets' Scotland.

I like her position on business, she's good in the Commons and lands punches well, her background means she would be taken seriously on the EU and its is difficult to assail her with the usual 'metropolitan-elite' attacks despite her Oxbridge education.

<TEXT> As Button said after quali: "Coulda, woulda, shoulda". Its very easy to be wise and armchair quarterback after the event. That they considered what might happen if Ferrari pitted is wise, its unlikely that it was the most persuasive factor in their decision in the end.

Drivers don't "complain all the time" drivers tell the team what's happening from their perspective, with the limited amount of information they have, and send messages to the stewards and race control via the only means of communication they have available to them.

With so little time to make a decision it's easy to make a mistake. Brave of Hamilton to maintain composure and say the right things despite what was obviously a devastating loss after a long weekend of very hard work and brilliant driving.

Looking at the threads after the event people are seizing on insignificant things like the team photo and the position bollard and using them to make completely uninformed criticisms. Hamilton put out an amazing quali finding 3 extra tenths over Rosberg twice, then pulled out a 20 second lead over Rosberg during the race at F1's most difficult circuit. Simply amazing stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see how you can claim that it's a widely held view that Hamilton was suddenly and unexpectedly told to pit or that he was at fault. His part in the decision was noted in the race commentary, in his comments after the race, and virtually every article on the topic written since. 

Discussing if it's sensible to pit isn't the same as requesting to pit and many people in this sub are using this as an avenue to criticise Hamilton (who drove an imperious weekend) - especially the Rosbergerttes.

[James Allen's analysis](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2015/05/talking-point-how-will-mercedes-make-it-up-to-hamilton-for-lost-monaco-victory/) (emphasis mine) below. Interesting because it includes the timings (20 secs to make the decision), introduces Nasr's stop as a factor, and explains the parameters of the decision from the team's perspective. 

Also of note is that Toto revealed last night that the [teams don't have GPS at Monaco](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/toto-wolff-we-got-the-maths-wrong/) which would have affected their decision making ability.

Hamilton was part of the decision making process, as he confirmed after the race, telling the team that the soft tyres were losing temperature and pressure behind the safety car and *if there was sufficient gap to easily pit and rejoin on new, warm supersofts for the final 12 laps, it would make sense.* The team was protecting itself from a possible move by Ferrari to pit Vettel onto supersofts and then have him attack them at the restart, when he would have been right behind on faster tyres.

The top line is that there was a transition from Virtual Safety Car to Safety car; at the end of Sector 1 of the lap on which he pitted, Hamilton had a lead over Rosberg of 26.802 seconds, more than enough to pit with a comfortable margin. A pit stop at racing speeds takes 24 seconds at Monaco and at Safety Car speeds you only need a gap of around 17s to make the stop and retain position.

*What happened was that Hamiltons Sector 2 time was slower than he or the team expected; he took 53.240 secs to complete that sector, while Rosberg took just 44.5 secs. The gap came down from 26 seconds to just 18.*

Hamilton lost time behind the Safety Car, in other words, when it picked him up. He then lost another 1.5secs in the pit lane, thats how much slower his stop was than his first stop (which had been the fastest of the day). Nasr went past in the Sauber just as he was due to be released, which added a little to the end of the stop.

As soon as it happened, everyone realised that the move had been a mistake, but as Toto Wolff says, the calculations didnt keep up with the eventualities. Alarm bells should have gone off when Hamilton came through the Sector 2 beam and the gap had been reduced to 18 seconds  this made it a risky move to pit Hamilton. There was little time to think; Sector 3 takes 28 secs to complete across the finish line at Safety Car speeds and so they would have up to 20 seconds before he would need to enter the pits.

As for his reaction many people seem to have forgotten he lost the 2007 WDC on a team call to stay out a lap longer than he should have on tyres that were down to the canvas. I doubt the similarities of the two situations will have been lost on him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You say potato etc. 

Money is unlikely to be a major issue for anyone in this particular situation whatever anyone needs they will get, and it isn't necessarily up to RBR depending on the contract terms he has already - Jos is a canny man.

Williams admitted two races ago that Lotus were faster than they were in a post race radio call, both teams are currently outpacing RedBull handily, both have better engines and better development tracks.

Generally speaking for GP drivers the more promotional work the worse off they are, and it's something that the older they get the less work is in their contracts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Button's comments on the same situation last year:

But is Lewis strong enough to come back? I really think he is. You will see a more determined Lewis at the next race. Canada is a circuit he loves.

I remember with Lewis that when we had a tussle in a race or there was an issue between us or with the team, he would have a really bad race and be quite outspoken and emotional. **And the next race he would destroy me, he would come back stronger than ever**.

The mind games people play on him will not work.

Initially, he is an emotional character and he will be quite hurt but he comes back stronger than ever.

Monaco is a really special race for Hamilton, especially as he's had such poor luck there. But he's a lot tougher than he used to be and Rosberg is the one that chokes under pressure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Toto issued an [explanation](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/toto-wolff-we-got-the-maths-wrong/) - interestingly they have no GPS at Monaco so their calculation was a few seconds off. 3.5 seconds off to be exact!

The simple answer is we got the maths wrong, said Toto Wolff. We thought we had a gap which we didnt have when the safety car came out, and Lewis was behind the safety car and the calculation was simply wrong.

It was the teams decision. We are all in this together, we make decisions together and it is not one person to blame and we win and lose together and that is clear. In Monaco you have no GPS and this makes the whole exercise more difficult, so this is why we got it wrong when we switched from the virtual safety car to the safety car. </TEXT>

I suppose both of those things are possible in 2017 (Massa's contract ends) or if Lotus tire of Crashtor. In fairness someone somewhere must be having a conversation about Grosjean's future as his contract is up this year, so perhaps both Lotus seats might be available in 2016. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you look at their longstanding platform and voter base they pretty much did. One would have to say hubris driven by their best ever election performance. 

Vince cable described what they got during the coalition as "crumbs from the Tory table". The membership of the party could have overridden Clegg at conference on several occasions both on the Coalition deal and on policy. So what I take from this is that, rather than stand up and vote for what they believe in, both the politicians and the party faithful were willing to compromise any position they held in return for those 'crumbs'. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically the article is an opinion piece based on the beliefs of a recently departed staff member and there is no evidence to back it up, it doesn't even mention her position or salary, merely her judgements on others working status. 

The rest is a mish-mash of claims about a group of companies that mostly consists of non-profit NGO's specialising in project design and aid-delivery who maintain staff in the regions where aid is delivered and actually have a pretty good reputation in the aid sector. The 52,000 in the headline is based on the alleged average salaries of the staff at some of the companies, but is completely unsourced.

The remainder is a rehash of claims made by the DT in 2012 along with some sexy sounding, but obviously biased words like 'fat-cat' and 'barron'.

<TEXT> The giant global recession that began in 2008. Economic growth has not returned strongly enough so companies need to keep cash on hand incase of another downturn or other economic 'weather'. Households are doing the same i.e. they have less money to spend on the sponsored products.

Equally true that many western countries have hit market saturation for many products and the law of diminishing returns applies - one of the many reasons F1 is going to new countries and new markets in order to tempt sponsors along.

Sponsors won't really come back until the economic climate improves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have not resigned our seat, but we have no genuine influence within the Security Council. Thanks in large part to our appalling behavior in going into Iraq with Bush, the joke that was our military performance whilst in Iraq and Afghanistan, our absent Navy and outdated airforce. We have nothing serious to offer anyone - as our laughable part the Libya operation proved.

The City of London has been on fire since the recession, little has been done to combat the cultural problems that led to 2008 and it's the banks that have the power, not the treasury. Just look at HSBC's startling intervention in the election campaign - it feared a backlash from no one. An EU exit will lead to the serious players leaving en-masse. Preparations for such an exit are well underway at a number of companies I work with.

We sold Oxford, Cambridge and Sandhurst to the children of dictators and international students when we ceased properly funding higher education. Every university is entirely reliant on private funding and income obtained outside government to stay alive.

We are almost exclusively reliant on private finance, charity, visitor centre income or EU funding to preserve our world heritage and nationally important sites. I had a conversation with English Heritage last year seeking emergency help with a literally collapsing 400 year old listed monument - no money, unlikely to be any money for a decade, I was advised to apply to the EU or the lottery 'thats all we do'.

We remain culturally influential but we're not taken seriously in any office outside Downing Street. The idea of the special relationship is a thin and distant memory because it relied on our ability to influence Europe and military support. </TEXT>

Young people tend to be hit hardest by a recession and recruitment for that generation never returns, hence the 'lost generation' of the 90's and 2008. 

But we're also in the bottom three countries in the OECD rankings, our oldest workers have better and more marketable skills than our youngest, and the fault there is the fall in university places combined with the rise in the cost of education. Both of these factors are a drag on productivity. </TEXT>

95% of all degree graduates get a job, the average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs. 

Salaries for every kind of education below degree, including the vocational courses and apprenticeships are much lower [Source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-333261).

Even the much hated on 'Media Studies' has a 93% employment rate, second only to medicine - that's a better figure than Engineering or Architecture graduates.

Biased nonsense from the DM or DT isn't proof of anything, examine the actual data for yourself without the righty spin. Consider also that just because you had this experience in the employment market, not everyone else does.

Incidentally in 2013 among those who completed their course Media Studies has a 93% employment rate, second only to medicine.

The present decline in those positions is mainly down to the long term effect of 2008 and the increase in unpaid or low paid internships for those leaving education - most of these positions are being funded by the benefits system.

Degree education improves your *lifetime* earning power - not just the few years after you leave university. It doesn't matter if you get a graduate job or not you still earn more from the moment you hit the employment market.

<TEXT> I think they expected a Tory minority government. When you examine the changes they made in the fixed term parliament act - removing dissolution of parliament for a defeated queens speech, defeated major legislation and the like they clearly had in mind the problems faced by the Major government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Based on what you had to say there is no point in disagreeing with you - there isn't anything anyone could say to you that would deter you from these uninformed talking points.

To be brief: 

Lower educational numbers are a drag on productivity, even Osborne recognises this. Courses that you apparently don't consider valid (possibly because your interest is in dismissing the label rather than understanding the course) result in higher earnings and higher economic productivity in the long term - this directly affects GDP and the nature of the courses doesn't actually matter, its the level of study alone that works.

The same is true in employment related courses - the Farage favorite of stable hand qualifications and hairdressing courses. These improve wages and enable employment mobility i.e. if you can demonstrate your experience on paper you stand a much better chance of getting a better job with better pay. FYI a qualified salon colourist able to mix their own dyes earns 90 per hour, the reason it's a BSc course and not a BA is that a substantial part of a colourists job is chemistry.

The bloated middle management talking point is simply nonsense when discussing an organisation with 1.6 million staff. Small numbers of senior management can't possibly make decisions with enough focus to run an organisation on that scale without middle management - the same is true in any large private sector organisation. The example you cite '5 a day coordinator' may seem silly to you but the organisational role is about improving preventative healthcare and education i.e. saving money before it's spent.

International aid is 10 billion in a 700 billion budget. This is a talking point because some people don't like who its spent on and lack the wit to understand why it's spent and what benefit the country derives from it. For example, DFID was a major donor to the LUBILOSA Programme which developed a biological pesticide for locust control in Sahel zone across Africa. This developed a commercial product in conjunction with British scientists (which provided funding to British Universities) and was commercialised as a product by British and French companies. So this one programme created jobs in the UK, provided jobs and experience for graduate scientists, improved the agricultural output of a swath of Africa (which assists in famine prevention and thereby reduces emergency aid in the long term), and resulted in British and French companies creating lasting partnerships.

I appreciate that these things seem daft to you, but the fault lies in your understanding of what's happening and it's outputs, not the way the money is being spent. Perhaps look at the world through another lens rather than DT/DM headlines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both men seem to have gained an appreciation for what their collective hubris cost them in 2007. 

Ron lost control of the team that represents his life's work, Alonso lost a guaranteed shot at four further WDC's, and results that were at least as good as Ferrari's, potentially better with him in the car.

So I suspect that, older and wiser, they really have set aside their differences because they both need each other very badly indeed. Neither has any other move left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He isn't wrong, apparently fear of a functioning democracy in Scotland is a major driver for English voters, which is simply sad.

The problem amongst the LibDem's appears to be that the parliamentary party views the coalition as a heroic effort to save the country from a minority government whereas their voters simply view them as traitors. 

When the Libs lost 25% of their membership post the tuition fees fiasco, or when they were annihilated in the council elections two years ago you'd have thought they would have reversed course and thought about their supporters - apparently not - equally apparently the parliamentary party don't seem to have changed their view of the coalition since the election. </TEXT>

Most of the people complaining, just as you are, are sore because they were on the wrong end of a deal and didn't get what they wanted or what they thought they were due. Thems the breaks.

<TEXT> Refueling rigs are expensive to buy, you need a team of four additional people to maintain and operate them during the race, further people on the FIA end to inspect them, people to pack them up, more people back at base to optimise the fuel delivery, additional vehicles to transport them to and from the airport or seaport, and the air and sea freight is expensive.

The teams, according to RBR, have five versions of their race setup on the ocean or in the air at any one time. So its not just one rig you need to buy five. They also have two versions of their pit crew so thats at least eight additional staff to hire, transport and accomodate.

There is also additional work, parts, and maintenance on the cars to consider, and more work for the team's own safety officers.

In any form of business staff are always the most expensive component.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're claiming Bernie wanted a bribe, that sounds terribly corrupt, when in fact was he was offering was a deal to stage a race.

Grands Prix are mostly run on 10 year contracts, so offering a resign at the 8 year stage is pretty reasonable especially if the commercial environment has changed - in the case of Adelaide the transport fees had increased steeply thanks to the oil market. So, as **you** said, they were offered a deal, dithered over it, and lost the GP and lost as a result. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically in F1 the manufacturers pay for the racing and form the basis of the grid. They subsidised 50% of the cost of the engines in the V8 formula, and they're still heavily subsidising the cost now. Without the manufacturers the sport simply wouldn't exist. The foundation of the current Formula was laid the day BMW exited saying this:

Premium [brands] will increasingly be defined in terms of sustainability and environmental compatibility. This is an area in which we want to remain in the lead. In line with our Strategy Number ONE, we are continually reviewing all projects and initiatives to check them for future viability and sustainability. Our Formula One campaign is thus less a key promoter for us - Norbert Reithofer

In other words the sports strategy needed to change, particularly in the light of the global recession, in order to keep the manufacturers we did have and hopefully attract new ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see - in your mind 'race fee' is equal to a 'bribe'. Got it.

FOM pays for all the safety work, FIA oversight, stewards, medical staff, transport and shipping, hotels, basically the cost of getting the personnel and the show to the venue and back. But mainly 60% of its revenue forms the prize money the teams get - so when you support a team calling for more money you also support increasing the race fee.

In short Melbourne outbid Adelaide. By your own admission they were offered a deal to resign but dithered over it and Bernie went to Melbourne who wanted the race more. Business is business. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He made it, he gets to do mostly what he wants with it, and for the most part he's looked after his bit it pretty well. 

Personally all I see is a bunch of armchair quarterbacks who have little idea about the realities being faced crying because they didn't get the rules mix they thought would solve all of their issues. I've listened to it for nearly four decades, and no matter what solution is offered someone is always sore, someone else claims it isn't proper racing, and it'll all be Bernie's fault no matter who made the decision or what governing structures were in place. 

But really this whole thing is about rich teams, rich manufacturer's, rich team owners and slightly richer business people making a deal where everyone gets a bit of what they wanted.

Big business is corrupt full stop, its less corrupt than it used to be, but it just is and saying you want one rich guy to die isn't really changing anything is it?

What will Bernie's death change anyway? FOM doesn't dictate the rules, Bernie rarely gets everything he wants (which if you listen to the details is often more in touch with what the fans want than the teams). Bernie will be replaced and things will carry on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking as a former Theatre pro, there isn't really a problem with the industry. People outside the major cities, especially young people, simply stopped going to the theatre for fun in large enough numbers for it to be sustainable. In an environment where there is so much competition for the entertainment  rep theatre simply lost (so did pubs and the music industry, but that's another story).

Rising costs to the public in terms of tickets, transport, food and drink, obviously didn't help. The fact that the sheer effort involved in organising an evening out increased as working hours lengthened is also a factor, as is parents keeping teens on a tighter leash. But the reality is you can stick a good HBO show on your HD TV, or download a good movie for 4 and be just as entertained as going out to the theatre without any hassle. In fact you can be *reliably* entertained, and the same can't be said for rep theatre.

The result is virtually the only shows that are sustainable are large scale musicals, pantomimes, and new writing (things you can't watch on the TV at home). That being the case basically all the rep theatres are closing or merging and all that remains are regional receiving houses and even those are under threat.

People do love the idea of the theatre, they simply don't go it and then act unhappy when the local theatres close. Theatre seems to be entertainment for *other* people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its easy to be cynical about this, but the electorate has apparently changed significantly which is why the pollster's models didn't work.

The [election results show](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9418) that Labour areas became more polarized and the same thing happened in Conservative areas. Previously Liberal areas went Blue en masse, and the downward Labour trend in Scotland since 2003 accelerated massively. 

It's going to be fascinating finding out what exactly has changed and the drivers behind it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's facing a political reality where there are two main right wing parties in England that hate him and one main left wing party that merely dislikes him quite a bit. 

So I suspect comments like this are, as you say, him trying to appear relevant to his members.

All that said, he isn't wrong in what he said, and the fault lies in the failure of the party to bring the Unions with it as it progressed over the last 50 years. Something that's simply resulted in the Unions becoming more and more extremist as the party has moderated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point being that engine costs were going to increase substantially when the cost cap arrangement ended in any case. 

Most fan argument places the V8 cost at 8 million, ignores the subsidisation and its impending end, and argues the cost of the new engines is 20 million (which is still a subsidised cost) is too high and the increase too great for the non-works teams to bear. In reality the V6 formula is only a small amount more expensive than the V8 formula would have been without Mosley's cost cap.

Essentially the fan argument contends one group of rich people (the teams) is more deserving of cost reduction than another group of rich people (the manufacturers) and expects the latter to pick up the tab for the former, whilst conveniently ignoring the fact that they have been paying for the sport's existence for a long time. 

The wider point is that the manufacturers and teams do not make a profit from being in F1 directly - it's a marketing platform for virtually everyone except Sauber and Manor. Every successful outfit has a strong underlying business, all of the so called 'minnows' do not, and it's telling that Williams resurgence is closely aligned with its development of a technology business.

Of the 137 official F1 constructors that participated since 1950 only 10 remain active - costs and rules were a problem in 1950, and they remain a problem today. Realistically the sport needs to look hard at what is and isn't a successful business model for a team when it considers new entrants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> F1 teams were, and still are, receiving subsidised engines and the v8 version of that deal expired. The v8s actual cost was around 16 million as season, but the teams got the engines for 8 million. So the terms of cost reduction in much of the fan argument are very relativistic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends what new technology eliminates when you want to claim something is dirty vs something else. Hydrogen, for example, is extraordinarily inefficient when compared to batteries [here's Elon Musk explaining why](https://youtu.be/Y_e7rA4fBAo?t=10m21s). 

Between Tesla and Apple battery technology has improved dramatically in just 8 years.

Home batteries that can charge overnight and power the home during the day have arrived. This reduces demand, which eliminates power stations, and makes them cleaner than the current solution. 

Every car manufacturer has gone hybrid, and cars will be mainly electrically powered within the decade. That eliminates not only fossil fuels, but the transport systems that support its delivery, and the environmental damage caused by its discovery, refining and extraction. Because of this batteries are actually cleaner than current solutions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Labour led four Lab/Lib coalitions in the Scottish Parliament, each garnering less and less support until the 2007 wipeout. Of the 73 constituencies in Scotland, only 20 are now represented parties other than the SNP. Labour had to rely on regional lists to get its seats the last time around.

The evidence suggests that trend will continue in 2016. 

IMO you're completely right, it would have been had we had the sense to send some of our best back to Scotland or keep them there in the first place. Sadly Westminster was always the priority.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its very easy to say that, particularly with justifiable disdain for the other political parties involved. But members in Scotland quite rightly ask what did our support for those MP's and Prime Minister's deliver *for* Scotland - I hear the same questions asked in the North of England. I can't point to anything, can you?

I chuckle a little as I hear the millennial generation criticised for being selfish and self absorbed by a generation that bought them up that way, it throws the 'small britain' politics of the day into sharp relief. Everyone seems deeply concerned that someone else is getting something they're not. No one believes their voices are being heard or their issues attended to, I don't see the party offering a solution to that narrative as the different wings sharpen their sticks for the leadership election, merely playing to it. </TEXT>

One has to ask what the Scottish contingent of Labour MP's were working on for the last few years that was more important than working *in* Scotland? 

If the truth is (as I suspect) that the leadership and the Scottish contingent did not realise the work was necessary until halfway through indyref, then we deserve what happened north of the border. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 1996, around four hours after registering at uni in Edinburgh, I found myself listening to Alex Salmond speak. All of the main parties had been invited to student hustings to encourage party registration but only Salmond turned up.

Already being a Labour member (grandson of trade unionists, I had a lifetime membership three months after conception) I was campaigning for the devolution referendum a year later. What I found was quite shocking. The branches barely met, had no policy ideas, and mainly operated as a poorly attended social club. 

On the doorstep allegations of 'red tory' were common and you would really struggle to disagree with them - the elite of Scotland were all Labour voters and had no interest dealing with the extraordinary poverty on the sink estates surrounding the major cities or the complexities of life in remote communities.

By 1999 Dewar had returned from Westminster to lead the Scottish Assembly. He was a popular figure, but many in the party struggled with the fact that he had left Scotland for career, like so many other young people, and was only now returning for a coronation. Just like Murphy, Cook, Brown, Darling, the list is endless.

Listening to a friend who had gone to Scotland for the independence campaign describe the state of the party in Scotland it was clear to me nothing had changed. The leadership could best be described as the 'z' team, many in the party supported independence, the branches remained social clubs, and the members were disengaged from a campaign that had nothing to offer *for* Scotland but 'their figures are wrong', 'don't do something you'll regret'.

Alex Salmond wanted the referendum date, Cameron wanted straight Yes or No, Labour wanted DevoMax. Salmond and Cameron did a deal and placed Labour in a trap, and we walked straight into it without a second thought. 

Neither Unionist party could present a positive vision for Scotland via a new Scotland Act so Darling waged an entirely negative campaign fighting for the status quo with vague promises of a new settlement after 2015. Communities were divided, friends and families stopped speaking to each other - a deep anger bubbled to the surface. Quite obviously the 'victory' was pyrrhic - literally bonfire of the vanities.

Parachuting in Murphy at the last minute with nothing new to offer was just more of the same garbage that Scottish voters had been hearing for the last half century and I'm not at all surprised it didn't work.

If Labour wants its voice heard in Scotland again it needs to be a voice *from* Scotland speaking to England fighting for Scottish issues and not the other way around. We need a strong Scottish Labour party that believes in the union and can say in a single sentence why the union is worthwhile. The exact same thing is true in Wales. If we can't provide those voices then independence should happen now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a media trick designed to deal with overwhelming negative coverage in the media. 

Basically Labour couldn't get any positive message into the print media, so it tried the immigration mug. All of the press printed the photo of the mug complete with the 'strong on immigration' message, and from that point on the tone of the story didn't matter, the voters read the message.

The stone was a step too far, but again the media printed the picture with the messages on it intact. Had Labour won it would have been quite a clever way of getting 'promises set in stone', which is a wedge issue with certain voter groupings, into wide circulation.

Likely an Axelrod idea - think the Obama 'hope' poster - which worked very well in the states. The Tories did it in 2010 election with the DC posters and UKIP at the EU election with their posters - left media exploded and they got a ton of free media from their ad buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The electoral landscape shifted against the party in an extremely difficult to surmount way - we would now need 13% swing to get a majority, the Tories only need 6%. 

The electoral system was tilted against the Tories through the last couple of decades because Labour and LibDem supporters in marginals were prepared to vote tactically to keep the Tories out, and many LibDem seats were Lib/Con marginals with the Tories in second place. All of that is over.

We lost votes to the Tories in former Liberal seats, to the Greens everywhere, and notably the SNP in Scotland. Liberal votes went Conservative en masse, and the remainder to the Greens. UKIP hurt us rather than the Tories, because we lost votes to them and their vote turned out to be softer than expected allowing the Tories to win. The Labour vote is being squeezed at the top, bottom, and middle.

In Conservative seats we needed to win there was a swing *to* the Tories, and in seats we already held there was a swing *to Labour* - we got piles of votes where we didn't need them and lost votes where we did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Emails which Alonso then sent to Bernie, and Bernie sent to the FIA. This is a matter of record in a hearing at the World Motorsport council - these are facts and not in any form of dispute.

Also, your attempt to correlate the dispute in qualification and turn it into a blackmail situation has no basis in reality, and has no proof backing it whatsoever.

Again this is a matter of legal record in the World Motorsport Council and is not in dispute. The row occurred in Ron Dennis's motorhome at the race, and happened because Alonso held up Hamilton.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I mean to say that his holding Hamilton up on track thereby ruining his quali, and then when confronted over it, his threat to Dennis to ruin the team's season and McLaren's reputation unless his demands were accommodated show that he's a bad guy - or a least he was at the time.

Strange also that Renault somehow came into possession of detailed technical specs of McLaren's 2006 and 2007 cars later in the season. I wonder how that happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're thinking of the first case which was settled on 26 July 2007 and resulted in no penalty for McLaren (Mosley was unsuccessful).

I'm referring to the second case was heard on 13 September 2007 and was entirely built on the Alonso/De La Rosa/Coughlan emails.

Somehow Alonso's emails had been sent to Bernie, and somehow or other Renault had also obtained extensive technical information on the 2007 McLaren car. I wonder how that happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Ron Dennis was doing that in the early 80s, most famously with Prost and Senna - Many years before Merc were even a modern F1 team. Its one of the most famous things about the team.

In fact, given the McLaren/Mercedes history together, there is a very decent argument that Mercedes modelled their team operation on McLaren and this was the nature of the dispute between Brawn and Lauda/Wolff and Lowe. Brawn being a famous team orders man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alonso wasn't whistleblowing. 

The emails Alonso was threatening to turn over were those exchanged between himself Coughlan and Pedro De La Rosa actually using the Ferrari information between themselves. What he wanted in return for not revealing them was number one status. Dennis refused to be blackmailed and turned the team into the FIA himself. 

Until that point McLaren's story had been that they received the information, but no one actually used it (at least there was no proof that was the case). Since Alonso and De La Rosa had actually used it, and Alonso could prove it from his own email account, that's what blew the case open again. 

The assertions that Dennis treated Hamilton better than Alonso are basically nonsense - Dennis has a very long history of letting his drivers race fairly whereas Alonso was expecting number one status - his treatment after the row with Ron over Spygate was completely understandable as he had basically pissed all over the team and no one at any level of the organisation could tolerate that.

Lets not forget here that Hamilton turned in the best rookie season the sport has ever seen, frequently beating an experienced double world champion with 6 more seasons of F1 experience. Without the team's tyre mistake at the Chinese Grand Prix, he would have won the WDC in his rookie season. </TEXT>

He couldn't cope with being challenged by a rookie so tried to blackmail Ron Dennis, which led to McLaren being disqualified and fined $100 million. 

The only reason he wasn't at least disqualified from that years championship or worse (it was he and De La Rose sharing the data) was that he gave evidence against McLaren for immunity. </TEXT>

Nasr got sponsorship because he's Brazilian *and* good, not because he happened to be the only Brazilian in F1.

As I've pointed out elsewhere, it was Fittipaldi that bought Philip Morris to McLaren, and Alonso who bought in Santander. </TEXT>

*Everyone* is a pay driver at some stage. Gaining sponsors is a competitive advantage in getting an F1 seat, when moving teams, and in paying for a junior career. Even for drivers in a junior programme.

It's not the only six wheeled F1 car, but it is the only one to race - there's the [March 2-4-0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2-4-0), [Ferrari 312T6](http://s183.photobucket.com/user/Starcowboy/media/Enzo/312t2-6a.jpg.html), and even a Williams. Ferrari even tried an eight wheeled version of the [312T6](http://pixgood.com/ferrari-312t6.html)

<TEXT> In which case it doesn't make sense that Fangio still holds so many records, compared to Jackie Stewart who entered 48 more races than he did.

Equally Hamilton holds more records than Senna, even though as of last week, he has entered 152 grand prix compared to Senna's 162. In this case Hamilton and Senna can be directly compared and Hamilton wins that particular contest.

Fangio competed in 52 races over and eight year career winning 46.15% of all the races he entered - no modern era driver can hope to come close to that, so the bias you refer to has a reverse. The result is that many of the records Fangio holds like oldest driver to enter, highest win percentage, cannot be broken in the modern era. Likewise there are some modern records, that Fangio couldn't get near - total laps led, number of consecutive entries.

Finally, if 'chances' mattered then Barrichello, having entered 326 races should hold more records than anyone else, but he only has 19, Alonso should also hold many more records than Hamilton having entered 240 races.

What's really interesting though is that if you knock out the percentage stats, and records that couldn't be broken in the modern era Hamilton is the second best driver ever behind Vettel, because Schumacher holds a lot of records simply through the longevity of his career - which is also a record. </TEXT>

He's already eclipsed Clark (36), Senna (37), Lauda (16), Prost (42), Mansell (29), Stewart (14), Fangio (37), Ascari (20), Hill (5), Hkkinen (17), Alonso (46), N. Rosberg (16) and many more. 

He's also the only active driver increasing his count of records at the moment - adding 4 in 2014, Vettel was down 5 in the same period.

<TEXT> For much of the 94' pre-season and virtually the whole of the season teams were concerned about safety because active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control had all been banned and no attempt had been made to curtail speed. 

*This is fact*, its not disputed by anyone with direct knowledge of the season, and in all of the incidents I highlighted speed and load on vehicle components were the defining factor of the crashes.

All of the on track incidents occurred because of critical component failure under load or simple loss of control i.e. the cars had been designed for electronic stabilisation systems that were no longer available. Williams remain unable to directly attribute Senna's accident to component failure (although all of that remains murky), and there remains a credible argument that, under pressure on a flat out corner with a bumpy track, he lost a difficult car that he was not yet comfortable with.

Weather was not a factor in the crashes of Senna, Ratzenberger, Barichello, Wendlinger, or Montermini - all of which were avoidable and severe. </TEXT>

There will be a number of different components to the contract and each will require singular expertise their field i.e. you'll have someone on personal terms, someone on image rights, someone on sporting terms etc - a large contract such as this may even involve multiple law firms working together. 

The majority of the term negotiations between the parties are conducted by each side's lawyers and accountants within the direction set by their clients. You only involve the principles when there is approval required, a disputed issue, or to finalise a component. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We came close to doing that in 1994 - banned all of the traction and driver aids that 'purist' fans said were ruining the racing, had little in the way of meaningful surface aero, and teams could run as close to the ground as they liked.

Ultimately, the cars were simply too quick and powerful to be controllable in general, and even modestly safe when something went wrong. None of the circuits were ready for such high speed accidents. Senna's death disguises a [series[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSI27en56tg) [of[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUxMLIbtIk) [terrifying[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xumw9c5j-3A) [accidents[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-nSWjdpHI) and on track [incidents[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxMtYyNZ6Q) during 1994 that are rarely talked of anymore. The pit lane speed limits and downforce reduction measures we see today all came from that season's racing - 1994 defines modern F1.

"Its going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesnt happen." - Ayrton Senna, during the 94' pre-season.


In the end the 94' season left two drivers dead, another in a coma, one seriously injured marshall, five injured spectators, and a seriously injured mechanic.

No one wants the spending war ground effect floors would bring, and no one wants 1994 to happen again. 

Be very careful what you wish for in this regard.

To achieve that you'll need lawyers for both parties at both ends, assistants to handle messaging, arrange meetings, check amendments, and even negotiate non-important terms (i.e. things that you wouldn't trouble Lewis about) and a variety of other minutiae.

<TEXT> She said

"There are small improvements, but the road is still very long."

This a woman who is extremely close to the family and who has spent each day since the accident fending off almost any media speculation or stories about Schumacher. So for her to actually comment and say something positive (however small) is really good news.

With the type of injuries suffered by both Schumacher and Bianchi all you can really expect are (very) small improvements. A member of my family, sadly a child, suffered serious brain trauma and it took four years for any real progress to manifest itself. </TEXT>

The innovation was the mounting of the engine at 3.5 degrees to assist ground effect - something [copied more sucessfully by the Ferrari F10](http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/f1-the-striking-1979-arrows-a2-that-inspired-the-2010-ferrari-f10?artid=115830). </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but more recently the wind-tunnel issues demonstrated where their real problems lay. 

The engineers said we need a new 60% scale wind tunnel, management said make do with what you have. Basically the next four years were a write off! Management simply didn't understand the needs of the team - using alternative facilities whilst fixing their own basically cost five times as much.

It's one example, but it highlights the problem. The decision makers just didn't get it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 6 points is almost half the deficit! That Ferrari also wasn't as good as the McLaren in fast corners and was hard on its tyres. He could have won Monaco had he shown more patience.

You also forget Schumacher stalled it on the grid in Japan before the puncture. As I said, if he and the Ferrari had performed better he would have sealed it, but the car let him down and he made too many unforced errors. The DC crash hurt, but he had plenty of chances. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several reasons:-

- Voting for this may allow them to make a deal on something they want now, or in the future.

- The extra engine might be helpful to Mercedes.

- Sporting considerations - everyone wants a competitive series.

- Having several teams able to test new engines (which may have upgraded components compared to race engines) allows Mercedes plenty of room for development and curing reliability issues.

Its more likely that Mercedes would be influenced by their customer teams needs. Down grid, RBR and McLaren are a potential threat to Lotus and Williams - both teams where money plays a more significant role and data gathering is helpful (though not dramatically so). </TEXT>

He and Alonso have a relationship going back to Renault, but [I always thought that](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula-one/22470411) it was Alonso that wanted Allison rather than the other way around.

James Allison starting at Ferrari on Sept 1 as chassis tech direc will likely help pacify a certain Spaniard today, bet the phone's been hot - Martin Brundle

Of course Vettel had a stated preference for Kimi.

Id prefer Kimi. I need to be careful now. Nothing against Fernando, I respect him a lot as a driver but I think I respect Kimi on track and off track because hes always been very straight with me and from that point of view it might be a bit easier. </TEXT>

Interesting though, I'd long suspected that Ferrari had an informal deal with Vettel [because of his relationship with Schumacher, and Schumacher's dislike for Alonso] that when he was ready to move they would open the door. This also confirms that Ferrari left Alonso rather than the other way around.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ferrari just seem to have pursued a completely different car concept. 

If I understand RBR correctly they relied on the short nose solution to deal with the turbulent air over the front wheels, couldn't get it through the crash tests, and the car is a dog without it. Hence their thinking that they will see major gains now they have it working. 

Ferrari appear to have focussed on unleashing last years aero-compromised engine, improving the suspension geometry, and getting the cooling right, rather than expending staff time and money on the nose. </TEXT>

His first team was BMW Sauber. He had a slightly unusual route into F1 through several German series, but I believe it was actually BMW that funded his test driver seat because they wanted a German driver for their own F1 team. Of course by the time he was ready they were pulling out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was Ron's second F2 team, Project 4, that took over McLaren rather than the other way around. The MP4 designation [originally meant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) 'Marlboro Project 4', and was later changed to mean 'McLaren Project 4'. This only goes to show how deep the relationship with Philip Morris was.

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem - my context wasn't clear in any case.

My partner is Black as is my closest friend and as a result I've become more aware of the subtleties of racism, or what could better be described as racially motivated criticism, than I otherwise might have been. 

Much of the commentary directed at Hamilton carries a tone of 'otherness' with it - its seeking to highlight aspects of his character, tone, style, and personal behavior that are different than what is perceived to be the 'norm' if you see what I mean. If you want to undermine something you raise questions of validity and highlight things that are seen as outside the mainstream of opinion.

For example. You could say that 'Schumacher was a great driver, but not a great sportsman' - if you wanted to acknowledge the greatness but undermine the validity of his considerable achievements by attacking his character. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My example wasn't specific to Moss's comments - I had meant in general, sorry if that didn't come across. 

I'm also not labelling *any* criticism directed at Hamilton racist, much of it clearly isn't and I share your feelings on this. But, there is quite a lot flak sent in his direction over the gold chain he likes to wear, certain celebrity friends, flat peaked baseball cap, 'hip hop' (i.e. not specifically music but black music), etcetera. I do feel has a racial motivation behind it because, broadly, its highlighting behavior or ways of dressing that are common in the black community but not in others, and the tone of such commentary is always critical.

Equally when you compare the media and fan treatment of Mansell, Hill and Button (basically national treasures in this country) with the way Hamilton is spoken about the contrast is quite stark. Hamilton is arguably the most successful British racing driver ever to have hit an F1 track, yet the validity of his achievements is constantly questioned in a way that other recent British champion's haven't been. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is that such things are used as a form of criticism of Hamilton, as /u/jimbodeeny demonstrated above when he said:

Probably something more like a racing driver Dan Blizerian than #blessed hip hop star Hamilton.

This kind of thing wouldn't be said in the same way about a white driver, its being used as a 'dog whistle' for less pleasant language and is clearly racially motivated. 

Damon Hill, for example, played guitar with George Harrison and Def Leopard while he was driving, in fact he appeared on the opening track of Def Leopard's 'Demolition Man' album. He and Eddie Jordan regularly played music together at post race events - this was never used as criticism at the time or since. </TEXT>

When people like the English Defence League are putting your quotes on T-Shirts you should wonder if your views aren't a little out of touch. 


"In those days we were proud to be English. It's different now, there's probably only about ten million of us Englishmen left. All the others have come in here from God knows where....."

On women in motorsport:

"We've got some very strong and robust ladies, but, when your life is at risk, I think the strain of that in a competitive situation will tell when you're trying to win. The mental stress I think would be pretty difficult for a lady to deal with in a practical fashion. I just don't think they have aptitude to win a Formula 1 race."

The colour scheme was shortlived: McLaren only ran in orange F1 livery between 1968 and 1971, incorporated a notional orange streak into its Yardley-liveried cars of 72 and 73 and phased it out completely when Emerson Fittipaldi brought the full red-and-white might of Philip Morris Tobacco onboard when he joined for 1974.

<TEXT> The [video isn't any less terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1pJo3sLpVk) than the photos.

Only yesterday I was pointing out that of the 29 regular drivers that started the 1968 season alongside Jacky Ickx, 13 died racing or testing in the 7 or 8 years that followed (though only a few in F1). Driving was a brutal career in those days.

They were: McLaren, Rindt, Clark, Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser.

In May 1967 Bandini was racing at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, when he lost control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered an S-turn when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It impacted a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, gasoline leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the gas tank exploded after Bandini had been pulled away from the Ferrari.

Bandini's burns were extensive, with third degree burns covering more than 70% of his body. The worst burns were on his arms and legs with slight burns on his face. Doctors were forced to wait for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before resolving to move Bandini to a hospital in Lyon, France, which specialized in the treatment of burns. Other options considered, by the doctors, were flying in skin grafts from Italy or a specialist burns unit team from East Grinstead in England. The burns caused severe lesions. He also sustained a chest wound and ten chest fractures.

Three days later, Bandini succumbed to his injuries. He died at Princess Grace Polyclinic Hospital in Monte Carlo. There were concerns about the promptness of Bandini's rescue. However, investigators from the Principality of Monaco ruled on 10 May "that the security operation had functioned properly." The straw bales, having been banned from all Formula 1 races in response to the accident, were replaced by an extended guard-rail the following year.

Bandini was buried in Reggiolo on 13 May. 100,000 people attended the funeral. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mercedes dropping away, or other teams catching up on their development depending on how you view it, in general thats the long term effect of the rule changes on the engineering side. There is basically one or two good ways to get the best out of x rule inside x car concept, and the competition is to see who can find and balance that against the rest of the car more quickly.

According to legend Hamilton was convinced by the factory tour, just as Alonso was by the same thing at Honda. Both appear have felt the engineering commitment sufficient to put them in contention for wins.

30 odd years watching says you can never count Ferrari out (for the first time in those years I have a positive view of Ferrari), and they appear to be on track for a good 2016. Personally I don't take the potential move seriously - but you never know. </TEXT>

The engine installation seems to be off, mapping, brakes, balance, the car seems to be a dog. I also have to say that IMO the attitude of the team management is helping their cause at all, and it may be time for a change.

<TEXT> Absolutely, but it appears to me that its the power delivery rather than than the bhp that is the real difference. Merc had by far the best power unit in the two years preceding 2014, but didn't have the chassis to match it. But they were focussing on 2014 and little else.

I'm not counting RBR out in the slightest and I believe they'll get a lot out of the B spec car, but I don't think they'll be racing at the front because of it. Will certainly enjoy finding out though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll bet Ferrari are holding their updates until after Monaco - the package they have right now seems well optimised for the hotter races and could do very well there, especially with their excellent cooling setup. 

Interestingly Ferrari don't seem [bothered by the short nose](http://www.espn.co.uk/f1/story/_/id/12622228/james-allison-explains-ferrari-nose-design). Red Bull were having issues with the crash tests and, I guess, built the car with that kind of nose in mind. Perhaps that's why they're expecting such large gains from it. Ferrari seem to created have a different car concept entirely, rather than investing a lot of staff time into a crash tests and such.

I do wonder if there wasn't a price elsewhere on the RBR car for getting the short nose done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd left Hulme out only because he lived to an age, even though he died racing, he survived his era so-to-speak. 

Obviously you're correct. I'd tried to phrase it so it was clear-ish (i.e. racing or testing without qualifying the series) that relatively few died in F1 cars but didn't succeed! It was commonplace, even expected, in that era to drive in multiple series though. 

Its an awful list, and that was just one season's drivers, almost all were dead before 1975. Sad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's because SAP is a team sponsor, but they're one of a shrinking number, and only three of 10 teams on the grid have a title sponsor right now (Sahara don't count as they own 40% of the team).

What SAP specifically get is proof their cloud solution works in one of the worlds most data intensive professions, and their competitors in that field, Microsoft, also sponsor F1 extensively. But SAP's real involvement is with McLaren Technology group and their F1 and road car computer systems.

However none of that is what we're talking about at all. Sponsors are increasingly funding younger drivers as a low cost, high value, route into the sport. Santander for example funded young Alonso - he took their personal sponsorship to McLaren (and left them there, where they picked up Button), and to Ferrari, where he again left them. Maldonado bought in PDVSA who are major sponsors of his old team and new one. Teams very often give slots on the car to drivers management to place, and increasingly so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of the drivers that competed alongside him died that way, in that era you had less than 40% shot at surviving your racing career. Many successful drivers walked away after a WDC win, not wanting to chance their luck any further.

Ickx, started in F1 1968. Of the 29 drivers that completed more than one race in that season 13 died racing or testing in the years that followed - 46% of them. They were McLaren, Rindt, Clark, ~~Hill,~~ Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser. 

Edit: As /u/meowlong points out, not all of these drivers were killed in F1, but its worth saying that this is because it was commonplace at the time to race in multiple series. This isn't a comment on F1 safety specifically. </TEXT>

Fangio won two drivers championships with the team.

The 'Silver Arrows' name came from their domination of the old Grand Prix series in the 1930s, and they entered F1 in 1954 with Fangio switching from Maserati to join the team and immediately dominated the 54' and 55' seasons winning everything in sight. Sterling Moss partnered Fangio in 1955.

This should also sound familiar, past is prologue for Mercedes!

Sadly it was the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR that [went airborne and killed 79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMoh5hZAaZk) people after hitting the back of Lance Macklin's Austin-Healey at the 1955 Le Mans, their Magnesium Alloy body work increasing the severity of the post accident fire. The crash wasn't their fault, but they took the hit for it, and withdrew from all motorsport afterwards. </TEXT>

Damon Hill - which is the point. The sport needs to improve driver branding, because that's the main method by which sponsors are coming to the sport these days.

It's ridiculous no matter what excuse you use.

Only if you have no idea how marketing actually works and how sponsors are coming to the sport.

<TEXT> Nope, that's failing to understand what Ron actually said.

Why would the team go *back* to a livery that they have barely used in the modern era, in fact a livery that they only used for two years, and has little association with the team for most fans - what would it get them? 

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for.

However, most people now associate the team with the silver/grey livery so they made a decision to stick with it and add in some Honda branding, the black appears to have been part of a deal with Johnnie Walker or SAP that fell through looking at their previous sponsor branding. But really the whole thing was a message to Honda and to sponsors - we're willing to change it, but you need to get on board and pay us in order to do so.

FYI the silver colour is for Mercedes, West's branding always appears on a white background. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope. They want drivers to have the same helmets because the drivers are the driving force behind team sponsorship these days (Alonso brought Santander in, Maldonado PDVSA, Hamilton got Bombardier and IWC in the door, Will Stevens has the sponsor slots at Manor). 

Basically the driver's 'brands' have become more important to the sport than the team brands and one thing F1 can do to support that is increase the association between drivers and their helmets thus strengthening their brands. Fixed driver numbers is a tilt at the same thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We came close to doing that in 1994 - banned all of the traction and driver aids that 'purist' fans said were ruining the racing, and had little in the way of meaningful aero - look what happened. 

Sincerely, the cars were simply too quick and powerful to be controllable in general, and even modestly safe when something went wrong. Senna's death disguises a [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSI27en56tg) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUxMLIbtIk) [terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xumw9c5j-3A) [accidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-nSWjdpHI) and on track [incidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxMtYyNZ6Q) during 1994 that are rarely talked of anymore. The pit lane speed limits, and downforce reduction measures we see today all came from that season's racing.

"Its going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesnt happen." - Ayrton Senna, during the 94' pre-season.

The 94' season left two drivers dead, one in a coma, one seriously injured marshall, five injured spectators, and a seriously injured ferrari mechanic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were 4 other 180 mph crashes at Tamburello in the years leading up to Senna's crash - all drivers survived with the worst injury being a severe concussion. Its a flat out corner with a river behind it, hence the concrete wall. Arguably the severity of Bergers crash foreshadowed Senna's but all of the crashes involved some kind of technical failure, and all look very similar.

- [Piquet 87'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLyAKkeA25Q); 
- [Patrese 92'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCcf_aTuldY) ; 
- [Berger 89'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVxnkaqqO2c); 
- [Alboreto 91'](http://flatoutcombr.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/alboretocrash.jpg). 

Which is all by way of saying that Senna crash led to F1 managing downforce and thereby speed, but all of that was really a consequence of the driver aids ban. In many important respects the FW14B remains the most technically advanced F1 car ever created.

Both deaths led to the HANS device as they were both on a [long list of drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HANS_device#History) that sustained basilar skull fractures. Senna's death wasn't caused by the skull fracture though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A decade of attempts to prosecute Patrick Head and Adrian Newey failed to clear up the cause of the accident - IMO we would have been better off without a prosecution looking for fault. In the years that followed the conspiracy theories surrounding the crash muddied the waters enough that anyone with a genuine interest in what happened couldn't ask even the simplest question about it and get a sensible answer. 

The broad conclusion seems to be that the last minute modifications that Senna had requested to the steering column were badly executed, failed, and that caused the accident. Williams contend that the column failed on impact - but there was certainly some kind of cover up involved given what happened to the [black boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ayrton_Senna#Trial). That said there were certainly other factors both sporting and otherwise involved. At least three of the cars in that race, particularly the Benneton that Senna was racing, were running [illegal software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Formula_One_cheating_controversy), there are some questions over the tyres and the condition of the circuit - but accidents are never caused by just one factor. 

For me the worst part is that had the angle or speed of impact been fractionally different he probably would have survived, just as the 4 other drivers who had 180 mph crashes just there did. 

The files from [the trial](http://www.ayrton-senna.com/s-files/trialidx.html) are worth a read, particularly the testimony from the 4 other drivers that crashed at Tamburello in the years preceeding the 94' accident, and its also worth reading [Beatris Assumpcao's](http://betisesportsworld.net/2014/05/01/senna-what-bernie-really-said-to-leonardo-senna/) (Ayrton's PR) first hand account of the conversation between Bernie and Leonardo Senna after the accident (bear in mind only one person in that room was a native English speaker). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The wisdom in this sub seems to be that HAAS will be back of the grid, but looking a Sauber's performance this year I'd suspect mid-field, and aiming to challenge Lotus in a couple of seasons. Heck looking at Sauber this year, they could buy their 2014 chassis and still be mid-field with the Ferrari engine.

Equally interesting is the idea that they might partner with Dallara on a chassis - which could spell the beginning of a true customer car effort for F1.

I can't see why Raikkonen would go there unless he is very desperate for a seat, I also can't see why HAAS would need to pay that much for an experienced driver when there are many cheaper experienced driver options. Then again Hill went to Jordan - stranger things have happened in F1. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, and I've advanced the same argument myself regarding family tickets because I'd love to take my kids to Silverstone. To do that I'm looking at 350 in tickets, 400 for accomodation, at least a 70 tank of fuel and spending money on top of that. All up it's around 1000 - 1200 for a race weekend. Average earnings are around 475 a week.

A 1991 general admission ticket for Silverstone cost me 35, plus 60 travel, 50 for accommodation, and then spending money. At the time I was earning about 250 a week. 

So the price has increased substantially, obviously, but it wasn't exactly cheap to begin with, and having worked at Silverstone for a decade marshalling stands I can't honestly say that motor racing fans in general are working class - we're not NASCAR.

TV is expensive - 700 per year for a sky package - or 139.80 a season for Now TV, and I do think it puts fans off, but it also pays for the show. Its easy to make the argument that anything is too expensive, because everything is, but we do have to face the financial reality of the sport. </TEXT>

I like Hulkenberg, but they have a tradition of pairing rookie's with more experienced drivers and, sad as I am to say it, I don't see what they would get from Hulkenberg that they couldn't get elsewhere for less money and the prospect of a longer career in the team. </TEXT>

I'm quite interested in the idea of Danica Patrick to HAAS, would shake things up quite nicely. Certainly create some positive noise and controversy in the USA market, which will only help bring fans along.

Mercedes are very keen on Pascal Wherlien since they funded Force India's testing to get him some kilometers - he'd have to be in the running if Bottas left Willams, or for the other HAAS seat. </TEXT>

I remember with Lewis that when we had a tussle in a race or there was an issue between us or with the team, he would have a really bad race and be quite outspoken and emotional. And at the next race he would destroy me. He would come back stronger than ever."

"Initially, he is an emotional character, and he will be quite hurt, but he comes back strong. After a bad race he would arrive at the next one very quiet, and then go out and blitz it. He will do the same in Canada - he will probably be untouchable in Canada. And he likes the circuit."

There are quite a few variations of partial quotes knocking around the media sphere but that's the most complete one I could find.

<TEXT> We all have. Hamilton's anger in losing is directed at himself and he uses that on the track the next time out, although sometimes it gets hold of him for long periods - but its an outward reflection of an inner disappointment.

Rosberg gets pissed off at everyone else, does dumb stuff on track, plays tricks that backfire, and/or says something stupid, then lashes out looking for an external source to blame for his errors or lack of success. 

Rosberg is supposed to be the engineer and thinker - but I can't see any evidence that is the case. As /u/cock-a-doodle-doo says, Lewis is in God mode at the moment, nothing Rosberg has in his arsenal is making a dent and blaming Lewis appears to be his only refuge right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We designed engines that output fantastic amounts of heat - the more powerful the engines became the more heat we had to deal with.

Then we designed aero that streamlines the cars movement, but throws off extremely turbulent air.

Then we discovered that a consequence of both was that you would destroy your tyres, and also your brakes, getting near the driver in front - you could barely establish tow anymore - so overtaking became impossible.

DRS and narrower cars and rear wings are a technical solution to a technically generated problem. Push-to-pass is just another solution to the same issue. </TEXT>

Would certainly enliven the driver market as it would open up a few more seats and allow some rookies to show their stuff. I don't think its a horrible idea.

Caterham, Marussia, and similar teams have basically been in a separate F1 class for a very long time, improved reliability has robbed us of the heroic back of the grid podium drives that you used to get when the front four blew up or crashed out, so why not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to [Charlie Whiting](http://en.espn.co.uk/fia/motorsport/story/167205.html) they're not just for show, the sparks are welcome side effect of a downforce reduction and safety measure.

That said according to Brundle Sainz and Ricciardo have said you need to keep your visor shut when following other cars now - the sparks do seem more extreme than they used to be (edit: I'm wrong on this last [point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmgMxqZd9jw) thank you /u/AutoEngineer22 for the reminder).

"To explain: the plank is the long bit of wood, the skids are bits of metal within the plank. The skids have formerly been made of a heavy metal, which has been very resistant to wear, and they put the skids around the points in the plank where thickness is measured. Planks have to start off at nominally 10mm thick and they can't be less than 9mm thick. However, we only measure them around certain holes in the plank. So they position the skids around those holes.

"This metal is extremely heavy and when pieces detach they can be extremely harmful. We saw two punctures in Spa previously because of bits of this metal that lay in a kerb and caused damage. In a worst case scenario they could fly off and hit someone.

"The purpose of making them out of titanium is threefold: Firstly, it's safer, because if they do come off they are about a third of the weight of the existing ones. Secondly, the titanium wears some 2-2.5 times more quickly than the metal currently used. Thus cars will have to be run a little bit higher to manage wear and teams won't be able to drag them on the ground quite as much as they have in the past. The third effect is that you will see a lot more sparks, which some people think will look a little more spectacular."

edit: here is what [the plank looks like](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg/1920px-Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg) on Honda's RC-F1 test car.

<TEXT> I realise that's the meme on costs but where is the evidence that this is a new problem?

Most say 'teams are going under' - since 1950 there have been 137 official F1 constructors, only 10 remain active and the median average constructor competes for 3 seasons, in 20 races, with 5 drivers wins nothing, and scores no points.

'Costs are increasing' - In 2003 Jordan Ford's annual budget was around [$79 million](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams today, some are as low as $80 million. 

Ferrari by comparison were spending $300 - $400 million in 2003, and they're spending around $250 million this year. 

Overall that suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same rather than climbed as steeply as everyone seems to imagine.

People also bang on about the race fee, but FOM has cut sweetheart deals for most of the old european circuits, and has covered Hockenheim's losses since 2009 to the tune of 27 million Euro. People act like the race fee is pure profit that is being drained out of the sport - again no evidence - F1's profits last year were $398 million on $1.6 billion revenue - most of the costs were money paid out to the teams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone is a pay driver, its a distinction without meaning anymore, truth is it's been that way since the 70s. Getting sponsors, getting into a young driver programme, or both is now as much a part of the race as performing on the track. 

Young drivers are having to form investment companies which sell portions of their future earnings to raise the cash to compete.

Sponsors go to drivers and drivers bring them to teams for all but the top four. Alonso bought Santander to McLaren and Ferrari leaving them behind when he left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I imagine they were anticipating that coming along, and losing the German Grand Prix means they have one less race to manage, but that still means each engine has to last 3.8 races rather than 4.75 (obviously 4 and 5 races in practice).

Its going to be very interesting to see how the end of the season plays out. </TEXT>

RedBull actually tested wingless helmets this year to see if they could eliminate helmet lift some other way, but you could see the air displacement in flow-viz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not disagreeing with your logic, but even the 'great' drivers have off years. There are a lot of reasons behind them, but I don't think you can genuinely separate driver from car from team.

For me at least, its *team* sport - part of the race is getting into the good teams with the great cars and learning enough along the way to deliver on track. I've never bought the argument that you could stick any driver in a great car and they'd win - maybe because I've seen too many pairings that prove otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Clark had his off year in 1966 coming 6th in the WDC with Team Lotus - he wasn't beaten by his teammate because he had 8 other drivers and three different engine manufacturers during the season. 

Senna's worst year was 84', his first year, where he came 9th in the WDC. Just like Clark he had multiple teammates that year (3) so wasn't beaten by his teammate. 

Teammate comparisons don't really hold, because its only recently teams have equivalence - most of Senna's teammate's were not anywhere near his class - just reliable number twos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ordinarily I'd agree, but I think Ferrari may have realised that 'their style' is actually a problem for them and so they need to question their own orthodoxy.

Its been pointed out by a number of pundits and commentators that the new drivers have a somewhat different style, 'feel', and approach to racing lines than most of the senior field. I think some of that is down to their having grown up lionising the attacking styles of Hamilton and Vettel rather than the more fluid (in the corners) Schumacher. 

Equally Red Bull and McLaren have done very well out of fast promotions, Ferrari not so much, so I suspect they'll be having a conversation about getting the next generation in the door early on. </TEXT>

So yeah, I'd see him in a Ferrari seat alongside Vettel. It's going to be interesting to see who HAAS take and I can see Lotus abandoning Maldonado which would create some more seats.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drivers have a lot more input into car development than most people on here seem to appreciate - drivers move car development as much, if not more so, than car development moves driving style. 

It's also a challenge to build a team around you, as a driver, that can deliver reliability and win.

Kimi's 35, even he wasn't sure he wanted to race longer than 2015, and he's been happier at Ferrari than any other team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Too much is made of the Hamilton/Ferrari possibility. 

There are plenty of other young drivers worthy of Ferrari's consideration, that Vettel would be compatible with, that would save money in the short term and deliver in the long term. Organisationally they are focussed on the next 5 years, not the next two. 

Verstappen springs to mind, as do several GP2 drivers like Stevens and Wherlien. The younger generation of drivers are really quite different in style than the current senior generation and Ferrari need that input. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do. 

Aside from the fact that Red Bull are *notorious* for making late decisions about driver line ups, there is a straight commercial advantage in ensuring drivers don't take their secrets to other F1 teams. Looking at the way they've played the Renault situation it also fits with the way they think about going racing.

Leaks were a big concern of RBR's when Vettel left and Prodromou departed for McLaren - an entirely justified one as this season has demonstrated so far looking at McLaren's front wing and chassis - but its now obvious that Red Bull have problems deeper than the PU.

It's also worth pointing out that the brain drain from Ferrari over the 2010 WDC benefited Mercedes enormously, and it's a straight line from there to Mercedes 2013 success - Mercedes real innovation was getting the chassis right. They already had the most powerful engine in the two years before 2013. 

In essence Ferrari fired the wrong people in their rush to find someone to carry the can for their 2010 failure, and avoid blaming senior management or the drivers, as was finally noticed at the end of last year. Equally Red Bull appear to have a blame culture problem that extends from the very top of the organisation down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He did, and as I say, I don't want to take away from Ricciardo's achievements, which are many and impressive. There is an unfortunate tendency these days to view saying that, for example, Hamilton is a 'historic' driver as implied criticism of Rosberg - when it isn't. A fast glance at the F1 driver record books is enough to settle that debate.

I haven't lived in Aussie since 2005, but I do remember Murray Walker doing a Channel 10 special with Alan Jones on one of that era's races - perhaps it was just a special. Since I was travelling at the time I wasn't really in touch with TV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's not just the recession, it's the fact that the budgets have climbed so high that nobody wants to pay for the majority of the budget through sponsorship.

Nonsense. In 2003 Jordan Ford's annual budget was around [$79 million](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams, some are as low as $80 million. 

Ferrari by comparison were spending $200 - $400 million in 2003, and they're spending around $250 million this year. 

Which, overall, suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same rather than climbed as steeply as everyone seems to imagine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, on a circuit with two long straights Merc were always going to win if they made the right strategy calls. I was hoping Rosberg would do a better job at the start though and get closer to Hamilton in the opening laps.

Interesting reaction from Rosberg to the Ferrari threat though.

<TITLE> [Build Help] GTX 970 with 2 x 6pin power </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-22 14:36:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking to upgrade a Mac Pro 4,1 with at GTX 970. Mac Pro has 2 x 6 pin power supply leads which provide 75 watts each, so I'm wondering if anyone is aware of a GTX 970 variant which accepts 2 6 pin power leads rather than a single 8 pin. 

Have tried an ASUS Strix with a 6 pin to 8 pin converter, and it works but the card doesn't run anywhere near full power. Novabench scored it at 189 when other similar cards score in 1400 range. </TEXT>

Not a daily gamer the main purpose is to drive a triple monitor setup for CAD and graphics work with a few hours Borderland 2 and similar. Other cards happily considered.

<TEXT> In an earlier post I mentioned that I'd been an F1 for the better part of four decades and that this period included Mansell vs Prost, Senna vs Prost, Hakkinen vs Schumacher, Villeneuve vs Pironi, Jones vs Reutemann, Hill vs. Schumacher and much more.

Some of my favorite moments are [Mansell carrying Senna](http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1991_mans_asenn_silv.jpg) over the finish line in the 1991 British Grand Prix, [Hakkien overtaking Schui at Spa in 2000](http://youtu.be/-eE3gCy5zvM) and Lauda's title deciding 11th to 2nd comeback drive at [Estoril in 1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Portuguese_Grand_Prix)

What are your favorite memories of seasons past? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why prize money distribution won't solve F1's problems </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-08 18:23:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Many people think that distribution of money is to blame for the troubles on the F1 grid. This is a brief explanation of how the money actually works (and why even distribution wouldn't make much difference to the mid-field teams).

The profit is split 60/40 in favor of the teams (63% of 1.18 billion in 2012 and around 60% of 1.4 billion in 2013). The remainder is then split again into two types of payment and distributed among the 11 teams after Ferrari receive an ex-gratia payment ( this was $17.5 million in 2013).

- Category 1 payments which are shared EQUALLY if you finish inside the top 10 for 3 years in a row.
- Category 2 payments which are based on racing performance but require being in the top 10 WCC at the end of the season.

**2013 Distribution**

- In 2013 10 teams received $34.12 million in Category 1 payments. 

- Marusia didn't get anything because it had not yet had three seasons in the top 10. 
- Caterham didn't get any Category 2 money because it was outside the top 10. 


- Of the teams allegedly in trouble now Sauber got $58 million, Williams $51.2 million, Force India $64.8 million, Lotus $71.62 million. 


- Of the bankrupt teams Marussia got $13.6 million, and Caterham $34.12 million.


**Equal shares**

If the fund had been shared equally each team would have received $62 million - which is not enough to make a serious difference to Sauber, Force India or Williams - in-fact Force India and Lotus would have received LESS.

This is a big difference for the bottom two teams, but not much difference for the mid-field ones. F1 teams don't go under for the lack of a few million, they go under for the lack of tens of millions.

**2013 Prize Money List** 

- Red Bull $98.97m 

- Mercedes $88.72 

- Ferrari $96m 

- Lotus $71.62m 

- McLaren $68.22m 

- Force India $64.8m 

- Sauber $58m 

- Toro Rosso $54.6m 

- Williams $51.2m 

- Marussia $13.6m 

- Caterham $34.12m


To provide some idea of costs, Caterham is spending $60 million a year, Mercedes is spending $300 million. HAAS is entering in 2016 with a planned first season budget of around $200 million.

The real problem is costs, and even then this only applies to teams that don't have any other underlying business backing the team. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Worth upgrading a single processor 2009 Mac Pro 4,1? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-17 12:47:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've wanted a genuine Mac to replace my somewhat unreliable Triple Monitor Hackintosh for some time, and I've been looking at 2012 Mac Pro's for around 1300.

However I found a 2009 4,1 2.66 GHz Quad Core Xeon/8Mb/GT 120 512Mb at a second hand store for 249, knowing they sell for 4 - 600 on eBay I snapped it up. 

It benchmarks  around 8000, my existing system is around 12500. Because its the single core model the only economic upgrades right now are to the 4 core Westmere 3.33 W3580 and an NVIDIA GTX 780 6GB which come in at around 450 which means it will loosely match my Hackintosh minus USB3 and SATA 6Gb. 

An upgrade to the 12 core model comes in at 500 with the graphics card and processor that tops out at 1050, at which point I may as well have bought the 2012 model which is better in some respects.

Main pro is that it gives me a genuine Mac to fill in the gap while I save for a 2013 Mac Pro or better. Main con is the loss of SATA 6Gb and USB 3.0.
