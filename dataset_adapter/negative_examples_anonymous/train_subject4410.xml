<TEXT> I need a list of movies similar to Kingsman: The Secret Service. A little late to this party, I know, but I just watched it last night and thought it was awesome. I'm looking for movies shot in a similar way and with that same kind of over-the-top-but-completely-awesome feel to it. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, because basketball is the only players league. People love rooting for individuals way more than they love rooting for teams. People naturally are drawn towards a human being over a jersey. And the way the NFL is being completely overhauled because of health issues and baseball keeps declining because it's boring as hell, basketball will definitely take over. the worldwide fan base is growing astronomically and that will be a big factor as well. 

these next summer Olympics will prove how big basketball is around the world </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you were given the ability to create the perfect superhero movie, what superheroes would you choose to put in it? What villains? And who would you pick to play those characters? What's the storyline?

In this experiment, there are no character rights rules. Any character is usable. DC/Marvel cross over? Go for it. 

I want to know what the absolute best superhero movie could be from the story to the actors chosen to play the characters.  </TEXT>

For everyone saying "well they didn't take their decision lightly" well duh. If you were thinking about killing a baby that has been growing inside of you, you'd think about it a little too. 

If you wouldn't kill the baby when it's born, as soon as it becomes a human in everyone's eyes and you can see its little face and hands and its crying in your arms, then why is it suddenly okay to do it a month earlier? 2, 3, 5 months earlier? It's not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody knows. No one asks. Once their told "you're fine" people go on their merry way. 
I know a doctor who used to study under a cancer specialist in California. she said that this guy unlocked the cure for cancer in the pancreas of a pig. had years of studies and proof that it worked, and once the guy tried to publish a work or whatever it's called on it, guy gets taken out and his place gets ransacked. coincidence? curing disease and helping people doesn't make money and the government knows it. all I'm saying is, if it is government mandated that everyone get vaccinated, in today's corrupt governmental system, I want no part of it. and, the medical industry is just as corrupt as the government under which it serves. 

I just don't trust anybody, man </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's not about protecting your kids for them. it's only about money. if you went and got an MRI today, more than likely they'd tell you everything's fine. when in reality, you could have a treatable problem forming inside that won't manifest for 6+ months. why don't they tell you? because treating/curing it doesn't make as much money as waiting until it manifests and then trying to control it. 

it's all about money. always has been, always will be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spell check got me there. But you used "there" when you should have used "their", forgot the "e" in "use", didn't punctuate that whole sentence properly either, you used "then" when you should have used "than", and you said "as" instead of "has".  So you don't get to call me an idiot either, jackass. 

And as for all the BS proclamations you declared fact, you're wrong. It's actually not true that he juiced in high school. That's a myth. He didn't lose a lot of weight because of steroid use or whatever the fuck you're trying to say (you need help on sentence structure because you make no sense sometimes), he lost weight because of all the things in his DIET he cut out. He was trying to be quicker and lighter on his feet, as he has said many times, and at the beginning of the season didn't feel like himself, as he has said many times, so he switched back to his old meal plan and workout routine to start gaining weight back. Thus, all the back and knee problems coming out of nowhere because he was doing what he usually does in the summer, during the season. Therefore, he took a 2 week break to heal from his injuries and came back fresh. 

Ignorant people who assume the only way an athlete can be good at something is by using steroids or performance enhancers just really suck. It's possible, believe it or not, that you can realize your full potential by eating right, taking care of your body, and working hard. I know, foreign thought right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Warriors won't make it back. Didn't have to face a single legit point guard in their entire playoff run. A healthy Pat Beverly in their way, or Chris Paul, or Tony Parker who Curry has to guard would completely change their dynamic. I think the West is gonna be wide open again. 
Pierce is out of Washington, so they don't have a chance. Chicago just isn't good outside of Jimmy buckets and he can't win a series by himself. Atlanta is gonna be in the mix in the Easy but I just don't see them as a strong team when it comes down to it. I think the Bucks are coming, the Celtics are coming, a healthy Bosh puts the Heat in the playoffs but they aren't much. Cavs are a lock, in my book.  </TEXT>

In honestly not as worried about those guys because they're shooters. and it's a make or miss league. you live with those. it's the draymond cuts and back doors for dunks or iggy fastbreaks or Shaun Livingston post ups on smaller guards that can kill us, in my opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been a Lebron James die-hard follower since '06 because that was the first year I watched basketball. Over the past decade of watching him play, and especially the past 5 years or so, I've learned many things about the way he plays and approaches a playoff series. Game 4s, historically, are his rest game. He doesn't take them off per-say, but he doesn't come out guns blazing like other games. This isn't an accident however, because he has a plan. I think it is a psychological trick he uses to get the other team over confident. because wen game 5 rolls around, he turns it on. he looks different, has a new look in his eyes, new energy. he finds a way to get it done. people counted this team out, then when he started to dominate jumped on the bandwagon, then when they lost and tied the series, dove head first off the bandwagon back onto the Warriors side. What I know is this: Lebron the Underdog is one of the scariest Lebrons you'll ever see. and now that he is back to that spot, look out. I AM CONFIDENT BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME AT THE KING YOU BEST NOT MISS. IT'S MEANT TO BE. I CAN FEEL IT  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They'll still trap the PnR with Curry, but instead of leaving Lee open on the roll or pop, they'll rotate everybody over a man. So, big man on the opposite side comes over to cover Lee, guy in the corner slides to cover the big man who covered Lee, and you leave the ball side corner man open. if the pass goes there, it's ball side so one of the two trapping Curry can simply close out quickly and recover and you're back in your defensive set. it's not a hard offensive set to counter against, they just didn't have time to do it in Game 3.  </TEXT>

But if you're gonna throw up 15 3s and miss 13, you have to be held accountable. If you're going to air ball a go ahead jumper, you have to be ridiculed. That's how MVPs are supposed to be treated. If Lebron James can score 44 and miss a game winner by inches and get roasted for it, Curry most definitely can when he air balls it on top of a god awful night. This isn't even a conversation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't mean he didn't have any plays at all. I just meant that his motion Princeton offense that they threw out in December doesn't work with a ball dominant guy. so the sets he does draw up are to get Lebron a mismatch on the post or a shooter coming up off of down screens. nothing that involves all 5 guys in positions to score like the Warriors have. that's all I meant. Lebron definitely needs to chill on the ISOs tho </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah for real. TT had 2 points. He doesn't usually do that. He missed some bunnies that he usually makes. JR won't shoot that poorly again, Shump won't either. JJ will knock a couple down. even Delly could hit something. I'm extremely disappointed about the Kyrie situation just for Kyrie's sake bc the dude plays so damn hard, but I still think this is a very winnable series. Lebron just has to go back to that "get everybody else going first" role he's played in the past and we got these guys. Keep the faith everyone </TEXT>

<TEXT> the JR comment is just wrong. he's been consistently hot basically since he put on a cavs uni. and the warriors walked into the finals just like the Cavs did. Just because they played teams with better records, doesnt mean they played better teams. The Pels wouldve sold their souls to just win a game in that series, the Grizz never had a real shot bc they couldnt guard steph and he was just off in the games they lost. also, bigs-focused teams are a good matchup for them. and the rockets had a 37 year old spot up shooting guard playing the point and guarding steph curry. and josh smith, JOSH SMITH, started. 

Also, Cavs defensively are better without Love in the lineup. So him being out favors the Cavs defensively. This will be a much better series than 90% of people think.

Shane Battier started his "Battioke" Karaoke night and it was always in like March so they got a night off and got a break and came back with a hot streak. This stuff happens all the time. You just dont see it reported about because Lebron isnt on every team and every coach isnt coaching Lebron, putting his every action into the spotlight. These kinds of moves and very strategically done and typically end with a positive result.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly don't like Kyrie on the floor at all guarding their starting group. I guess him guarding Barnes is the best option, but Kerr is smart. He'll just post up Barnes and work Kyrie 5 possessions in a row until we do something about it. Hopefully Ky can hold his own for 8-10 minutes before the Delly sub can come in and rotate everybody back in place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hospital was supposed to blow when the Joker hit the trigger the first time when he was walking away from it in The Dark Knight. It legitimately malfunctioned and he stayed in character and improved the whole scene from then on out. It turned out way better than the original would have in my opinion too. Showed how great Heath did with that role. Also, there was a camera rigged in the bus (not sure if they thought of using that footage or not) but he stayed in character the entire ride. Thought that all was pretty awesome </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rings argument is so flawed in a team game. It takes an entire organization to win a championship, not one player. That is what I think Lebrons greatest ability is, to completely flip a franchise around. No other player in history, simply by their individual presence, could turn a team into a Finals threat. If you put Lebron on the Knicks or Magic, they're a threat immediately. No one else can do that </TEXT>

<TEXT> I say you give the bottom 5 records the same percentage chance to win that too pick. Say, 11%. Then give the other 9 less, split into 3's. For example, 6 through 8 would have an 8% chance, 9 to 11 has 5%, and 12-14 have 2%. You can change that into whatever increments you want but that's just the first i thought of that equalled 100. Anyway, you have more even chances across the board, it doesn't eliminate tanking all together, but it doesn't incentivize being the worse team in the league either. I also think you draw for every drafting position, not just top 3. I dont know how logical this is, but I think it helps reduce the need to tank for some teams.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There isn't a single defender on the Wizards that is as good as Lebron, JR, and Shump. Hell, even Delly can defend full-court just to put pressure on the ball. So I don't see back door cuts and off ball screens being an issue simply because we have better overall defenders on our squad. Kyrie will have issues though and I fully acknowledge that. I guess I'm just assuming Delly gets more minutes than usual this series? I don't know. That's a big question mark. But as far as TT, Moz, and JJ go on defending Horford and Paul, I just don't see many issues coming up that can't be effectively game-planned for. TT can guard either of them on the post or outside. JJ can take Paul if he is playing more outside with another big in the middle and Moz can definitely hold his own against Horford. Call me optimistic, but I just don't see anything that the Hawks do and think that we don't have a counter for it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wasn't trivializing. That's just how you talk about basketball. You state what the opposing team does offensively, you tell why you think your team can either, guard against it well and why or, why they cannot. So get outta here with your douchebag approach to responding to my opinion of how the series will go. You can respond with your opinion without being an ass. But bruh, pin downs are easy to guard. Off ball screens are easy to guard when you have smart and quick athletes like JR and Shump on the wings. And, like I said, TT and Moz can handle the post actions because they are both great defenders. And I dont give a shit how much film Carrol watches the next few days, he isn't going to magically get bigger and stronger and quicker and D up Lebron effectively. And if you think the Hawks can beat a Lebron James led basketball team 3 out of 6 times to force a game 7, you're delusional.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree with the "offense that won't let up" idea simply because their offense is so unbelievably easy to guard. It's a ton of off-ball screens and pin-downs, back door cuts, and high-low action with the posts. TT and Moz can handle all of the post actions and they've proven that. JR and Shump are more than capable at staying with Korver and Schroeder/Carrol/ whatever other wings they play. Kyrie and Delly can more than handle Teague and Schroeder PG wise and Lebron can guard whoever the hell he wants and lock em down. Defensively, I'm not worried. I just don't want Lebron to keep hoisting jumpers up all series if they aren't falling. However, there isn't a Jimmy Butler caliber defender on that team so I don't know how many jumpers he is going to want to take anyway. Cavs in 5 is my prediction. Remember, the Hawks almost lost to the Nets in a playoff series. hahahhahaha </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bruh, Lebron shot 8 for 25. 7 TO's. that's not a season average. Kyrie cant jump or sprint with one foot. that's not something that happened in the regular season. dont try to act like theyre playing normal. if Lebron and Kyrie play like the duo theyve been all year, this isnt a game. 
And I'm perfectly content being down 1-2 because we have the best player on that planet on our squad. Also, cleveland doesnt have a home court advantage. their home crowd was basically terrible so those first two were neutral site games as far as im
concerned. 
In the end, being down 1 to 2 without a 17 and 10 guy, without a play making shooter for the first two, and with a plethora of injuries isn't the worst it can be. I have faith in King James.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> are you? sounds like a pretty biased take on officiating from your end too, boss. they called a foul to make up for the missed goaltend, by the way. watch it back, literally nobody touched him. but, all that aside, yall won the game. congrats. yall got 50 from your top two, we got 38. we got out rebounded badly. had basically zero fast break points. got out scored by 15 on 2nd chance points. and we still only lost on a hail mary. im content with that. the question is, are you? just hope it doesnt scare you that Lebron and Kyrie have played like complete shit for 3 games and it's still a close series. we'll see what happens when they get it going </TEXT>

I actually wrote a paper about it this semester, and I just basically like seeing life from different perspectives and trying to understand from a distance what people are going through bc i have no idea what that life is like.

<TEXT> I dont want this theory to hinge on Bruce pulling something Batman-ish out of his ass. I think Nolan showed Selina Kyle in that scene just to mess with the audience and make us question everything we just saw, exactly like the end of Inception. I just find it extremely hard to believe that Bruce either got the bomb out far enough from the city and somehow escaped the blast radius himself in that small amount of time, or used the auto pilot to take the bomb out which would mean that everything we see of him in the aircraft is fake. Just doesnt make sense. Makes a lot more sense for him to sacrifice himself to protect the city he has dedicated his life to protect and for Nolan to throw Bruce and Selina in that last scene just to fuck with us. For me, that was Alfred seeing what he always wished he would see every time he went there. Completely in his head.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mike Miller is the X factor in our playoff run from here on out. I saw it in Miami, I see it now. If he can hit 3's like he has in playoffs of old and if he can defend like he has in the past, he's a game changer. He is a guy who has been through it all before with Lebron and knows where he needs to be at critical points in a game. He's 6 foot 8 so he can guard some 4's who tend to stay outside (mirotic, for example) and he can rebound the ball too. If Blatt actually plays him, he can genuinely affect games.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mike Mill is gettin pt this series. Lebron knows who he is in the playoffs (game 5 in '12, 7 3's, shoeless 3 against the spurs) and he's is gonna make sure he plays. The only issue i see is our starting lineup. we have to match pau and noah so tt and moz have to start. cant spread the floor with that. so we have to wait for the bulls to put a smaller guy in before we can have a lineup that suits our strengths. in other words, we cant make the first move. we'll be adjusting to what they do instead of the other way around. still think we got em tho </TEXT>

<TEXT> basketball reference.com. literally showed it on screen during the game. in the NBA, when a dislocated shoulder is listed as the cause of injury to a player, the average number of games missed is 27 games. However, I am not saying Kevin will be out for 27 games. I am saying that, on average, that's how many games are missed by players during the regular season. and yes, if there's no ligament or tendon damage then of course it wont be that long.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't tell me 14 pts a game from Wade on a bum knee is contributing. And I never questioned Bosh's pick and roll defense. I agree, he is excellent at that. Guarding big men, however, is another story. He got cooked by Roy Hibbert(!!!) 2 years in a row before *Udonis *Haslem was put on him and shut him down. And he couldn't guard Duncan, or Splitter for that matter, two years in a row. 

All of those things aside, when I say Lebron carried them, I'm not wrong. He led the team is scoring, rebounds, assists, and steals for nearly 4 full years. He was the best defender in the league, regardless of who got the award, for 2-3 of those years. so he had to guard the likes of DRose, KD, Tony Parker, Paul Pierce, Paul George, etc. all while leading the offense in every statistical category there is. Yes, DWade contributed at times and yes, CB helped spread the floor and in p r situations defensively, but outside of that, it was '09/'10 Cavaliers all over again. 

But, I greatly appreciate you actually contributing information and making a logical argument. Most people just throw aimless comments out there and hope they stick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i disagree. i also think it's ridiculous to still be upset with him about that. that's the only questionable thing he has done since he was 17 years old. he is a stand-up guy who has always gone above and beyond for his community. and even when he was in Miami, you knew he always wanted to be back home. to not forgive him for essentially going off to college before realizing he was meant to stay home is just immature.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uhh... he did. Just because he was getting, what, 22 and 10 before he had the lung issues doesn't mean he isn't past his prime. He was getting twice as many shots and was the unquestionable focus of the offense every time down the floor this season. You're bound to have better numbers when you get twice the shots. But prime Bosh? That was in 2011 when he would routinely get 30 and 15. When Lebron and Wade were out, he would drop 40+ and single-handedly win games. You won't see that from him again </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just want a realistic spider-man. Like, why is he so witty and funny? Didn't Robin Williams say the funniest people are the ones hurting the most or something like that? Make Uncle Ben's death dark. The whole thing dark. Like The Dark Knight dark. I want him to resort to humor because he's depressed and fight crime to try to *AVENGE his uncle's death. I dont want the same old high school stuff we've seen. Reinvent it. Make it new. I want him to do bad things to criminals because he's so angry. I want dark humor at first until he realizes what he actually needs to do to with his ability. I want Captain America to be integrated somehow and sort of take him under his wing and show him how to be responsible with his abilities. I want Captain to tell him "With great power comes great responsibility," echoing what Uncle Ben told him previously, only this time it actually clicks. Finally, I want him to become an *Avenger. But only because he has earned it and struggled through the pain to become one.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Has there ever been a player close to, equal to, or better than Lebron at making players around him better? JR's resurgence and emergence as a weapon on this team, I believe, is completely the Lebron effect. Like, him and Bron can go off together and just dominate a game as a duo. He does the same thing with Kyrie and did the same thing with Wade or Bosh. Even back to Mo Williams when he was an all star, that was all the Lebron duo effect. Takes a 33 win team to number one in vegas odds to win the chip the day he signs... single-handedly changes franchises. Just curious to see what you guys think! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Barney transformed into the guy he is now after he found out his girlfriend from the coffee shop was cheating on him, how did him and his brother turn into the wingman duo they were in season 2? Barney said they were raised in the same home and had the same values and James getting married was him turning his back on them and him... So how does that work? </TEXT>
