I don't mean to be offensive but I just can't seem to understand the line of thinking behind the view. 

Feedom of expression exists for the things we don't like, the ones we like don't need protection. I'm personally against any type of hijab but I realize that it's just not my call to make. It's their body and they should be able to decide what to wear. I just simply don't understand how people who say they stand for freedom want to ban certain types of clothing from some events. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

The Over-policing of Dominican Hair
Just recently, Morgan Miller published an article for American Quarterly, decrying her experience as an African-American woman with natural hair in the Dominican Republic. Morgan traveled to the Dominican Republic expecting a respite from the racism she experienced in her native United States. She arrived in a poor tropical island fully unaware of her own country's imposition of a political pigmentocracy vis--vis their training and backing of dictator Rafael Trujillo. 

Robert Crassweller in Trujillo: The Life and Times of a Caribbean Dictator writes of racial relations before Trujillo's rise to power. Crassweller stresses that in the Dominican Republic, the color line barely existed (149). A preference for good hair was the limit of racial awareness and indeed it was not unusual for a very dark man to be successful and receive full public acceptance in the highest circles of public life. Crassweller further adds that the ancient hostilities between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were national and public, not private and personal. Trujillo, whose own grandmother was Haitian, found it more convenient to antagonize the two peoples in order to pose as the savior of one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seeking Refuge

"Now that Bitcoin exists, we hope that Greek workers and merchants can use it to protect their income through this crisis."
- BitPay business development manager Pablo Magro.
To fight inflation, Latin Americans have historically stored their wealth in American dollars. The increasing restrictions some countries have placed on buying dollars have left these citizens financially vulnerable.

In Argentina, even though government restrictions were somewhat relaxed after the peso experienced a sudden drop in value in 2014, those who are approved to buy dollars are limited to purchasing just 20% of their income, capping their monthly savings at $2,000.

Getting this approval is a cumbersome process, leaving most Argentines with a higher restriction barrier to exchange their local currency. However, the numbers are rising from $39.2m p/day bought in June to $60m p/day bought in July, forcing the government to tighten the restrictions.

Extreme restrictions on currency exchange have led to the emergence of a black market specifically for trading pesos for dlar blue, American dollars with an exchange rate that runs about 50% higher than the official exchange rate.

Acquiring dollars this way is illegal and risky, so Argentines seeking to protect their savings often buy ADRs (American Depository Receipts), local bonds denominated in dollars, gold, silver, and other commodities that are traded on local and international stock exchanges.

No Bank Account? No Problem.

News of bank closures in Greece in the past month have sparked panic, then bank runs, leaving many Greek citizens without regular access to their bank accounts.

For Latin Americans, this situation is already too familiar. Among Latin America's 600 million inhabitants, more than 60% are unbanked, meaning they have no access to bank accounts.

Despite the obvious economic need, most financial institutions are unable to serve this unbanked population.

Fortunately, purchasing and using bitcoin does not require a bank account. All it takes is just a mobile phone, which 70% of Latin Americans happen to have. In contrast to the banking system, the Bitcoin network operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It presents an immediate, accessible solution to receive wages and securely store savings at very low cost, with no additional resources or hardware required.

Entrepreneurs and companies have already begun to make bitcoin solutions available to consumers in the region. Belize's Advanced Cash is particularly significant example, accepting bitcoin payments for top-ups to its popular digital wallets and prepaid cards which are used throughout Latin America. This mainstream integration of bitcoin payments is allowing both banked and unbanked customers to secure their savings in the cloud. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the past couples didnt have a choice about whether or not to stay together; they were forced to by circumstance and the need for survival. We glamorize marriages from the past by pretending that people voluntarily stayed together, instead of acknowledging that the majority of people didnt have alternatives. In fact, many marriages in the past were not only highly dysfunctional, but highly abusive. So feeling nostalgic for the perfect marriages of the past is like feeling nostalgic for the time when money grew on trees. </TEXT>

she basically describes how she gave up her own desires in order to make her husband happy. She also says that if she were to do things over again, she would guard the things that she enjoys and the things that make her feel like herself.19


Women do give up much of who they are, but the reason is to accomplish their dream. Yet after they get what they want, women forget this fact and mistakenly think that they have given up and sacrificed in order to make their husbands happy.

I agree with Armstrong that marriage is the greatest conspiracy in modern history. However, in truth men dont fare any better than women, and to believe anything else is merely to buy into the conspiracy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The fundamental error Chandler makes in this video is that the "unloading" of the upper floors' weight on the lower half only occurs until the the upper floors impact it. The impact, if you want to use the "block" analogy , is much greater that the original static load and it impacts on only one floor in this simple model. If this implact is greater than the floors ability to withstand it (it's dynamic load rating) then the floor will come apart. (I'm not arguing the model, as it's kind of silly, just that even if you try to use it, his conclusions ignore this point.)

Try this simple math - let the upper 13 floors weigh one pound each, so the weight pressing down on the "lower block" is 13 pounds on 9/10/2001. The detached upper block accelerates on 9/11/2991 for 12 (distance between floors) feet at 18 feet per second (Chandler's video) so the terminal velocity of the block is roughly10 feet per second. F=1/2 MV^2, so the thirteen blocks exert an impact of (13*10*10)/2=650 lbs on the top floor of the block. If this is greater than the design load of the floor - or its weakest links, then it will come apart at those points. Note the huge difference between 13 and 650 in terms of load. The next floor impact is even worse as the constant acceleration means that the velocity is greater (from Chandler) and so the force is even greate by the SQUARE of the velocity (and the mass might be up by a bit too). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was kind of shocked at the number of kids we had that believed this shit when I was studying civil engineering. That probably explains why they got C's or D's in dynamics though!

I'll elaborate slightly. I don't build or design buildings. I build roads; they're what I know and am good at. However, I have taken two structural analysis and design courses, as well as a steel design course, so I imagine that puts me at or above 98% of the general public when it comes to understanding how the towers fell. 

Here goes; when you build a building there's basically two types of loadings you'll design for: static and dynamic. Static loadings are the loads on a structure that don't change; desks, computers, filing cabinets, the actual weight of the building itself, stuff like that. Dynamic loadings are a bit trickier as they can move; people, water from rain/snow on the roof, wind, seismic, etc. You get the idea. 

I'm not certain on the Factor of Safety (FOS) used for the Towers' design, but let's assume it was 2. What that means is in a static situation, all other things being equal and there being no dynamic forces acting on the building (a perfect classroom scenario, obviously not real world), you'd basically be able to stack one tower on top of the other and it would be able to support it. 

It gets trickier with dynamic loading because in theory you could have all of the weight focused on a minute point, which you obviously couldn't design for as it would require truly massive structural members to support so dynamic FOS is, let's say, 1.1. 

Once the first floor started to accelerate downwards, the was nothing that could stop the floor below it from failing immediately after the dynamic load hit it. Now you've got two floors falling, then three, and so on. For the buildings to be sturdy enough to handle a moving weight like that falling even 10 feet would require gargantuan beams. I'm taking beams that are 4 feet tall (looking at it where it makes an "I") and weigh several hundred pounds per foot. Something that heavy could not support itself. 

Another thing to mention is the whole steel beams thing. Everyone needs to shut the hell up about "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" bullshit. It didn't have to melt the beams. All it had to do was weaken them. Steel loses 70% of its tensile strength at only 25-30% of it's melting point, which was definitely reached during the fires. For those of you playing along at home, that would mean the building would have had to have been built with an FOS of 4 or more, which is not feasible financially, and quite possibly structurally. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that our quality control standards in the 70's weren't nearly as good as they are today. Is venture as well that the quality of the materials used aren't as good as they are now. 

I know only a few will see this, but I hope it might help you explain it to the layman that believes all of this bullshit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Acts of civil disobedience are in line with the principles of equality that governed my life  I felt I had an obligation to use my skills for justice and bring the truth to light, he said.

But Judge Preska disagreed with Hammond that his hacktivism was a form of civil disobedience.

"These were not the actions of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, John Adams or even Daniel Ellsberg [who handed over the Pentagon Papers], said Preska in closing. In his own words, Mr. Hammond had a stated goal of creating maximum mayhem.

Among other items, Hammond was found guilty of the Dec. 2011 hack into the computer systems of global intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor. Speaking about that hack, Preska had equally strong words.

His goal was, citing Hammond's own words at the time, to destroy the target, hoping for bankruptcy, collapse." </TEXT>

<TEXT> **super alpha postnationalism FAQ**

-founded as a counter-jerk to the prevailing western attitude- against foreigners, against outsourcing, against immigrants, which i believe is mostly founded on a "fuck you got ours" 

ie: "socialist" norway, 1 trillion $ oil fund, huge landmass, still no room for immigrants. australias white immigration policy, americas 10 year waiting lists etc.

-veganism says species:discrimination, we declare some species lower and then eat them. the same thing happens with our global caste system.

-labor is divided. the illegal immigrants are used as a bargaining chip to push down the wages for the local people, and the answer is NOT to join forces with your employer against the foreign labor

-US vs THEM mentality, ww3, hitler. nationalism leads to war over scarce resources. dehumanizing other nations peoples and demanding your nation is #1 etc. 

**WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF POSTNATIONALISM?**

united globe, be it under global government or what. people can move freely around. indians and americans and africans are equal. 

Dont just Take my word for it, look at the top 5 all time posts:

<TEXT> An argument made in the film is that there is no reason why the Federal Reserve System should have a monopoly on the U.S. money supply. The film asserts that "America got along just fine before the Federal Reserve came into existence." This leads the film to the question of why the Federal Reserve System was created. The film contends that the U.S. Congress has no control or oversight over the Fed, and hence has no control over the value of U.S. money. The film argues that Congressional control over the value of money is required by Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. The phrase in question (clause 5) states that the United States Congress shall have the power "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin..." The film includes a call to action to abolish the Federal Reserve. In 2007, the Boston Globe stated that Congressman Ron Paul, "says he doesn't agree with all the film's arguments, but he says the film had 'a huge impact' on the support his campaign is drawing",[2] a reference to Paul's presidential bid in 2007 and 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I ask for a nickel-free earring because I noticed that nickel causes a rash and inflammation on my ear, no one hysterically accuses me of being "anti-earring". When you are evaluating the messages here, which you must do for the sake of your child's health, think about this:


--98% of people who want to get thimerasol out of vaccines are NOT "Anti-Vaccine" they want vaccines to be safer


--And yet, you will notice that there are hysterical straw men arguments made accusing people who want safer vaccines to be 'anti-vaccine'.
Start there. Why would ANYONE slam the parent of an autistic or brain-injured child and misrepresent their story and their wish unless they had an either religious fervor about vaccines or a financial interest or a desparate wish to hide the truth? If they are really concerned that people will stop vaccinating if they learn that vaccines have dangerous ingredients, then why not join us in making vaccines safer? There is no explanation for their rabid denial that poisons in vaccines are not a good idea, and their continual misrepresenation of this. Excpet a desparate wish to avoid blame or financial loss. Or simply a desparate wish to be correct.

 But what motivates parents of vaccine injured children and environmentalists like RFK Jr? Common sense and dozens of studies you can find in his book. And a wish to never see another babbling child anywhere in the world, become silent, as so many parents of mercury -poisoned have. It's a poison. Its in vaccines. Get it out! Enough said!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed, despite the often-decried undercurrent of Social Darwinism in Heinlein's science fiction, there also exists a significant dallying with transnational political organizations. Heinlein's idealism and pragmatism concerning international relations constantly temper each other, often producing entities that, if not necessarily ideals of charity and brotherhood, at least are not mindless predatory organisms but instead are commonsensical and neighborly. Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists.

 Heinlein's work with transnational organizations can be grouped into four main categories: the earlier, more idealistic novels such as Space Cadet (1948), which incorporate fairly successful transnational organizations that often attempt not only to keep the peace but to do other good as well, saving lives and protecting individual rights, all the while supported by generally democratic political infrastructures; the later, more cautiously internationalist novels exemplified by Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958) and Glory Road (1963), wherein organizations consciously limit themselves to an often more pragmatic peacekeeping; the infrequent warnings against governmental intrusion, like Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966); and, of course, the occasional pieces like Farmer in the Sky (1950) and Time for the Stars (1956), which merely employ some basically unexamined form of world government as a conventionalized science fictional backdrop. Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the "starry-eyed internationalists" who urged disarmament and who longed for a "world state" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.

Citizenship could be revoked if:

A person obtained, retained or resumed citizenship by false representation, fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances (for example, information that could have impacted his or her eligibility for citizenship or permanent residence).

And could be revoked from dual citizens if the person:
served as member of an armed force or organized armed group engaged in an armed conflict with Canada;
was convicted of treason, high treason, spying offences and sentenced to imprisonment for life; or
was convicted of a terrorism offence or an equivalent foreign terrorism conviction and sentenced to five years or more imprisonment. Note: Revocation on these grounds would only apply to persons with dual citizenship, to comply with Canada's obligations under the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

...


The vast majority of cases (those related to residence fraud, concealing criminal inadmissibility or identity fraud) are decided by the CIC Minister. More exceptional cases, such as those involving war crimes and crimes against humanity as well as cases regarding security, human or international rights violations and organized criminality, would instead be decided by the FC.

And therefore have a moral obligation to help those who have least contributed to the problem, and are most vulnerable to the risks, to adapt to climate change.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

<TEXT> White Americans are the biggest terror threat in the United States, according to a study by the New America Foundation. The Washington-based research organization did a review of terror attacks on US soil since Sept. 11, 2001 and found that most of them were carried out by radical anti-government groups or white supremacists.
Almost twice as many people have died in attacks by right-wing groups in America than have died in attacks by Muslim extremists. Of the 26 attacks since 9/11 that the group defined as terror, 19 were carried out by non-Muslims. Yet there are no white Americans languishing inside the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. And there are no drones dropping bombs on gatherings of military-age males in the country's lawless border regions.
Attacks by right-wing groups get comparatively little coverage in the news media. Most people will struggle to remember the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed six people in 2012. A man who associated with neo-Nazi groups carried out that shooting. There was also the married couple in Las Vegas who walked into a pizza shop and murdered two police officers. They left a swastika on one of the bodies before killing a third person in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Such attacks are not limited to one part of the country. In 2011, two white supremacists went on a shooting spree in the Pacific Northwest, killing four people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given the kind of low bandwidth conversation we often have about immigrants ('assimilation' vs. 'multiculturalism'); the title could be a touch misleading to today's audience. The author is arguing that there is not an indigenous American culture (Indians aside) and that immigrant cultures have helped to create a fertile, pioneering spirit that is the genius of the US. What is believed to be indigenous is a shallow Anglophilia and a coarse transient popular culture. Forcing immigrants to adopt these "rudimentary" characteristics would lead to stagnation in the US.
"It is not the Jew who sticks proudly to the faith of his fathers and boasts of that venerable culture of his who is dangerous to America, but the Jew who has lost the Jewish fire and become a mere elementary, grasping animal. It is not the Bohemian who supports the Bohemian schools in Chicago whose influence is sinister, but the Bohemian who has made money and has got into ward politics. Just so surely as we tend to disintegrate these nuclei of nationalistic culture do we tend to create hordes of men and women without a spiritual country, cultural outlaws, without taste, without standards but those of the mob." </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are in there, often unnoticed. The words that have become part of everyday English. Loot, nirvana, pyjamas, shampoo and shawl; bungalow, jungle, pundit and thug.

What are the roots, and routes, of these Indian words? How and when did they travel and what do their journeys into British vernacular  and then the Oxford English Dictionary  tell us about the relationship between Britain and India?

Long before the British Raj  before the East India Company acquired its first territory in the Indian subcontinent in 1615  South Asian words from languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Malayalam and Tamil had crept onto foreign tongues. One landmark book records the etymology of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases. Compiled by two India enthusiasts, Henry Yule and Arthur C Burnell, Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India was published in 1886. The poet Daljit Nagra described it as not so much an orderly dictionary as a passionate memoir of colonial India. Rather like an eccentric Englishman in glossary form. </TEXT>

The researchers also conducted brain scans of participants before and after the training regiments, finding that at resting state, participants in the meditation group had increased activity in the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex brain areas. These regions are part of the brain network related to self-control capacity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While all developing countries  from the least developed to middle-income  can celebrate accomplishments in their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), critical gaps remain. Despite vast diversities, African, Least Developed, Landlocked, Small Island and Middle-Income Countries share, to varying degrees, many common challenges on their path to equitable sustainable development. These include: poverty, growing inequality, hunger, food insecurity, improving public health and education, providing social protection, youth unemployment, migration, urbanization, changing age structures, growing pressures on resources, and climate change. Some countries also face conflict situations or post-conflict fragilities. In many, the globalization of inequality and social exclusion is leading to increased social unrest and dissatisfaction with current models and trends of development. In various cases, these challenges are aggravated and perpetuated by weaknesses in democratic governance and institutional capacity, weak infrastructure, debt burdens, economic crisis, corruption, funding shortfalls, and declines in development cooperation.

This brief focuses on three key pillars for achieving social, economic and environmentally sustainable development:

Advancing the human rights of women and girls and gender equality;
The rights and empowerment of adolescents and youth;
Sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.
These are essential, cross-cutting foundations for a post-2015 people-centred and planet-sensitive development agenda. They are mutually-reinforcing prerequisites for progress, relevant for all countries regardless of their stage of development. They are also smart, effective and cost-saving investments with multiple payoffs across a range of development objectives.

A human rights-based and holistic approach to sustainable development must address multiple dimensions of discrimination and exclusion, including for women and young people as the two largest demographic groups in the world facing inequality and insecurity. Sexual and reproductive health problems  which are preventable  take a huge toll on lives, families, productivity, economies and public budgets. They entrench poverty and erode development prospects, and represent costs and burdens that can and must be lifted. The limited investments in these key areas is a major reason why many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have not been achievedan important lesson for crafting the post-2015 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The observed descent time of the upper 18 stories of the north face of WTC 7 (the floors clearly visible in the video evidence) was 40 percent greater than the computed free fall time. A more detailed analysis of the descent of the north face found three stages: (1) a slow descent with acceleration less than that of gravity that corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns at the lower floors, (2) a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s, and (3) a decreasing acceleration as the north face encountered resistance from the structure below.

<TEXT> Even though the lower undamaged structure was designed to be able to handle the upper damaged 18 stories, this is only true in a static sense. Once the loads became dynamic (due to gravity), the dynamic loads had already far exceeded the structural design limit and the failure had to propagate until all the energy is dissipated.

This is true for nearly every structure in existence, and certainly true for every skyscraper: once progressive collapse begins, it can't be stopped because the supporting structure below cannot handle the many multiplications of the load it was designed to support.

<TEXT> Small victory, but these insights also make it much more interesting in my opinion to watch other highly intelligent animals like whales and elephants. Here's a cool article[1] expanding on the point about matters of degree into areas where other animals might actually have cognitive capacities beyond ours.


Let's just say, our globe's legal systems have a hard enough time admitting all people have universal rights. It's going to take a lot more to change this pervasive mindset of human dominion over all species. Hell, we slaughter and imprison billions of animals for food every year; if we, as a society, can't even bring ourselves to stop eating them in every meal, what chance is there for anything even resembling rights? </TEXT>

Their are numerous links, pics and articles demonstrating a submarines ability to get in position, sink below a thermal layer and in complete silence launch a salvo of devastating weapons. The response from the carrier group would be immediate, total and savage but the sub is still invisible and depending on its next steps, stands a very real chance of surviving. Diesel Electrics and Subs using Air Propulsion drive shafts have long been discussed and studied to learn tactics to defend against. The Swedish navy 'rented' an entire Sub and crew to the U.S. Navy to work against, the six month tour ended up extending to two years such was the realisation that these subs were very dangerous to carriers and large capital ships

A carrier battlegroup is difficult but not impossible to attack. There is some vulnerability to submarines as well as cruise missiles that fly very low. The important thing to take into account, however, is that these weapons have fairly short ranges and are sophisticated enough that few adversaries posses them. The only "mid-ocean" risk would be from Russia (or a former Soviet country) that has a nuclear attack submarine. Non-nuclear submarines and cruise missiles will both operate within several  hundred miles of an enemy coast. The weapons of a carrier battlegroup are of sufficient range that they can stay outside of the range of these weapons and still attack the enemy.

Several countries have developed very quiet non-nuclear submarines. In a conflict, however, the ASW forces associated with a carrier battle group will be actively looking for these subs. The sub hunters are using combinations of active and passive sonar buoys, helicopters with dipped arrays, as well as other tools. While not every target can be defended like this, it is likely that a carrier battle group will be well defended.

Another commenter pointed out the risk of anti-ship missiles like the DF-21. There are several problems with those systems, not the least of which is that they would need to be targeted accurately against a moving target from a long distance away. Second, the ballistic variants look an awful lot like nuclear missiles, and so could lead to an inadvertent nuclear escalation.


**Aircraft carriers are a remnant of WWII and would not last long in a full-fledged conflict where modern technology is used**, but that is not their purpose today.  </TEXT>

the US fight against the Filipino "insurrectionists" at the turn of the century remains a blank spot to most Americans. There are some very good reasons for this. Most people don't like to be reminded that the US was an openly racist major power more interested in trade than in freeing the natives of the Philippines. It is disturbing to read about American heros like Teddy Roosevelt denigrating the "niggers" who inhabited the island, and soft-pedalling widespread torture by the US military (most notably the rather nasty 'water cure'). It is also interesting to read how many people did not value the islands that much themselves, but felt that they were needed to be our springboard to the China trade -- which was going to make everyone rich, of course! It took the Japanese empire at its worst to make the US look like a friend to many Filipinos, and this book tells why. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An excellent telling of a period that most Americans and Filipinos know little or nothing about. With America's new ownership of the Philippines, we were drawn into a second conflict once the Spanish were routed. The insurrectionist movement against America brought about a bloody and savage war that cost tens of thousands of lives. The third phase was the attempt to subdue the Moros, some of the toughest and most fearless warriors on the planet. The troops involved thought they would only be fighting Spanish regulars and then sent home. Rather, many spent years fighting in jungles and swamps against a clever and determined foe, and many were then shipped off to fight the Boxer's in China in 1900, only to be returned to battle the often fiendish inhabitants of places like Sibago Island, Jolo and Samar. A classic account and ranks with "Muddy Glory" and "Little Brown Brother" to name but a couple. There isn't much written about this conflict, but the information is out there. These lessons should have taught America about getting involved in smaller nations affairs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is also a study in racism; how allegedly "superior" Anglo-Saxons needed to "civilize" and "Christianize" the Filipinos, many of whom were Catholic. Overall, this book is a good primer about a shocking and somewhat vile episode in American history. High School history teachers in particular should read this book and include it in their lessons about the outcome of our "splendid little war" with Spain. It is a sad truth that as a result of this conflict, America did not seem to learn anything about the nature of guerilla warfare with a people fighting to be free of foreign control. Our failure to profit from this episode helped propel us into another such quagmire in Vietnam, a nation not too far from the site of our earlier fiasco in the Philippines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved. Similarly the US resorted to what are now called "War Crimes, "Crimes Against Humanity" and "Genocide" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented "concentration camps" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok ("mountain(s)" in Tagalog - source of our word "boondocks") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as "protective hamlets" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was "every able-bodied man" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone.
The Fil-Am war started when the Americans had promised, in writing, to free Filipinos from the Spanish to form a new Philippine nation under Filipino rule, and then reneged on the promise. The phrase "our little brown bothers" comes from this era as the excuse to break the agreement. The attitudes are summed up in political cartoons of the time: 1[1] , 2[2] and 3[3] . This really no different from attitudes prevalent today about arabs and muslims. We simply call the all "terrorists" as a direct substitute for "nxxxxx" as used in 1899. Nothing has changed.
Today the US does the equivalent when it drone attacks wedding parties and funerals or puts innocents in concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Camp X Ray to be killed and to attempt indoctrination which often failed. In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers).
Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to "achieve US policy" but the Muslim MILF/Huks BIEBER were. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They slowly began to realize that their major foe was not really the formally constituted, but in many ways ineffectual, Philippine Army; rather, it was the Filipino people, who, having finally gotten rid of the Spanish, were unrelentingly and implacably hostile to American imperialist designs. The implications of this understanding were fully realized only later and in the bloodiest manner imaginable. But as early as April 1899, General Shafter gave grisly portent to the future conduct of the war: "It may be necessary to kill half the Filipinos in order that the remaining half of the population may be advanced to a higher plane of life than their present semi-barbarous state affords."7

The American command had presumably been taken in by its own press releases. Gen. Arthur MacArthur 8, Otis's subordinate (and later replacement), commented, "... I believed that Aguinaldo's troops represented only a faction. I did not like to believe that the whole population of Luzon-the native population, that is-was opposed to us..."9 But this he was "reluctantly compelled" to believe because the "unique system of warfare" employed by the Filipino Army" ... depended upon almost complete unity of action of the entire native population." 10 </TEXT>

In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers).


Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan.


The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to "achieve US policy" but the Muslim MILF/Huks never were. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved.
Similarly the US resorted to what are now called "War Crimes, "Crimes Against Humanity" and "Genocide" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented "concentration camps" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok ("mountain(s)" in Tagalog - source of our word "boondocks") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as "protective hamlets" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was "every able-bodied man" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone.


The Fil-Am war started when the Americans had promised, in writing, to free Filipinos from the Spanish to form a new Philippine nation under Filipino rule, and then reneged on the promise.
The phrase "our little brown bothers" comes from this era as the excuse to break the agreement. The attitudes are summed up in political cartoons of the time: 1[1]  , 2[2]   and 3[3]  . This really no different from attitudes prevalent today about arabs and muslims. We simply call the all "terrorists" as a direct substitute for "nxxxxx" as used in 1899. Nothing has changed.

<TEXT> Lets assume you are right, someone just lied about thermite in that peer reviewed study, this still does not detract from the point that all the evidence suggests that some form on thermitic material was used and thus the official government conspiracy theory is a complete made up fantasy story

____

NIST claims that WTC 1 amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called irrelevant, given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.

-----------

**Physical Evidence**

-----

* [Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMAs 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study](http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf)
* [Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled The Deep Mystery of Melted Steel, which said:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)

 gt; Steel  which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit  may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon  called a eutectic reaction  occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.

* [Stating that the New York Times called these findings perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation, the article added:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)

 gt;A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges  which are curled like a paper scroll  have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes  some larger than a silver dollar  let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending  but not holes.

* [In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled WTC Dust Signature, at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove \(to its insurance company\) that the building was pervasively contaminated with WTC Dust](http://web.archive.org/web/20131204202627/http://www.ae911truth.org/documents/WTCDustSignature_ExpertReport.051304.1646.mp_.pdf) The report listed five elements in this signature, one of which was: Spherical iron and spherical or vesicular silicate particles that result from exposure to high temperature

* [In 2005, the United States Geological Survey \(USGS\) published a report entitled Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust, which was intended to aid the identification of WTC dust components. Among the components, it reported, were metal or metal oxides (which could not be distinguished by the USGSs methods). The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust, the report said, are Fe-rich \[iron-rich\] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles](http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html)
* [Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction](http://journalof911studies.com/articles/WTCHighTemp2.pdf) 
* [Journal of the American Society of Safety Engineers](http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/wtc/analysis/asse_groundzero1.htm)
 gt;The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400F to more than 2,800F
* [Sources related to exceptionally high temperatures, and/or to persistent heat at Ground Zero](http://911research.wtc7.net/papers/dreger/GroundZeroHeat2008_07_10.pdf) 
* FEMA documents in their [Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team study](http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1512-20490-8452/403_apc.pdf), for sample 1, evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting. A sulfur-rich liquid containing primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur penetrated into the steel.

**Testimonial Evidence**

-----

**Testimony from Firefighters:**

* [New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: Youd get down below and youd see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like youre in a foundry, like lava.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY)
* [Joe OToole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, was dripping from the molten steel.](http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero amp;p=2948)
* [New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM)

-----

**Testimony from Other Professionals:**

-----

* [Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, I think youd be interested in this, and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto amp;t=40s)
* [Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helens and the thousands who fled that disaster.](http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf)
* [In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.](http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm)
* [Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: Its just too hot for rescuers to get into \[some\] areas. So we do not know yet whats in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.](http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812)
* Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.
* [Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.](http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160 amp;FMT=ABS amp;FMTS=FT amp;date=Nov+1,+2001 amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS)
* [OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions](http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo)   

 gt; Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. **OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.**

-----

**Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:**

-----

* [Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.](http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx)
* [Sarah Atlas, of New Jerseys Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html)
* Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed everything from molten steel beams to human remains

--------

The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.

When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible </TEXT>

It is not a theory that thermite might have been involved, there is peer reviewed documentation that nano-thermite most defiantly was involved

<TEXT> There is a large body of evidence indicating that cross-country differences in income levels are
associated with differences in productivity. If workers are much more productive in one country
than in another, restrictions on immigration lead to large efficiency losses. The paper quantifies
these losses, using a model in which efficiency differences are labor-augmenting, and free trade
in product markets leads to factor price equalization, so that wages are equal across countries
when measured in efficiency units of labor. The estimated gains from removing immigration
restrictions are huge. Using a simple static model of migration costs, the estimated net gains
from open borders are about the same as the gains from a growth miracle that more than doubles
the income level in less-developed countries.
