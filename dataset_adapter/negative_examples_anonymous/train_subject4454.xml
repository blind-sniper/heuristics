<TEXT> Coulter lists all the reasons why she says soccer is not a real sport. Among them: "Individual achievement is not a big factor."

"The blame is dispersed and almost no one scores anyway," Coulter writes. "There are no heroes, no losers, no accountability, and no child's fragile self-esteem is bruised. There's a reason perpetually alarmed women are called 'soccer moms,' not 'football moms.'"

Another: It's boring, she claims.

"If Michael Jackson had treated his chronic insomnia with a tape of Argentina vs. Brazil instead of Propofol, he'd still be alive, although bored," Coulter quips.

It's not violent enough for Coulter.

"The prospect of either personal humiliation or major injury is required to count as a sport," she writes. "Most sports are sublimated warfare."

In American football, she writes, "ambulances carry off the wounded. After a soccer game, every player gets a ribbon and a juice box."

And despite the stellar ratings that Sunday's USA-Portugal game received in the United States (18.2 million viewers, according to ESPN), Coulter doesn't believe the sport is actually catching on here.

"The same people trying to push soccer on Americans are the ones demanding that we love HBO's 'Girls,' light-rail, Beyonc and Hillary Clinton," she writes. "The number of New York Times articles claiming soccer is 'catching on' is exceeded only by the ones pretending women's basketball is fascinating."

Coulter claims she's not the only one bored by soccer in the States. "One group of sports fans with whom soccer is not 'catching on' at all, is African-Americans," Coulter writes. "They remain distinctly unimpressed by the fact that the French like it.

"If more 'Americans' are watching soccer today, it's only because of the demographic switch effected by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 immigration law," Coulter adds. "I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time."

<TEXT> Ok, the gun by itself is not banned or illegal just the act of the transaction between the father and son because of his previous felony charge. 

It still would not matter because not only was the straw purchase done (illegal). Stealing the gun from the mother (illegal). Walking inside a Church in SC with a gun (illegal). No law or policy would have prevented the shooter to commit the act. In order for laws to work, criminals must follow them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  After all, if they don't cover something when you're asleep, then how could their coverage be "24-7 since early in the morning yesterday"?

Replay. Happens all the time.

 If they can provide coverage for hours as soon as the event begins for a missing plane

The news broke during the day and so its easier and you have more time to tell people to stay in longer, make calls, cancel programming, and organize the rest of the news programming later in the day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What needs to happen? The guys is caught in less than 24 hours because of media attention and the community/people coming together. There's no reasonable policy that will protect against a future evil act other than arming pastors and having security guards at churches. The administration proposed semi-automatic rifle gun bans in the wake of Sandy Hook in order to prevent another Adam Lanza. This dude legally used a regular old pistol to conduct his shooting spree so it wouldn't have mattered at all. There are just things in this world that you cannot control, and that is preventing sick, evil people to plan out their sick, evil fantasies. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  if a foreign terrorist had committed this attack we would be doing a heck of a lot more then skirting the issue. 

There is no issue here that can be controlled, and to use this as a political statement so soon to score political points is pretty sick.


 Larry Wilmore who comes on after Stewart had a good point that if things didn't change after sandy hook then things will never change. I gotta agree sadly.

If things didn't change after Ferguson riots, then things will never change. I gotta agree sadly. </TEXT>
