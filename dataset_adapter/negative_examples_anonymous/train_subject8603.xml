<TEXT> Never had an issue in over a year. If it ever went down, it was due to Comcast sucking. Whose your internet provider in your area? Do other streaming services on other devices have similar issues? 

I'm not gonna discount your issue, sounds frustrating as hell, but I've recommended Chromecast to dozens of friends and have only heard back praise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Paper mache'd over a beach ball, then added the shapes with pool noodle foam and paper mache'd over that. For the eyes I got a couple of electric tealights from Dollar Tree and 2 halves of a ping pong ball. And instead of using a helmet or hardhat inside, I used the rest of the pool noodle to create a sort of head harness, which makes it super lightweight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in Tallahassee for 4 years (2009-2013) and have lived in Jacksonville before that and currently live in Riverside (4 months), so I think I may be of some help. If you're looking for nice walkable areas to enjoy outdoorsy stuff, both cities have their charms. Jacksonville has the beaches and the restaurants and bars in and around downtown/Riverside are great and improving at a very high rate. Tallahassee's downtown/Gaines street/midtown areas are also seeing a lot of improvement at a similar pace.

I feel that Jacksonville's Riverside is definitely more conducive for family activities with things for children and adults to enjoy, while in Tallahassee it is much more catered to those in their 20s. There may be some areas scattered around Tallahassee but not at the density I think you're looking for.

If you're interested in music and culture, both Jacksonville's Art Walk and Tallahassee's Railroad Square First Friday are both very similar events, but I really enjoy the intimacy of Railroad Square compared to the downtown event in Jacksonville. 

Its definitely a tough choice as both cities are seeing massive improvements and have their drawback in terms of size/neighborhood selection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Weirdly tangential story. I was friends with the animator for Waterman early on in the series run. We had both gone to school overseas since we were both Navy kids. My friend went off too college back in the states and I was a senior in high school a few months from leaving myself. One day I get an AIM message from Bryan Waterman, who I was a big fan of at the time along with other flash shows like Tomorrow's Nobodies, asking me to go to my friend's house to retrieve flash files for the DVD release of those episodes and some files that were going to be used on a movie he was working on. I didn't have a car at the time so I had to bike a couple miles to my friends place, then walk back with entire desktop PC precariously balanced on my bike because my friend's house didn't have Internet at the time and I had to email them to Waterman. This was back in 2005, so quite some time ago. What a weird saga that turned out to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> About a mile/20 minute walk from the hotel, but midtown is packed with bars. You have Waterworks, Spaceport, Wine Loft, Mockingbird, Leon Pub, Midtown Filling Station, and Finnegan's Wake, all within a tiny radius of each other. 
There is also a neat speakeasy in the area. You'll probably want to call ahead with a reservation and the drinks are pretty pricy, but its a cool experience. http://www.alchemymidtown.com/ Also Level 8 in Hotel Duval, and Midtown Station a little up Monroe are also there. But if you have the time, definitely take check out Fermentation Lounge. It's a really nice place to have a drink with some friends and make new ones. I now realize I look like a drunk. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Military Power of Attorney over a car loan. (Florida) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-09 23:07:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'd recently had my car totaled and found a new car to replace it, and financing it through USAA. After dealing with a few snags, it finally came time to do a title transfer from the dealer to myself, but with my mother as the cosigner on the car. The Leon County tax collectors required an original signature, but seeing as my family lives on a Navy Base in Italy, that process would take a couple of weeks to resolve. My parents are getting a power of attorney for me to complete any transactions requiring her signature be on the actual title, but seeing as how even priority mail might not get here for at least a week, would a photocopy of the POA provided by Naval Legal suffice for a title transfer into my name?

**TLDR: Is a photocopy of a military power of attorney viable in Florida until the actual document arrives about a week later?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Tallahassee, FL. While I understand that legally I am obliged by the lease, receiving a note saying that I have an extra 3 days to pay rent is huge, especially for a poor college student. The current managers claim to have been there since the beginning of June, and they didn't seem to have a problem with payment on the 5th last month. Now I'm just thinking it was some sort of ploy from the previous owners now just to throw in one last monkey wrench into a sinking ship. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> New apartment managers are trying to screw me by saying I owe a late fee, even though the month prior we had received a note saying that the rent due date had been changed to the 5th, with even the receptionist confirming that was the case. Paid rent on the 5th of June without issue. This month, go in to the office to pay rent on the 5th only to be informed that we owed a late fee because our rent was due on the 2nd, as per the original lease contract that was signed with the 3rd or 4th previous apartment management company. Management seems to change every couple months, so its incredibly confusing. I no longer have the original note stating the change of due date, but I'm hoping one of our neighbors still does. Any advice? </TEXT>

I start off by boiling about 1/2 a cup of water, adding only about 3 tbsp of natural peanut butter and adding garlic powder, sesame oil, soy sauce, and Sriracha, and when I'm feeling a little cheery, a bit of vodka.

<TEXT> My local grocery store's cheapest can of tahini is exorbitantly expensive at about $15 (even with a pretty good Arabic population) and might not be as easily found in some places. I also went through the supply I did buy rather quickly. It could be found online for pretty cheap, so I might just do that in the future and revise this recipe, but for now, this is a quick and dirty way to get hummus without having to pay too much for it at the grocery store. Its also far and away a better alternative then most recipes I see that don't use tahini. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a pretty good approximation, especially if you use something similar to Naturally More peanut butter where you have to mix in the oils before you eat it. Something premixed like Jif or Peter Pan is going to have a lot more sugar and probably make your hummus sweeter, but not so much that its inedible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is really annoying. The left speaker went out the day after I bought it but I just dealt with it since the right speaker was plenty loud enough for what I needed it for. Now my right speaker is out for some inexplicable reason. It had been working earlier in the day, but when I got home from work, the speaker had just stopped putting out sound. The sound works fine if I plug in headphones, but is a pain. Has anyone else had this problem and maybe fixed it themselves, or am I going to have to get in touch with HP Support in the hopes that they can either fix it or send me a replacement.  </TEXT>
