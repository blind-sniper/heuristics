<TEXT> I've heard it's a bad sign when a dog starts doing that "I'll bite you but I'm not really biting you" thing. It's them testing to see if they can put part of Little Billy in their mouths and get away with it.

Convoluted but - I knew a guy who's Nan had a friend that had a big dog and it started doing this to the new baby. Not really a bite, just putting its mouth around the baby's hands and feet. They walked in the room once and the dog had the baby's arm in its mouth, somehow they thought nothing of it. Next day, the dog mauled the poor bab's face off.   

Edit: punctuation </TEXT>

<TEXT> 91 minutes and 37 seconds is in the 92nd minute of the game. The first minute of the game is from 0-1minute.

Kind of how the years 1900-1999 are the 20th century. I hope that makes any sense.

<TEXT> A guy I know makes a similar product and is set to hit $20 million this year. He created a marketable brand, then he hired a hot girl to follow other hot girls on Instagram and offer free samples. Rinse and repeat. 

It's a numbers game and I'm making it sound easy but social media is a really useful tool for marketing beauty products, especially if the customer uses the body scrub as part of their daily routine. </TEXT>

Ahh, I thought I recognised the name. It's interesting what you say about them helping to drag you out of a sad mood, they do the same for me, I guess it's a comfort thing.

I'll check out the animated stuff, watched some of it when it first came out. Have you listened to the bonus hour podcast they did, it's my go to! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALGFVxKv2f4

<TEXT> I know it's a joke, but it seems that a large portion of users here resort to penis/ejaculation references to describe their appreciation of something. 

Look at a thread of a good goal or bit of skill, and at least one of the top comments will be "I came" or "My erection just exploded hrnggggg".

That's my observation, I'm not saying this is good or bad. 

Edit: maybe 'large portion' is a bit much, but these penis comments do get upvoted </TEXT>

<TEXT> Song Cry is a masterpiece. The emotion Hov generates make this one of those songs you listen to on a rainy walk through the city thinking about old friends and girls gone past.  

-  "We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather, now we fly first class to change the forecast."

- "We was on the block since free lunch, we shoulda been together eatin' Four Seasons brunch"

- "They say you can't turn a bad girl good, but once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever, I mourn forever, shit I've gotta live the fact I did you wrong forever."

U Don't Know is a masterpiece. His braggadocious lyrics walk us through his gang-banging beginnings and his rise to the top. I get so pumped listening to this track, makes me want to put on a tux and sell crack in a police station.

- "One million, two million, three million, four, five years later, forty million more." 

- "Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I triple my worth"

- "I'm rapin' Def Jam till I'm the hundred million man."

- "I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell, I am a hustler baby, I sell water to a well."

Heart Of The City is a night-time driving song, a street-beating, atmosphere -soaking, big-pimping classic. The instrumental on its own is a classic. 

- "Young fucks spitting at me, young rappers getting at me, my nigga Big predicted the shit exactly, mo money, mo problems gotta move carefully, cos faggots hate when you getting money like athletes."

- "But the only thing running is numbers fam, Jigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love?"

- "Ain't no love in the heart of the city, ain't no love in the heart of town"

Shit this album is straight bangers all the way through and Hov's lyrics and flow really take you on a journey. It gets me so excited for... I don't know. The future? The past? You'll be rapping to this for months afterwards without even realising. The Blueprint is what made me fall in love with Jay-Z.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not quite the same but recently I met some guys from
England and there were lots of foreign people there too. They would occassionally slip into a high-pitched Geordie (Newcastle, England) accent so they couldn't be understood by non-native English speakers. 

There was an American girl there who said she couldn't understand them when they spoke like that. One of the guys turned to the other and said in high-pitched Geordie, "She's got a right set of bangers on her!". 

She totally understood that time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This song was the hold music when I was on the phone yesterday. Sang by a female, it had a 90's feel to it, like TLC or something. It sounded like a black girl, all up and down. 

Google doesn't return anything with those lyrics apart from Macy Gray and some rap songs. It's driving me crazy.

<TEXT> TL;DR: Friend had mole, Peeps would troll, Threats on the doc, Surgery, Mole stop. 

My friend had a mole on his face that he wanted removing. After 'Austin Powers: Goldmember' came out in 2002, people everywhere would point at his mole and say "...Moley, moley, mole." Strangers on the train, people outside the clubs, a taxi driver, his school friends. He used to get in fights about it on a Saturday. Some fella in the kebab shop, havin' it large with the lads. Gets a bit cocky waiting for his chips. Jumps up from his chair and spins to look at his crew. They all look up at him and he starts to point across the room at the mole, dancing a little jig towards my friend with his finger outstretched. More people start to look. Conversations stop. Silence in the kebab shop. One of the kebab dudes actually turned off the spinning meat cooker. Everyones looking at the pointing guy then he announces, "Minstrel." The roof blows off the kebab shop (yet to be found) and my friend has an unwanted nickname for the rest of his life. He said his mole wasn't as big as a Minstrel. 

He got sick of the harassment so went to the doctor to get it removed. They said it wasn't dangerous, "we'll put you on the list." He asked them how long the list is. They said it was two years. He left the Doctor's surgery, mole intact, and tried to ignore the receptionist, who had taken the time to find the 'Goldmember' mole clip on YouTube and was now showing it to that dentist from the adjacent building.

He decided enough was enough and marched back into the doctor's office and explained that the mole was giving him hell and if they didn't operate immediately, he was going to whip it off himself. He maintains he would've. The doctor fast-tracked him to a senior surgeon and they had it off within the hour.

Now he's just a bloke with a scar on his face.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's good. I'm a huge fan of Drake's love songs and his RnB edge, so I loved the emotional ride he took us on through Take Care. NWTS has some strong melodies and his rapping is solid. 

I'm glad that there was no Lil Wayne appearance, I'm sick of hearing him every time I listen to Drake.

I just hoped there would be more soulful singing, but I guess this is just the refinement of his sound.

On my bedside table was a mug and a glass. As I was deciding which one to use as my DIY speaker, I said to myself specifically, 'the glass will be better to use.' Picked it up. 

Turned around and checked if my laundry was dry. When I looked down, I was holding the mug. 

Shouted, "No. Fucking. Way". The glass was still on my bedside table.  </TEXT>

What I mean is, what was there before? If there was nothing, then how did it become something? Where did all these atoms come from? Where is the beginning of the story?

<TEXT> I tend not to complain, purely because I know what it's like to have someone complaint to you, and it can be uncomfortable. 

However, in a restaurant once, my garlic bread was soggy, so I asked for it to be replaced in the nicest way possible. They obliged and I got an extra portion for free. 

I'm more likely to 'politely question' the service I'm receiving, as people are much responsive to soft probing, as opposed to ranting and demanding. If you are kind and explain your point reasonably, most service staff will find it hard to turn down your requests, whether your complaining about the state of your hotel room, or you want your soggy garlic bread replaced. 

TL;DR: Politely question the service you receive instead of complaining. You'll easily get what you want.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm travelling around the world come January and I want to teach English as a foreign language. I hear that teaching in China is well-paid and sometimes they even pay your accommodation. Do some research into teaching English in Asia, there's TONNES of info. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> People that don't understand the difference between respecting somebody's opinion and respecting someone's RIGHT to hold that opinion. 

I respect that people have the right to say what they want, when they want and to who they want. Doesn't mean I have to respect what they say.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely agree. So stress-free; you know where you are going to be at what time, your whole day is planned for you, you know who you're going to see. 

But life is huge! The world is full of wonders. Do what you love, no matter what anyone else thinks or says. Stay chill, stay true to yourself, be kind and be the person YOU want to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only used it once out of interest. 

Found a contract killer's site. He charged $10,000 (or the BitCoin equivalent) per assassination; $30,000 if it was a political figure. 

There are also marketplaces for every drug under the sun, guns, stolen goods and even counterfeit money. I found one site where you asked for an item and the guy would go and steal it for you. 

LOT'S of child pornography as well, which is why I don't want to use it again. I didn't actually see any myself, as most of those sites/image boards are flagged, so you can avoid it if you want to. 

I did hear that there's also a lot of very useful and helpful stuff on there, but I didn't stumble across any of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shit! I'm actually doing this in January!

Me and my best fucking bro in the world had been talking about travelling the world for ages. About 2 months ago I handed my notice in at work and bought a one-way ticket to Australia. 

We're going to live there for a year with a working holiday visa and then just go with the flow. 

I'm in the process of selling all of my possessions. It makes you realise how much shit you have. One of my friends described it as, 'shedding my skin.'

Take the plunge and shed your skin. You said it yourself, nothing is holding you back! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speeding is my biggest peeve; as a driver, a cyclist and a pedestrian. 

One time, in a 30mph zone with a speed camera, some guy is driving up my back while I stick to the speed limit. Out of nowhere, he drives up on to the pavement (sidewalk) and overtakes me, eventually dropping back down onto the road, screeching to a halt in the middle of the lane and blocking my way. He gets out his car and storms over to my window, telling me that the reason I've been driving so slowly (AKA: The Speed Limit) is because I've obviously been drinking! (I hadn't). He speeds off and gets flashed by the speed camera. I followed him all the way down the road tooting my horn and flashing my lights; he was livid. 

The town where I grew up was full of boy racers. If you haven come a cross this term, it's the name we in the UK give to youths with shitty cars that they mod with huge spoilers and dampers, then drive around the town all night at ludicrous speeds. Round and round they go for hours in convoy, music blaring, engines 'roaring'. About 6 of them have died in crashes in the past few years. Their own fault every time. 

I hate speeding, it's so irresponsible.  </TEXT>
