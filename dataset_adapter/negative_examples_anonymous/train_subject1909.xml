<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, we know it took at least PART of Rose to make Steven, and Lion has so many links with Rose... isn't it safe to say that the parts of Rose that weren't needed to make Steven, made Lion. I mean... HE'S FUCKING PINK! He had Rose's sword in him, and her battle flag. Rose told Pearl all her secrets, so if Lion was around before Rose died, Pearl would have known. There are also some BIG holes in this theory, like, wasn't someone there when Steven was born? Wouldn't they see Lion being born, and why would Lion be in the desert and not with the gems like Steven was his whole life? If I think of some more I will post in comments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have never played a Final Fantasy game. I have always been a fan of RPGs and would like to try/play a JRPG but, unfortunately don't have money. Final Fantasy 7 if viewed by many as the greatest game ever made, and considered by many more the greatest RPG ever made. I do not have a PS4 so I will be unable to get the remake anyways, and would love to experience the original, even if it hasn't aged to well graphics wise. Many people complain that I haven't played the greatest RPG and I would love to join the circle jerk but I don't have the money.

<TEXT> I really want to go on a salt filled rant about all these fatpeoplehate idiots that would get on bestof and I would have gold for 10 years. Instead, I only have 2 words. *Fuck you.* I have been a fan of Boogie for years now and it sucks how these assholes have no respect for him and what he has been through because he weighs "too much". I have been following boogie for a while and it astounds me how he gets all this hate and keeps going, keeps trying, and continues to inspire people. This dude is amazing. His fan base is just as great. He has the best community, who fucks up every asshole in the comments section who is a dick. Every time Boogie makes a video, I click it, and watch it. I will laugh, or cry. This dude has brought so much joy, and courage into my life there is nothing I can say to these pea brained bigots who don't look at *him*, but his *weight*. Also, I realize this is exactly what I said I wouldn't do earlier on in this comment... fuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I may be saying this because I am a salty April 1st 60s, but the tables are starting to turn. There are now more reds than purples. This means being purple is more rare than being red. Eventually people will want to get as early as possible. Because of this, the timer will go down, and it will end. Just an idea. Also, if there are more reds than purples, why are there more *active* purples? The statistics are mind numbing for someone unfamiliar with this type of stuff.  </TEXT>

There are billions of billions of nuclei in the body, including Cell's. Also, according to this, "Cell Juniors (Jr.) are the seven offspring of Cell. They are asexually produced from Cell's tail, through cellular mitosis.[2] According to Cell himself, each Cell Junior has his power and abilities."

<TEXT> This may seem like advertisement, but I assure you it isn't. It is raising awareness to a charity. If there are other places I could post this where it would be more relevant I would gladly do so, or you could. There is a charity going to get children in Detroit Hospital a "GO kart" which is a kiosk with a tv and everything hooked up so a child who can't leave their room, can still enjoy games. Currently Twitch streamer DanGheesling is doing this charity event to provide these. He has 4 hours left and is half way there. We, the PC gamers, could easily help him, even if we each gave 50 cents. (USD) This is a great charity I think we could support. Now there is one problem, they are xbones, but do you think a kid, who hasn't his bed in a month would give a fuck? If you are donating or even watching, cut the master race shit and support a good cause.

Is there any alternative to that sword that I could use in Anor Londo or if any of you have a Quelaag sword or souls that doesn't fit your build could I have it? Keep in mind I am a noob.

If you don't have the game yet, great, if you do, you need some extra money. Anyway here's the point. At Walmart, because they don't know how games work, you can still get the Day 1 edition! The code works too! It is valid until 2099, so you'll be fine.

EDIT: Sorry! Only console!! :(

<TEXT> It was a Cloverfield done right in my opinion. It has the scares, suspense, everything you need. It is inspired slightly bi Slenderman but really added most of the iconic Slender things like the noise when he's around, the static, many other things I won't spoil. Its great but expect the spoops. :D </TEXT>

as a mouse pad because it is from one of my favorite movies. (The Final Sacrifice) If the resolution is not right, I would not care if the image was stretched or had black bars. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I REALLY need parts. Unfortunately they cost lots of money which I don't have. I have only upgraded my PC once. At the moment I have a Core 2 Duo, 1TB HDD (The only good bit) 4GB of memory, whatever the heck intel mobo that the pc came with, and Intel G41 Express Chipset. It can't run anything at more than 30 FPS. I never have had a good PC but I don't use consoles solely because I lack the money to buy the console or games, and they're awful. I have started a fund so any money I don't need goes in. Currently it is $25. I would cry tears of joy if I could win this card to help me ascend a little higher up. Thank You for reading OP. If you want to steam message me just PM me and I will tell you details. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I'm making a build. I have no money. There is no way on earth I can afford to buy it all at once. My PC ATM is really awful.
(Intel Core 2 Duo E7400 @ 2.80GHz, Intel G41 Express Chipset, 4.00GB Dual-Channel DDR2, Intel Corporation DG41RQ) and I am going to make an upgrade... eventually. I am going to buy the parts one by one and slowly replace my pc. (Like that boat paradox, if you know what I'm talking about) I want to buy parts that can replace my parts now until I have replaced every part. Can you guys help me pick really cheap parts that are usable and that could fit in my pc now? 

Sincerely, someone whos pc is still better than a console but still is shit, Michael... </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite doctor is the newest, Peter Capaldi. He just came on the scene and I am already in love with him. His character is more dark and powerful than the other doctors, so you never know what he is going to do. Claras character perfectly compliments his, always keeping him in check and often taking matters into her own hands. The writing this season has been a little chiche but is still great. Capaldi is making Doctor Who better no matter what the 9 year old girls say who hate him because he is old. </TEXT>

You are an amazing actress and wondered if you were asked to do a voicing role for a video game or a cartoon/English anime dub if you would do it. I don't know if it would be your decision or not because I know hardly anything about the acting industry. Also, who was your favorite actor/actress to work with? (P.S.
