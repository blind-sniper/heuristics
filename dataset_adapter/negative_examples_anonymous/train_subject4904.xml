<TEXT> Hi scrubs.

Since you guys decided to riun the 2x XP for me and my wife, we each took a different region and spectated.   We frapped across several games, complied the footage and uploaded as private videos to youtube.    We then gave hirez access.  Personally we identified over 60 players using it across 1 or more games.  I sincerely hope I was responsible for your ban.
