[Here's one for $220](http://www.grouseriver.com/Soviet-SKS-Semi-Auto-7-62x39-Rifle) and [another for $200 on a seller I've heard mentioned highly.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=85526)

More products to make an American like me jealous?

[How about a Chinese M14? Half its US price.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=85814)

[Chinese Army handguns? Got 'em!](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/category.jsp?catid=85812)

[Genuine USSR Tokarevs for $200! Compared to $3-400 US on the off chance you can even find one!](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=81898)

[A Browning M2, if you've got $5000 and a Prohibited license for some reason.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=75108)

But then, the RCMP makes me almost thankful to have the ATF and your licensing system is a bit restrictive for my tastes, so I guess it evens out. Point is, if you want guns in Canada, there are options. Oh, and if you're after AKs, I hear unrestricted CZ-58s are due back in production. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a Marui FAMAS and some AEGs by Echo(?) for a while. Also, gun ownership in Canada isn't *too* bad. I mean, y'all get dirt cheap SVTs and SKSs, so it's not all awful. I mean, the RCMP keeps some really awful gun laws in effect from what I hear, but there are a number of things up there to be envious of. You can still get stuff from Norinco, for example. We can't. I am keenly envious of that one. Still, if you ever find yourself in the states and want to shoot an AK, tons of folks over on /r/ak47 and /r/firearms have them and I'm sure would let you shoot. I myself own one, but I'm quite a ways away from the Canadian border. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chinese AKs are actually pretty highly regarded. I'd rate them in the same tier as Soviet AKs, personally. At least the AKs from the Polytech and Norinco factories.  Anyway, judging from [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/bcU8AkL.jpg), it looks like their full sized AKs at least use compatible furniture and the bottom handguard retainer even looks to be close to spec. If I were still into airsoft, I'd likely pick one of these up. I don't think they were around when I played. If they were, I hadn't heard of them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree here. For full disclosure, my girlfriend works and has worked in pharmaceutical development and while a LOT of it is down to skeezy business practices and lobbying, developing medicine is a risky and expensive process. I, for one, would much rather have it be a nationalized process and remove it from the shady morality inherent to anything that's done under profit motives, but as long as medicine is a capitalist enterprise it's going to be at least a little expensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's my feeling. I, too, am a white male from the South; albeit not especially conservative. To me the flag represents the army that many of my ancestors served and a lot of positive aspects of Southern culture - the Dukes of Hazzard and Lynyrd Skynyrd, for example. That said, it was used by an army that propped up a racist regime and therefore has no place in any setting funded by tax dollars or wherein the functions of government might occur. I can completely understand how it makes black people uncomfortable. What the South needs is a new flag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Russian army

I'm actually somewhat well versed in the Donbass conflict as I've done some research and discussion with people over there. Everybody I've talked to on the DPR and LPR side seems to be a local who really, genuinely dislikes the Ukraine and is quite displeased with the Maidan, so to call it a Russian invasion is incredibly disingenuous. 

But that's another discussion entirely.

As for the crimes of the Soviets, none of this is news to me. But that's how all hegemonies act. If the Soviets were an empire, they'd have been far worse. What do you think happens in any country where the US sets up a dictator? Look at how we ran South Vietnam and Argentina. Still, nobody calls the United States an empire, at least nobody of any sort of geopolitical credibility. The only states I can think of in the 21st or 20th centuries who might truly be called Empires in the truest sense of the word are Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and the nascent ISIS state. 

I do hope you don't mind me asking, but just for context, what country do you live in? I know that some countries: Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania - got it worse than others under the Soviets.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They built hospitals, infrastructure, schools, and housing. They increased standards of education and industry in most of the places they went while also fighting backwards social trends and inequality. A lot of places in the former Soviet sphere are still using Soviet infrastructure because the capitalist governments that came in afterwards are too corrupt to spend any money on fixing and replacing it.

The Soviets weren't universally evil in every single regard. There were many, many problems with the Soviet system, but to forget the good that they did is to forget a huge part of the past, and we do the past a tremendous disservice in trying to turn it into a good vs evil melodrama. 

Rather, what we should do is take the good that they did and the good that America does, learn from the mistakes of both systems, and try to use these lessons in forging ahead to a better tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to UNIT special archives released to WikiLeaks, the entity known as "The Doctor" has been seen several times in connection to Cyberdyne research projects and Skynet in particular. If the conjecture that Skynet is supposed to be of great importance to the course of human history holds true and the conspiracy theories regarding time traveling battle robots holds any water, it would make sense that the Doctor would have an interest in this. 

Moreover, the Dyson family in particular have been rumored to owe the survival of their son Danny to the Doctor after the shootout that claimed the life of Miles Dyson. It's not unlikely that Danny would design the avatar of his father's life's work to resemble the man who saved his own life. 

Of course, all of this is just conjecture. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Wanted: Writers, Audio Assistants, and Voice Actors for a BioShock radio play </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-30 07:16:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Cue announcement music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogDy2Yk1W9A)

I'm an aspiring voice actor and have often honed my somewhat meager talents by producing audio projects. As a huge BioShock fan, a tale set in the BioShock universe seemed a natural for me and I began to embark on it with my utmost attention. 

At a certain point, I decided that this could be so much more than a half-assed amusement. Drawing upon /u/Zombietimm's post in a writing prompt [I submitted on this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/34y1do/writing_prompt_the_year_is_2015_the_place_is/?utm_source=feedburner utm_medium=email utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reddit%2FeCVh+%28Bioshock%29), I've devised a short list of characters and a rough timeline for what Rapture might be like in the year 2015. I have a story forming in my head, but I feel that this will need more than my talents to become a reality. And so I turn to you, /r/BioShock.

Basically, I need a writer to help me with characterization. It's always been a weakness of mine, as dialogue and character volition tend to lack in my writing. I'm more about world building and technical details. I also need someone to help me find foley and record from multiple people's computers. Finally, in the longshot event that this actually produces a script, I will eventually need voice actors. The characters I have so far, just to whet your appetites for events to come, are as follows: 

Captain Benjamin O'Hurley: an ageing career officer of the United States Navy. He's slightly too old to have been chasing Soviet subs for most of his career and never captained a mission during the Cold War. He is thus inexperienced with large scale threats, despite his many years of service. Prefers observation and 

Lieutenant Commander Miles Jenkins: The Texas' Executive Officer. A recent appointment to Captain O'Hurley's crew, this recent graduate of the Newport Officer's School was quickly promoted through to his current rank by unknown means. He directly commands the Texas' SEAL detachment and closely guards his Pentagon orders.

Orville Dodgson: A twisted, elderly man, first encountered in the ruins of Rapture. This barely coherent old man, twisted both in mind and body by severe deformities, raves endlessly about the works of Lewis Carroll. How he has survived so long in so inhospitable a place is uncertain. What is known, however, is that he will prove indispensable in deciphering the mysteries of this place. 

The Red Queen: the principal antagonist, the Red Queen seems to be the only force holding Rapture's remaining inhabitants together. She maintains the lumbering behemoths who fight a Sisyphean battle against the encroaching oceans with her mad court of semi-coherent, wizard-like scientists and supplies the twisted Splicers with the ADAM their bodies crave. Rumor has it that this so-called True Utopian had ventured to the surface and returned to save her people. 

Additionally, I will need various sailors, soldiers, splicers, and survivors; with multiple voice actors playing multiple roles.

Coordination will take place over Skype or Google Hangouts, with consensus ruling on the decision.

As this is a noncommercial fan project, I won't be able to pay anyone and can understand if people can't give 100% of their time to this, but I'd really like to see it happen and I just know that if anybody can do it, BioShock fans can. 

**Wow! This has gotten a lot of attention!** I am honored to have received so much interest from everyone. Thank you all so much! With any luck, we'll return in a month or two to show off our masterpiece. Bunny masks will be mandatory for the unveiling. 

**Update 2** I am thankful beyond words to all of the people volunteering to make this project a reality. I'm finding that I really need people with knowledge of US Navy equipment and SOP, as well as people who are familiar with *Something in the Sea* to consult on various world and character details. If this is you, please consult with us!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The three stars represent the past, which we must ever be mindful of; the present, whose importance needs no mentioning; and the future with all the promise it holds.

The 13 stripes represent the 13 states usually associated with the South.

The triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts, symbolizing the desire most Southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love. This point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I had never stated that the factory committees needed to go away, as consensus is more often than not the best decision maker. Unfortunately, consensus can be difficult to build in conflict or crisis situations. I suppose that functional titles are fine in placid or sedentary organizations where change is slow in coming, but rapid and dynamic fields demand hierarchy. Hospitals and armies, for example, need ranks and authority. Factories, supermarkets (which should ideally be replaced by growers and farmers markets), and many technical fields can function quite well under the initial Soviet model. 

But yeah, fuck Stalin and his revisionist, reactionary ways. We agree there, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, this was tried by the Voyenrevcom after the Russian revolution. Ranks, much like every other form of organizational hierarchy, were seen as bourgeois and oppressive and were thus done away with, replaced by functional titles. This worked quite poorly for the Red Army and served as an abject lesson. Unfortunately, hierarchy of some sort or another will always be needed, be it in offices or factories or the battlefield. The challenge is to ensure that everybody is compensated fairly and has equal opportunity to advance within this structure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what I came to say. Realize that to make something nuke proof will require a degree of flexibility in order for the structure to better absorb seismic shockwaves from ground detonations (which are actually quite rare in nuclear doctrine, as most nuclear exchange scenarios call for extensive use of airburst detonations, maximizing damage over a larger area. The extensive radiological contamination and presence of obscene amounts of, erm, fallout leads me to believe that the Chinese of the Fallout universe favored ground detonations.).

Anyway, in order to counter the almost earthquake like forces at play in ground detonations, many real world underground shelters, like nuclear silo control rooms, were built with hinges and joists pretty much everywhere. Realize that by the outset of Fallout 3, Vault 101 was over 200 years old. These joists and joints and hinges would have corroded and decayed. Honestly, I'd have expected the whole place to fall apart much sooner. We can engineer structures to survive a nuclear war, but humanity will never outlast the sands of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To say that what capitalism is is inherent on the states it's produced is as flawed as Calling soviet Russia an authentic communist state

Hm. Those are terms that I'd understand. Got a source on that book? Is it in wiki commons or anything? I lean Marxist, if only because I'm fairly convinced that mankind can never possibly build Communism, but am always open to exposing myself to other points of view.

I do suppose, however, that my biggest problem with capitalism lies in its inherent ability to exploit and corrupt - much the same problem present in most strains of Socialist theory, mind you. Any time the exceptional are allowed to rise, they will generally abuse said power and exploit the proletariat. Advancement, it has been proven, rewards low level sociopathic traits to a degree. Further, the disabled and the elderly seem to have very little place in capitalist societies unless they demonstrate incredible intellect. Being a merely average cripple myself, that's a bone of contention for me.

Socialism, while *horrendously* flawed, seems much less ethically distasteful than capitalism in every form that I've encountered it.

I just realized that this has turned into a debate, so I apologize profusely if you weren't looking to get into one tonight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, capitalism can be viewed as an outgrowth of feudalism. It's vast power in the hands of private individuals. It's hereditary wealth sustaining the upper classes. It's the few and the powerful owning and controlling the means of production. They're really quite similar, fundamentally speaking. In many parts of the world, the practical differences between capitalism and feudalism are more or less down to semantics. </TEXT>

You're paid, but when it's not in [scrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip) you're docked for things like food, healthcare, tools, training, and mandatory housing. What they charge you for these things often ends up costing more than you make. Happily, they have a solution for you. Just work off the balance of what you owe. But you never work it off. You'd leave, but some grubby sheik has your passport and the factory is locked. They've bought the cops and you don't know the language. So you're stuck.

The Confederate Battle Flag isn't so terrible. It was simply the banner of a group of men who fought back against what they saw as an invasion from the North and is therefore a perfectly valid symbol of rebelliousness and Southern heritage. It's the first national flag of the Confederacy that was forged by a bunch of slave owners for a government designed to keep black people in bondage. That one seems to get a pass, though. It's even in the state flag today as a 'compromise' from when people got offended about the '56 flag. It seems like a step backwards to me, but whatever. </TEXT>

I've seen all of five black people since I moved North and no latinos. They tend to stay in their own areas. In the South, whites, blacks, latinos, and everybody else mingled pretty freely.

<TEXT> My interpretation of the situation back in California is that the East Coast Brotherhood is on a much better material footing than the home chapter, but hasn't got as much in the way of leadership and strategic expertise. The DC Brotherhood simply lacks the scribes, Elders, and veterans that California has. So I think that it's tough to say that either one is really stronger, they just have different strengths.

That said, given the West Coast's political situation, I feel a lot less hopeful about the California Brotherhood's long term prospects than I do the DC Brotherhood's. </TEXT>

Your local Sea Org con artists would likely promise that by working up the bridge, you could gain the ability to walk. When you naturally failed at this, you would have to be reaudited.

<TEXT> I love the South and much like Cascadia and New England, I believe it deserves a regional flag of its own. However, the old symbols of the Confederacy are much too divisive to represent a region and its aspirations for the future. Therefore, I felt compelled to use what little graphic design skill I have to put forward a replacement.

The 13 stripes represent the 13 states usually associated with the South.

The three stars represent the past, which we must ever be mindful of; the present, whose importance needs no mentioning; and the future with all the promise it holds.

The triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts, symbolizing the desire most Southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love. This point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle.

What do you think? Comments and suggestions are much appreciated. I just wanted to have a flag that all Southerners - white, black, asian, and latin could fly proudly as a banner of their home region. 

EDIT: Might as well ask so I can tell what I'm doing wrong, but why's this topic suddenly getting downvoted? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The flag I was referring to is actually more broadly African than I thought, but it's Marcus Garvey's [Pan-African flag.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-African_flag)

I, too, had ancestors on both sides of the conflict and rather like a German who had ancestors in World War II, I'm proud of what my forebearers achieved, though not who they achieved it for. The Battle Flag might not be the most progressive emblem out there, but to me it characterizes my home, my ancestors, and my heritage. If there's a Confederate flag that's offensive, it's the first National Flag, but that seems to be viewed as the more benign flag for some reason. 

But this is dangerously close to devolving into a rant. I'm quite well read on the war and even moreso on its aftermath and lingering effects on the South and its development. I gather that you are, as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other than apocryphal stories I can tell you from my father and grandfather who often saw it displayed proudly by whites, blacks, and others throughout the South before the mid-eighties, I can point to its use in the armed forces [as seen here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#20th-century_popularity) and to its history as a symbol of rebellious elements of the New South from pop culture, such as the Dukes of Hazzard. Beyond that, though, I'm just a guy who likes the South and would rather not have the only distinctively Southern flag seen as a symbol of bigotry. I mean, if the Confederate Battle Flag is a symbol of evil then the US Flag certainly is, yet you can fly it without anybody batting an eye. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't seem to recall if the sign said that was the gas price specifically, as my resolution was shitty for that stream, but it doesn't have to be gas. Remember, many cars were running on nuclear fuel by then. My hypothesis (just off the top of my head) is that it was the price per gallon for reactor coolant, or possibly water. If the sign actually said "gasoline" it could even be a repurposed old gas sign considering the relative newness of nuclear cars.
Did the station have actual gas pumps? I can't remember.


Of course, the dollar may have been drastically revalued by then, though this is slightly unlikely given that a Cryslus Corvega costs "only" $199,999.99. Unless it's a super luxury car, a dollar may be worth about a quarter of what it is in the real world right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I consider myself an amateur with this stuff, so I can't speak to it as well as I'd like; but I'd consider acid weed's stronger older brother with more world experience and also he's probably been to other countries or something. As introspective and thought provoking as weed can be, it's also much more mellow (in my experience) and less powerful than acid. You can function, to an extent, after a joint. Acid, meanwhile, sort of forces you to sit back and observe and think. It's very powerful that way. You're really forced to take note of the trip and experience everything that's going on. It's definitely not to be taken lightly, but it's much more "magical." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really forces you to appreciate what a powerful and profound force neurochemistry is. Not a lot of people fully appreciate that, seeing as how very few people read about it and consider the various chemical compounds swirling around in our skulls. On a deeper level, it makes you consider the very essence of consciousness - that such a small dosage of a tasteless, odorless chemical can so drastically alter your perception. Years on, I still find myself returning to that first trip and considering it. It's something I'd recommend everybody (barring certain people with genetic histories of mental illness or of weak constitution) experience if for nothing else than the shift of perception it gives you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first time I ever tried acid was on a fluke. A friend of a friend had some and we found ourselves each with a hit of it. Nothing seemed to happen for the longest time after I put it in my mouth. I thought I'd been duped. But then, slowly, a sort of creeping magic overtook the surface of everything I looked at. Time and proportion seemed to fall away, or at least become less important. Insight and inspiration were behind every dust mote, and everything seemed to be either profound or hilarious. It was a wonderful experience and I consider myself fortunate to have had it.

EDIT: If you're going to try acid for the first time, the environment you're in and the people you're with are key to having a good trip. I was with my girlfriend (who I love dearly) in a clean room with Futurama on the TV. This is just about as good a setup as you can get. In retrospect, I'd have put some more interesting patterns on the wall to enjoy or some more fresh fruit on hand (it makes fruit taste AMAZING) but the point here is that [set and setting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are absolutely key here. </TEXT>

The on/in question is a wholly different matter, but it seems like people pushing for the English language to drop the article seem to be saying that we should think of their name as a Russian word rather than a Ukrainian word. 

I still just don't see it as being tied to the notion of a "Russian world" or other forms of revanchism. It's old fashioned, sure, but it also works much better aesthetically.  </TEXT>

You don't seem to be fimiliar with the history of the region. Most of the people there are ethnically Russian, everybody speaks Russian, and nobody there likes Kiev. It was only ever made Ukrainian for the administrative convenience of the GOSPLAN of the Central Soviet. Since there is no Central Soviet anymore, there's no reason for it to belong to the Ukraine. As a Ukrainian Crimea makes little sense and people living on Crimea are Russian, to call Crimea conquered is pandering to Kiev's perspective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Ukraine works just fine, is etymologically more correct, and really sounds better. The article was only dropped to apppease insecure nationalists who somehow thought the article was harming their national image. Insecure. 

Now, one thing you seem to be forgetting is that political maps are already rife with bias. Taiwan, for example, is nearly always shown in a different color than mainland China in the West's maps. This occurs despite the fact that under international law, there is only one China. In addition, the status of Kashmir tends to be up to whoever is printing the map that day and many maps are already showing the disputed nation of Kosovo.

Put simply, political maps are all about perspective, and de facto maps are better. 

Edit: Besides, if it's all about Russian perspectives, where's Transnistria? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. Just look at the huge amounts of output in Western animation ever since Flash became accepted. You have work that is in quite a few cases nearly indistinguishable from hand drawn being put out with a far lower expenditure of time, effort, and material at a much lower cost. Anime has been slow to adapt to these advances, but I think that as Japan as a whole is being forced to move away from older modes of thinking and acting, the traditional reticence that pervades many industries (including anime) will fall away by necessity and anime will adopt these new methods of production. </TEXT>

It looks like it's an M67. Perhaps it came from a South American country and was smuggled up? It's relatively small and border control tends to look for firearms over explosives, so it's not inconceivable that it ended up here. I'm not sure if any South American countries use the M67, though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lyrics from the comments section:

Chorus:

Wide is my Motherland,

Of her many forests, fields, and rivers!

I know of no other such country

Where a man can breathe so freely.



From Moscow to the borders,

From the southern mountains to the northern sea

A man stands as a master

Over his vast Motherland.



Throughout life, and freely and widely,

Just like the Volga flows.

The youth are always dear to us,

The old are always honoured by us.



Chorus



Our fields are too wide for the eyes,

Our cities are too many to remember,

Our proud word - comrade -

To us is higher than all fine words.



With this word everywhere we feel at home.

For us there are no blacks or coloureds.

This word is familiar to everyone,

With it we always find friends.



Chorus



Over the country, the spring breeze is blowing.

Every day life becomes more joyful,

And no one on earth could know

Our great ways of laughter and love.



But our brows shall frown sternly

If an enemy attempts to break us.

As a bride, we love our Motherland,

We protect her, as a gentle mother.


Chorus

<TEXT> Yep. They also used that song during the scene where the dictator is dancing with the globe. However, they cut it out mid way through during that scene as the globe bursts in his hands, just before the music swells to its climax. It is only allowed to finish during the Jewish peasant's speech at the end, providing a subtle thematic contrast that I missed the first few times I watched the movie. 

Given the Nazis' fondness for Richard Wagner, I found everything about the way they used Lohengrin in the film to be absolutely perfect. When evil men co-opt beautiful things, the artistic community has a duty to take such things back from them. This, I think, was done exceptionally in that film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure why you're being downvoted. Lincoln recontextualized the war to be about ending slavery after it proved unpopular at home. Llincoln was perfectly content to let the South keep its slaves, he just didn't want the dread institution to spread beyond where it already was. It didn't hurt that he was also eager to keep a solid market for Northern agricultural equipment under his thumb and had a keen, overarching sense of patriotism that made the notion of Southern sovereignty unthinkable to him. </TEXT>

In a way, a special and twisted way, one could imagine that Vader has assumed the mantle of Darth Traya. There must *always* be a Darth Traya, one that holds the knowledge of betrayal. Who has been betrayed in their heart, and will betray in turn.

Darth Krayt: Lord of Fury

<TEXT> Columbian biotech augmentations are certainly much less advanced. Granted, I feel like Suchong didn't do much better than Fink at making his abhuman creations, but he at least masked or sublimated their pain more effectively.

Then again, Fink being the ruthless, plagiarizing capitalist that he is, he probably just didn't care to copy anything but the essentials. There's the possibility that he couldn't get it working with Columbia's slightly less advanced laboratories and much more rigidly religious approach to the sciences, however. Maybe it's even a combination of these reasons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps I should say sapient? They don't ponder or wonder or imagine. They're clever, but they aren't sapient. Speaking of pain, you do know that plants can feel pain, right? They react to the stimulus of pain in some really interesting and shocking ways, it turns out. If we're using pain as a benchmark, we're going to have to learn to live off of solar energy or something.

Nice appeals to emotion, by the way. Emotion has no place in debate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the face of it, yes. However, government and charitable services in most areas have already got their hands full with the housed poor in public housing and section 8. Very few places have anything left over for the homeless.

Ideally, we should close tax loopholes for the bourgeoisie, cut military funding, and use the surplus to fund mental health clinics and social services and education so that the homeless problem can be dealt with in the long term; but the powers that be have decided that this won't be done. Therefore, I stand by my belief that feeding the homeless isn't necessarily a good idea. A short term solution is to donate whatever you can to your local homeless shelter and community centers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah. For some reason I had thought that the Quebecois had a flag wholly distinct from the provincial flag. I was wrong. Anyway, the South should have a flag because we're culturally distinct from the North. We've got a distinctive dialect, cuisine, styles of music and more. We've got a rich cultural history distinct from the rest of America and in most places, that's enough to warrant a flag. 

That you look down on the South as simply being distinct for slavery is rather telling of how much you know about us. I mean, by this *flawless* logic: 

The only difference between the South and North was slavery, so any flag that separates the South from the rest of the country will be looked at with considerable disdain. A regional flag would be looked at as a desire to be separate from the rest of the country, which is a pretty shitty message to send considering the reason for doing it the last time.

German nationalism is a bad thing, considering what it caused *last time.* American patriotism is a bad thing because of what it's caused. The South deserves a flag just as much as the US and Germany do, I think. You've not given me a single compelling reason why we don't. </TEXT>

I still rather like the South and the Confederate flag, even if we'd function poorly as a country and we revolted over slavery. It's just a shame that we were fairly objectively the bad guys, there. I mean, the North were genocidal, imperialist terrorists; so I don't guess there are any good guys in that war. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not denying that Russia's helping them out *a lot* more than they're admitting, but I think that the rebel movement did indeed start out from within. After all, Russians in Donetsk have been campaigning for independence [since December, 2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Republic_%28political_party%29); so it's not without merit. People had obviously wanted it from within, so it really matters little if Russia is helping them out.

Similarly, most Crimeans wanted no involvement with Kiev since 1992. What Russia did there was liberation, not annexation. The people wanted it, so Kiev's opinion is really moot.

With all that said, Russia's play in Novorossiya is really quite difficult to predict. Many experts in the field of defense analysis see them as wanting to fuel a perpetual destabilization of the region, a-la Abkhazia, Ossetia or Transnistria, in order to keep the Ukraine as a buffer state, as are Georgia (which I really wish we'd call Sakartvelo in English, but that's another matter) and Moldavia. Others see Putin as a Hitler-esque landgrabber who will add every former Soviet republic back into Russia and cement his place amongst the Tsars and Premiers.

It's really hard what to tell. He's made a lot of moves in a lot of different directions. I believe he thinks he's doing what's best for ethnic and linguistic Russians all over Eastern Europe and sees himself as a protector and restorer of [Greater Rus'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Russia). There's no doubt that he's deeply patriotic and his strong moral initiatives, however deeply wrong and misguided they may be, show a deep desire to guide the future of Russian society. 

My prediction is that if he could, he'd bring Russia's borders back to where they were in 1917. Since that's incredibly unrealistic, however, he'll likely be content to sieze parts of the former Soviet Union and destabilize neighboring countries as deeply as possible to keep NATO off his border while expanding the membership of [CSTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization), the [EEU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union), and the [CIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States) while expanding Russia's role and prestige within these groups for as long as he possibly can. The extent of that timeframe, however, is something I have no projections for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an adequate sentiment. I'm pretty sure camouflaging munitions flies in the face of some treaty or another, but I'm also pretty sure Russian armed forces weren't a party to said treaty. 

Anyway, I wasn't aware of such a kill record for the Bradley, but considering how many of them we had in theater and how outdated Iraqi armor was, I could quite believe it.

And you know, thinking about it, a lightly armored, upgunned, high speed tank that could be dropped out of a low flying C-130 to assist airborne infantry in rapidly destroying hostile objectives would be a sterling idea. I'd quite like to see that. It would be much more persistent than CAS missions or drone cover and the psychological impact of tanks in infantry warfare would make it a splendid piece of backup to augment any air deployed mission.

The only problem I could see would be getting it past acquisitions without having them butcher the thing.

Again, armchair military enthusiast. You probably know more about such things than I. Thanks for your service, by the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's fine as a light tank, I guess, but isn't its place in modern doctrine somewhat dubious? Light tanks aren't really a thing. Their role has been filled by so many other systems that the whole armor thing was surrendered to main battle tanks.

At least, that's my completely unprofessional armchair general evaluation. </TEXT>

The guy is a bigoted loon and his remarks show what I think is great insight into his thinking. Oh, and when you consider that most gun laws in the United States were enacted as tools to keep slaves and freedmen from liberating and protecting themselves, it doesn't set the best moral foundation for gun control as a movement.

NINJA EDIT: Let's not forget that these anti gun campaigners have armed bodyguards and famed anti gunner Dianne Feinstein not only owns a revolver but even has a concealed weapons permit. I think they just want to keep guns out of the hands of common people, the same sort of people who just so happen to often be asian, black, brown, and of other non-white ethnicities. Gun control is far more racist than gun rights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was anti-black sentiment everywhere. Still is. The South is just a lot easier to pin it on because it was much, much more visible here and because the Klan was founded here and lingered here a bit longer than it did in the Northeast. That's not to say that the north was free of racism, however. You've seen [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching#/media/File:ThomasShippAbramSmith.jpg) famous picture of a lynching, right? Marion, Indiana. 1930. 

Further, Martin Luther King, Jr led a famous march against housing discrimination (again, the main form it seems that non-Southern racism seemed to take) in Chicago, delivering this quote:

"Northern blacks were forced to live in a white man's democracy, and while not legally enslaved, subject to definition by their race. In their all-black communities, they continued to build their own churches and schools and to develop vigilance committees to protect members of the black community from hostility and violence."

[Here is a Wikipedia citation that has further examples of yankee racism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#In_the_North)

Now, again, publicly overt racism did linger a while longer in the South and persists still today in many parts south of the Mason-Dixon. However, the stereotyping of the South as the only racist region of the US is tremendously unfair to the region and all that we've done to bury these outmoded social mores.

I'd like to wager that we've come a long way, at least in my home state of Georgia. We've had black mayors in Atlanta for many years, black politicians elsewhere in the state, many of our wealthy and famous citizens are black, and we also sort of gave the world Martin Luther King, Jr. 

But this is all with somewhat scant research and just based off of conversations I've had with my grandparents about the era. While my expertise is history, I tend not to study social forces and racial dynamics as much as I study military history (principally of the US as a whole, the South, and Europe), so I will freely admit that I've got some details wrong. Therefore, you shouldn't consider this authoritative by any means. After all, I don't consider the Confederate battle flag by itself to be an evil thing and many take umbrage with that. (Note: the Confederate *national* flag is another matter and we really made a step backwards in Georgia by replacing our old flag with that.) That's another discussion, however, and I'm willing to bet that my premise of widespread racism is still quite certainly sound.

<TEXT> They certainly did in the north. They seemed to have a problem with that everywhere. But they didn't seem to get upset with how much money they had as long as black people weren't near them or around them. 

In the South, where pretty much everyone was poor anyway, it didn't seem to matter as much how close they lived - just as long as they weren't better off than white people *EDIT: or pursuing relationships with whites*. From what I've read and heard told, northerners were much more keen on keeping white parts of town white than that. But not knowing any old people from the north, I can't independently verify that. I just have my grandparents' stories to go off of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have heard it said that the north was just as bad as the South with racism, it was just expressed differently. In the South, for example, they wouldn't care how close black people got but it mattered how high they got. The inverse was true in the north.

In this system, the [Stakhanovite movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement), the work of many would be attributed to a single poster boy in the hopes that multitudes of workers would see said poster boy as a model to be emulated. The results of this were debatable, but it is certain that it was applied to more than just coal mining. </TEXT>

Theirs is an awful approach to activism that ends up hurting people who actually genuinely are on their side. Additionally, a lot of people can't afford to travel to Dragoncon and this is the only large genre convention of its size and type that we've got.

 You would be hard pressed to find anti gay sentiment at Dragoncon. Do something that'll hurt the republicans directly or something.

I'm probably going to get buried, but people need to consider the full ramifications of boycotts.

<TEXT> I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if we're going to have executions, they ought to be public. I am against the death penalty, as I don't believe any nationstate to have a perfect enough judicial process to mete it out fairly and it's an extremely expensive thing to have around.

However, it is a civil process, and every citizen of a country ought to see how the sausage is made, so to speak. As an element of the justice system, such as open courts where such executees are sentenced, it ought to be done in public. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My girlfriend's grandfather fought with the Communists against the Japanese in the war. I can confirm that they would hate it. We'd probably end up with a rump state headed by Wang Jingwei's Guomindang in China seated in Shanghai or perhaps Nanjing and the surrounding area with Japan owning a huge swatch of China including Manchuria, perhaps Beijing and most of the northern areas of the country. Additionally, they'd hold Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and more. 

Their vassal states in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere would hold Indochina, Burma, Indonesia, Singapore, and most if not all of British India. Look for Subhadra Bose and his Japanese backers to have some very different ideas on where the final borders should end up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to volunteer at the Maryland zoo. One of the polar bears in our zoo, Alaska, was born in captivity and was in a circus for all of her life. She was rescued and my mentor described what it was like when she first entered her exhibit. The first time she entered her exhibit was literally the first time in her life that she had ever set foot on the earth so, for the first week or so she loved to dig. It was very endearing and touching...until they realized she was digging way too much and they had to fill in the holes at night with a mini tractor and compact the earth. And when she first went for a swim in the pool in her exhibit she was even happier. It was amazing! Unfortunately she has died due to old age and kidney failure.

Where are they all going to go to the bathroom, for example? Where will they sleep? How are you going to deal with the increased crime, vagrancy and litter that inevitably follows groupings of homeless people? The actions taken to discourage homeless gatherings by some cities is understandable, but it also has to come with a program of humanitarian assistance: the construction and expansion of shelters and resources to get these people fed and in jobs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Privilege is a vague concept, at best. It does little to explain rampant poverty in predominantly white rural Appalachia, for example. It also does little to explain why social justice people seem to care so little for that cause, or for things like male mental health. Privilege is an interesting theory in abstract but makes little sense in the real world.

I say this as a disabled man, someone you'd probably consider unprivileged.  </TEXT>

As for the whole criminal justice thing, it actually is something of a source. It shows that I know what I'm talking about to a degree when it comes to police firearms training procedures.

<TEXT> Yep. Nazi chic. In Japan and East Asia, nobody was really all that affected by the holocaust, so they look at Nazis as little more than bad guys who did bad things and looked fantastic doing them. Due to their detachment from the situation, it's seen merely as taboo and not endorsing racism and genocide to enjoy Nazi chic. Oh, and the swastika never got ruined over there.

This is a gross over simplification, of course, so if anyone wants to correct me on this, feel free. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, looks like I've got some reading to do. I agree with you in the functioning of militaries in the modern world, as well. Sadly, armed forces are more often sink pits for surplus population and wealth that could be much better used in much better pursuits. This is not unique to the DPRK. The US does it, most European nations do it. Sure, there's military actions in these states, but it's often to the ends of amoral puppet masters and not to the ends of the national interest. Rather like the DPRK, though in a grander scale and different guise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. For example, I'm sure that whoever founded Nestle had no idea they'd become the amoral bastards they are today. I'm sure that the founders of the Republican and Democratic parties had no idea they'd allow America to become what it is today. And I am abundantly certain that the old Bolsheviks came to rue what became of their revolution. Movements can certainly lead quite far from where they're intended to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can understand the moral side to this, but from a practical perspective, the North Korean military isn't a fighting force. It's a social institution which rarely wields martial power as it knows that any sort of war they fight is a losing proposition. Instead, it's an internal control mechanism which exists to scare people into line and run camps. I highly doubt that 16 year olds are given rifles and told to shoot people. More likely, they're learning to shoot and parade around and basically nothing more.

Further, the military is likely the best route most North Koreans have for getting regular meals. To say nothing of medical care and possible opportunities for education and social advancement within the wretched *Songbun* system that military service affords. 

So, while I abhor the DPRK regime, letting 16 year olds into the North Korean military is acceptable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not talking about specific firearms models (and he features plenty of actual firearms in Metal Gear). I'm talking about things like trigger discipline and proper detailing, with adequate consideration given to things like actually fitting a mechanism in the design of a fake gun. You can draw any sort of gun you like, but drawing one with a believable location to hold the thing and put a magazine in it that will have the right amount of room to feed into the chamber and a believably placed trigger mechanism is quite another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Philippines has a claim on the islands there too. If it was still part of the US, that means the American Navy would be there to enforce those claims.

I agree entirely. However, we could also look for the Communist Chinese to build a much stronger navy. The [PLAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy) has, until recently, been something of a red headed step child amongst the Chinese armed forces. Naturally, the Military Commission had been rather keen on the advantages of a true blue water navy for some time, but until very recently the technical expertise and vast resources necessary to create and maintain such a force had eluded them. 

However, in the past twenty years, China's economy has exploded and (coupled with the opening up of former Soviet technical expertise) the Chinese have been able to acquire the backbone of a true blue water fleet. Where once they had been able to field a token submarine force, they're now able to field carriers and light cruisers. 

Now, back to the What If. One imagines that with a US territory not too far off and their Nationalist rivals licking their wounds on Taiwan, Mao might look at a Navy as a much more vital asset. The Communists might even have looked to their friendship with the Soviets in a more careful light and worked harder to placate Khrushchev in an effort to avoid the Sino-Soviet split, thus ensuring that Soviet naval power (which was far from inconsiderable) would come into play in the West Pacific. This is all highly speculative, naturally, but the naval situation alone could pose for scores of HistoryWhatIfs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Underwater, you mean? Andrew Ryan was an incredibly successful businessman topside. In a museum located at Ryan Amusements, the story of the voyage (and subsequent refitting for ocean floor construction) of Ryan's private ocean liner The Olympian is detailed, along with the hard work of Ryan's private army of laborers. These laborers were given places in Rapture for their trouble (and, one assumes, to preserve Rapture's secrecy) but were forced to settle in the maintenance tunnels beneath the Atlantic Express rail lines, now known as Pauper's Drop.

In other words, a lot of the Family Splicers that Delta murdered there are the men who built Rapture. Thanks, Delta. Jackass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rapture employed a system of fog emitting shrouds to keep people from finding the lighthouse which served as its entrance. Of course, during the initial startup phase, there were problems: mass dieoffs of fisheries, oil slicks, and the like. However, as Rapture's defensive systems (torpedoes, mines, inferred anti-air capabilities) resulted in disappearances of shipping and aircraft that remained unexplained to the wider world - coupled with the extremely inhospitable nature of the frigid North Atlantic meant that a large swatch of sea was left quite avoided: cursed to the superstitious and commercially dead to the rational.

As it was never a particularly well travelled region of ocean in the first place, nobody really felt the loss for this and, by design, Andrew Ryan's shining utopia achieved perfect isolation from the outside world... barring the errant daredevil diver or a domestic situation that would make Jerry Springer gasp. Otherwise, Rapture marches on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I imagine it would be a similar situation, but with far more pressure for either independence or statehood given the Philippines' substantially larger population. I'd really like to see how having a large US territory in that region would impact relations between the Communist and Nationalist China. I'm sure Chiang Kai Shek would have been more confident in his position with so many more US Forces swarming around in the Pacific. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While it is very restrictive (not all that unusually so for nations on the Asian continent), it is distinguished by having successfully unified China (for the first time since the downfall of their last dynasty) and having done more for literacy and human development in China than anyone else. For these reasons, the Communist party is not without its supporters.

Not sure why communist is used as though it's a bad thing. Ever read Marx? Communism is, at its heart, a very good and benevolent philosophy - much moreso than capitalism.

Also, the Guomindang are the Nationalist Chinese, the ones currently in exile (for the most part, see: The Revolutionary Committee of the Guomindang) on Taiwan. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I'm looking to make a mod... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-14 03:34:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Basically, I have a shitload of obscure music from the Communist world of varying vintages, a level of skill at writing stiffly propagandistic radio copy, and a degree of experience with voice work. What I'd love to do is make a radio station for either FNV or FO3 that broadcasts as a service of the irradiated ghouls shambling around in the old Soviet embassy.

If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, let me know. I really only need someone with enough GECK know how to make all the audio that I level and produce to come out fine in the script and in game. As I have no plans to make any in game content, it should be a modest undertaking at its most difficult.

If such a mod already exists, I apologize for the seeming redundancy, but I'd dare to venture that my effort would make a worthy and immersive addition to any play through of either game.


UPDATE

I've recorded several DJ quips and have a nearly finalized selection of tracks I'm putting in. This is subject to change, and if you have any suggestions feel free to speak up. Chances are that I probably have it.

**Soviet:**

My Army

There, Far Beyond the River

If You'll Be Lucky

Lenin is Young Again

On the Hills of Manchuria

Russian Sailors Dance

Pesnaya

Lenin is Always With You

War Century

Na Strazi Mira

Anebopok

The Rockets Are Always Ready!

Ne Plach Devchonka

Kiev Waltz



**Chinese:**

When That Day Comes

Chen Sisi: My Dear Chinese People

When The Motherland Calls Upon Us

The East Is Red

Socialism is Good!

Unknown Mao Zedong Red Opera



**East German:**

Ernst Busch: The Left March

Erich Weinert Ensemble: Spartakus In Berlin


**North Korean:**

The General Is Seen at the Outpost

Don't Ask My Name

We Will Follow You Forever

Korea Does What It is Determined to Do

Footsteps

Where Are You, Dear General?


**Hungarian:**

A Parttal A Neppel

This list is very much in flux and open to suggestion. I may add or remove things in order to create the right tone for the station. Additionally, if you have requests for things you want to hear the DJ talk about and put a commie spin on, feel free to suggest them here. 

**Preview**

A preview of the mod is located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkC6gsMCLzY)


**UPDATE 01/15**

Principal recording of DJ lines is complete. Track listing is complete. All that remains is placing and some audio post-production. I'm quite pleased with how everything has come together, and I'm pretty sure it even plays nice with canon and lore. I'll make another post once the whole thing is done, and I hope you all enjoy it.

To celebrate this milestone, [here](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1wZJvPoQRxa) is another preview of the DJ copy.

<TITLE> Cockney people: the tragic, untold story </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-02 20:32:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Britain's cockney culture is characterized by a charming accent that is famous the world round for evoking images of chimney sweeps and Dickensian orphans. HOWEVER, there is an untold tragedy behind this distinctive brogue.

You see, the cockney tradition of calling strangers 'guvna' does not, in point of fact, stem from rhyming slang and the archaic term 'scrivener.' In fact, all cockney people suffer from a terrible and debilitating condition that leaves them unable to properly identify the current governor. Therefore, in a mixture of respect and a fear of terrifyingly draconian British laws regarding the failure to pay proper deference to government officials, cockneys are left with but one recourse:

Greet everyone as 'guvna.' </TEXT>

<TITLE> Let's Talk Cat Declawing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-05 19:37:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've long been of the belief that cat declawing is an awful thing to do to the animals. The bulk of evidence I've seen seems to agree with this point of view, and it's been gaining a lot of supporters as of late.

HOWEVER: it would seem as though the American Veterinary Medical Association and several other reputable veterinary groups disagree with this assertion. While I tend to agree with scientific and medical establishments, there's no doubt that there's money to be made on declawing, so it seems as though they've got something at stake here. Add to that that the American anti-declawing movement originated in hippy-esque circles which aren't really known for their adherence to science, and I have doubts. 

I was wondering where the skeptic community falls on this issue and if there were any resources out there that might make a case for declawing not being harmful. </TEXT>

In the viral game Something in the Sea, we are shown that the initial construction of Rapture (with stage I being completed in late 1946) is financed by shell companies such as Warden Yarn who buy large quantities of materiel from Scarlet Sovereign with these contracts then being reneged upon receipt of the raw materials. 

This presents a problem, however. With Ryan disappeared to Rapture and his shell companies on the surface surely made pariahs by his lack of payment on large contracts, he was surely cut off from receiving raw materials from sources on the surface. However, we're told that Rapture continued to expand until 1951. This surely would have required a vast amount of material well in excess of the sums we're shown in the Scarlet Sovereign receipts. Further, any civic planner worth a damn would have a setup for procuring additional materials for repairs and expansion to keep pace with population growth.

Now, as we're not shown any sort of method by which Rapture can quarry stone or mine ores and the trees in Arcadia are surely insufficient for providing lumber in addition to oxygenating the city, I've got to wonder: where did the additional raw materials for Raptures maintenance and expansion come from?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a tremendous fondness for 9x18mm and the general idea of compact-ish combloc pistols really holds a dear place in my heart and in my hands. However, no gun store or pawn shop seems to have them and I prefer to avoid dealing with online purchases - even though they seem to lack these pistols as well. 

And so, I turn to /r/gunsforsale. I would like to offer some delicious leafy green cashy money to anybody in the Gainesville, GA area who might be willing to sell me one of these weapons. I am highly negotiable on prices, and I can start at $120 for a PA-63. More for a Makarov PM or CZ-82. I also have a genuine Soviet Tokarev without importer stamps that I could be persuaded to trade, if you prefer. 

Shoot me a reply if you're interested! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-05-12 04:45:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am currently unemployed and in the Atlanta area - just north of the city, OTP, and I'm looking for work. On the writing front, I've written gaming reviews and articles for massvio.com and gamegeex.com, as well as reams of unpublished poetry and short form fiction. I'll write just about anything, really, though articles are my forte.

As for voice acting, I'm just breaking into it though I have - as a matter of curiosity - received some informal coaching and advice on the matter from Mike Dowling, audio lead at Obsidian Entertainment. 

Really, I'm willing to do anything else that pays as long as it isn't too physical, as I'm a paraplegic amputee. However I am much more capable than most people would think. Don't be shy, drop me a PM!

I'd put my resume here, but I haven't got any prior work history beyond my writing and I tend to keep my portfolio closed to all but serious enquirers. I assure you, however, that I am highly qualified for a wide variety of tasks. Should you chose to grant me some form of interview, I promise you'll come away from the experience quite impressed. Of this, you can rest assured. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Request] The Soviet Confederacy of America </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-23 04:56:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 1863, the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade is routed at Gettysburg, dissolving in a disorganized retreat from Confederate military forces under General Robert E. Lee after a decisive Confederate cavalry raid by General JEB Stuart breaks the Union forces in the area. 

With the road to Washington wide open, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, signs the Confederate drafted Instrument of Surrender which recognizes the right of the Confederate States of America to exist and protects the legal right of states to leave the Union as they so choose. Over night, Confederate governments spring up in the border states and the economic and military power of the United States slides slowly into irrelevance. After several decades of Union losses and Confederate gains in the West and in the Caribbean and Mexico, the Confederacy enters the 20th century as the dominant power in North America.

In the 1930s, the South falls on hard economic times as the world plunges into the Great Depression. The South's former slaves, freed by act of President Gustave Tutant Beauregard in 1917 in reaction to fears of reaction by anarchist radicals, are still horribly oppressed and are now denied even the meager wages of the sharecropping farms that have gone under in reaction to decreased demand from factories in Europe and the border states of the Confederacy. Uniting with prominent Southern Communists and dissatisfied veterans of the Confederate actions against Mexico in World War I, they march on Richmond and seize the capitol, executing President Thomas Hardwick and installing a vanguard party, headed by a Stalinst strongman to oversee the Confederacy. 

On 5, May 1932, The Confederate States are reorganized into The Soviet Confederacy of America; a Workers' state in direct alliance with the Soviet Union. All they need now... is a flag.

tl;dr - supposing in an alternate history, the Confederacy stuck around long enough to be overthrown by commies. What would their flag look like?


I've always loved the symbolism of Communist countries and the Confederate States of America. Had I an eye for design and a better computer, I'd puzzle out what this flag might look like myself. I don't. What I do have, though, is imagination. With this short, plothole riddled alternate history yarn, I hope that /r/vexillology can whip up a flag that would bring this improbable nation more vividly into the imagination. Thanks! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-10-10 21:32:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the 2005 film adaptation, I believe the original intent of the book has been altered somewhat. When we first see a tripod, a tremendous noise is heard emanating from its carapace. I believe this to be the flatulence of the alien pilots, who have left their homeworld to pass wind in order to be polite. I have evidence to back up my theory.

1. The plants: these aren't for terraforming, as one might think. The aliens just have bad hygeine and the mushrooms that grow in their bathrooms left spores that follow them to Earth.

2. The fact that everyone is screaming and running away. I don't know about you, but I'd love to hang out with a giant alien robot... unless it was farting.

My final evidence is the most important fact on which this theory hinges. At the end, all the tripods collapse and the aliens within fall out and die. To me, this clearly shows that their own fumes were so noxious that it killed them.

I'll take my internet points, now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Soundtracks </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-04 08:34:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> New subscriber here, come from a fit of nostalgia that got me back into the franchise as of late. One thing I've always found appealing about the series was the soundtrack, especially in the original Metal Gear Solid.

My question here is this, though. Why did TAPPY stop handling the soundtracks? To me, the music contributed to a sense of atmosphere that none of the subsequent games could ever recapture, even when MGS4 [revisited Shadow Moses Island](/spoiler). Was a reason ever given for this or is it left as mysterious as the exclusion of the FAMAS from subsequent games? 

Again, Harry Gregson-Williams was just fine but his music made the latter games feel somewhat disconnected from the first Metal Gear Solid. It's nothing against him, he's just not TAPPY. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, Reddit. I am train_subject1458. I decided to do an AMA as I am getting into voice acting and I'd love very much to have a decent demo tape to use. However, I'm not necessarily the most creative sort so I thought I'd ask my favorite internet community to help me out a bit. 

So here's how we play this game. You leave me a quote - anything within reasonable length - and I'll render it for you in my glorious voice or else in my best approximation of a voice of your choosing. 

Some details, first, though. 
I am a 22 year old man from Georgia, in the United States. I can do passable high status British, genteel Southern, modern redneck, Morgan Freeman, and so many, many other voices. If you can name it, I'll give it the old college try. 

Ready? Alright, then. Let us begin.

<TEXT> I recently acquired an RAI 1911 tactical and, while I couldn't be happier with it, the slide is not to my liking. I'd always admired the look of GI-style 1911 slides and even though the sight picture is inferior, I think I'd like to trade if anyone is willing. 

My slide has some light finish wear, so I'm willing to accept less than pristine slides. If anyone is interested, please let me know!

<TEXT> I'm 22 and I'm in a wheelchair. This Saturday, I'm flying across the country to see my fiancee who I've not seen in months. Now, I should be elated, but instead I can't help but be incredibly fucking nervous. Why?

The Transportation Security Administration, the people we Americans tolerate so willingly for the illusion of feeling safe are going to absolutely violate me. I am certain of this. Why? Well, they haven't got the best track record with people in general, but add to it that they [have](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zFi18ioqYk) [a](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2116881/TSA-subject-child-wheelchair-invasive-airport-security-tests-Chicago.html) [shitty history](https://gripevine.com/gripe/20731929/tsa-agents-abuse-disabled-travelers-pbi-west-palm-beach-airport) in dealing with disabled persons, I can't help but feel intimidated. I look at how we're willing to just accept this from my government as our economy continues to implode and I can't help but weep. I can't fight, but I can't help but feel I'd sympathize with and possibly even join up with a populist uprising if ever we had one. 

So my question to you is this. What would the government have to take from *you* to make you tell them that enough is enough? </TEXT>

_________________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: I'm campaigning for modship. Go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/r5fnd/requesting_modship_of_rgirlsinyogapants/) and upvote to show your support. I and those on my side will fix what our current mods ignore.

____________________
EDIT 2: As [douglasg14b](http://www.reddit.com/user/douglasg14b) has pointed out, the mod request post has been deleted. I do not theorize this to be as a result of foul play, but as a result of a spam filter of some kind reacting to the piles of upvotes we've thrown at the post. I am thankful for the community's support, and if I and the others make it in, I promise that we'll give you the best subreddit possible. 

Thank you,

<DATE> 2012-03-14 14:19:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The gun show is on Saturday and I've got $250 to get a new handgun and I want your opinions. Here are my criteria:

* Steel frame
* Semi auto
* External hammer
* Manual safety
* Compact
* Affordable ammunition
* Rugged

Caliber and recoil are secondary concerns as I've got some pretty good arms on me and my shot placement is decent enough at self defense ranges so I don't need excessive stopping power. 

I should also say that I'd like something that would hide on a wheelchair fairly well. Paraplegic here, so wheelchair carry demands compactness and reliability. 

My frontrunner so far is a milsurp CZ82, but I'm open to suggestions. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but about a month or so ago, my brother's girlfriend broke up with him. Ever since, he's taken it incredibly hard. He's utterly inconsolable and it seems no one can really get through to him. 

I've tried chatting with him about it, having had my share of lady troubles in the past, but it's no good. He had once confided in me while they were still together that he saw them as being quite serious. I played it off as him being a high-schooler and thus given to such fancies, but it's obvious that he cared deeply for her. 

I don't want him to continue being so depressed, Reddit, as he's exceptionally bright, his terrific grades have begun to falter somewhat, and he's got a full ride scholarship that I fear he may be jeopardizing. 

Help me get my brother through this, guys. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For me, it has to be 922r. What practical purpose could it serve to limit the amount of foreign parts you have on an arbitrarily defined "assault weapon?" I think the rationale is to prevent the importation of military style weapons, but there are a plethora of US made parts that render this purpose moot. It's absolutely retarded. 

Does anyone else agree or can you come up with a worse law? </TEXT>

     a. Are there any Communist organizations in Georgia?
   
     b. Are there any [/r/Communism](/r/Communism) readers in the state? 


2. What is the best way to spread Communist ideas in such a traditionally anti-Communist region?

3. What is the best way for one in such a politically isolated area to contribute to the cause of the Proletariat? 

4. Finally, is there any suggested reading for someone in this dicey political climate?

<TITLE> A question for /r/progressive </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-12-31 02:27:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I consider myself a liberal and I have for quite some time. The Left's advocacy for egalitarian treatment for all, social services and better living conditions while advancing human rights is just common sense, to me, and the Left seems to be the only end of the spectrum concerning itself with these noble goals.

However, I have noticed that the one right that progressives by and large tend to ignore is firearm rights. So, my question, being a left winger who is also a firearms enthusiast, is this: why are so many progressives anti-gun? Aren't firearms the last line of defense people have against their government? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, /r/Atlantans! I'm engaged but in a long distance relationship and next month, my lovely fiancee is coming to Atlanta. I myself try to get to Atlanta every chance I get, but I am not in town often enough to know any of the good restaurants to which I could treat her and I don't know which ones would be accessible for my wheelchair. Further, we are somewhat strapped for cash as college is very expensive and most of our spare funds are spent on airfare whenever we can get it.

Therefore, I would like /r/Atlanta's advice. What would be an accessible and reasonably priced, yet delicious and memorable dining experience to which I could treat my beloved? 

BONUS: You might remember us if you went to the Dragoncon meetup. We were [these](http://i.imgur.com/YynFY.jpg) people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With the recent transgressions against the peaceful protests, the brutality of the corporate police and the unwillingness of OWS moderators to allow discussion of anything but the most bleeding hearted pacifism, I think a new platform is needed to discuss - purely hypothetically and without any limitation - how we should proceed if the peaceful protesters continue to be ground into the dirt by police. 

Sure, it's just Atlanta and Oakland now, but what next? Do you really think Bloomberg will let the protesters stay on Wall Street for long? I do not advocate violence, but surely we've enough freedom left in this country to spread the word that we don't have to be docile little bitches for our corporate lords, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't even know if this is the right place to ask this, but I was wondering if anybody in the area would like to buy my old Soviet Army uniform. 

It's in perfectly good shape, but I've got bills to pay and I bought it at a point where, well... I didn't have bills to pay. It's of 1980s vintage and hasn't been worn since the Communications Bureau in Ukraine divested itself of it.

It includes the jacket and pants. The jacket is sized 51 centimeters at the chest and the pants have no sizing information, but should fit anyone who can fit into the jacket. I am selling it for $125, but the price is negotiable. Let me know if you're interested!

<TITLE> A nearly impossible question... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-09-22 14:05:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I'm disabled: a through the knee amputation that requires me to use a wheelchair. Here's the kicker, though: I love urban exploration and have always wanted to give it a try. However, abandoned buildings tend not to have working elevators and since they're generally very old, they almost always lack ramps where they're needed. So my question is this: can anyone think of a way to go urban exploring while in a wheelchair? 

Miscellaneous, helpful information: I am fairly mobile outside of my chair, though it's restricted to crawling and that's not wise in crumbling ruins, and my chair is manual so I don't have to charge it or anything. 

I know this is an unusual question and I'm honestly not expecting a miracle here, but if anyone has any information at all, I'd consider it a boon. Thanks for reading! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've not really posted here much, but my fiance has; so bear with me if you don't mind. 

As you are all, I'm sure, acutely aware; the night is the absolute worst time of day to be missing your lover. It isn't so bad during the day, because I can text or call her and she texts and calls me. At night, though, as I try to sleep, I feel her absence very keenly - as though a part of me were missing. After noticing we were both on Google+, I texted her and we chatted for a while on Skype and she missed me as horribly as I missed her. This is a common course of events.

I want to know, /r/LongDistance, if you have any tips to alleviate our longing for each other. Is there anything we can do or - perhaps - send each other to make our beds feel less empty at night?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have noticed, when looking at pictures of countries outside of North America and Western Europe that there seems to be no care given to public access for disabled people. I am very curious as to why this is the case, as at some point in the future I would love to travel. 

I know this is a very broad and general question, but it seems like if the United States - as backwards as we are in accommodating those outside the mainstream - can make laws mandating access for handicapped persons, other countries might do the same. I would love to hear what anyone might have to say on the matter. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There was a picture that was presented twice, the first time being pirates storming a ship with something to the effect of "We're here for yer booty." And the words: How most people view piracy.

The image was again repeated, the second time saying something like "How it really is" with the pirate captain stating "We be here to make copies of all yer cargo." Of note was a toothless pirate scab saying something to the effect of "Where be the amputee porn?" Or something. Anyone got this?

<TEXT> Dear Reddit,

This was a difficult year for me. I had a surgery and spent months in recovery. However, through it all I had Reddit - a fun site suggested to be by one of my best friends a few months prior. This year would have been a nightmare without the fantastic community and amusing links that this site has to offer. 

As we head into 2011, I can only hope that every Redditor has a wonderful year and the best of fortune and health. So thanks again, Reddit. You're the top!

[The Legendary Lost Bathroom Reader](http://i.imgur.com/eqcBK.png?9955) (I had several of these books as a kid and loved them. What a coincidence!)

[An impossible crossword revealing the identity of my Santa and

USB Drive of awesome (with impossibly great music and stencils and such onnit.)

LED light thingy.

Last, and perhaps greatest of all - [A WHOLE WEEKEND OF DRAGONCON, THE GREATEST CONVENTION EVER.](http://i.imgur.com/FSgoV.png?1072)

All this within an intricately designed box that has been eagerly awaited after my first Reddit secret santa experience. (Easily the most fun I've had with a secret santa!)

Thanks again, Santa! I'll solve your puzzle eventually!

EDIT: I did not realize that this music on the USB was original! Upon finding the README note, however, I have decided to point this out. Great stuff, SS!

EDIT2: Identity uncovered! All thanks go to [Mrpaulmanton!](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mrpaulmanton/) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2010-09-04 04:37:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings Reddit. It's story time. 

A few months ago, I had a fairly complicated surgery that required an extensive recovery. I persevered, however; by maintaining that I would be able to go to Dragoncon, my absolute most favourite convention ever, and room with a woman whom I absolutely adore and hang out with some great friends. I pinned all of my hopes during recovery on enjoying four days in the heart of Atlanta in a state of constant nerdgasm. This was not to be.

Tonight, at the close of the first day of the convention, I have gotten ill and must return home. I feel absolutely horrible and I needed to vent. Thanks for reading, Reddit. I don't give a shit how you vote, I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with shit like this lately. I know it isn't the biggest thing in the world to lose sleep over, but this is literally the sole thing that kept me even mildy sane over the past few months. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2010-07-25 21:57:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been having an issue with my WASR 10. I got it yesterday as a get well present from my father, and I have yet to shoot it. It's brand new, sealed in box. My problem is that the military issue double stack magazine it comes with is a tight fit into the receiver. 

If it helps, this is a GP, no ban WASR-10, so it's not like I have to use single stack mags or anything. I can tell, based on the 'arrow in triangle' stamp on the receiver, that this rifle is made from former military parts. It also came with the Tapco G2 trigger group installed.

Other than this mag problem (which doesn't completely prevent me from inserting the mag, it just makes it an annoyance) I love the thing and can't wait to get well enough to shoot it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I decided to be the pro-gun guy in a thread in the general reddit. This is, of course, a terrible idea, but I felt it was warranted. Now, people are downvoting me without even bothering to engage me in a serious debate about firearms. Could someone comment and at least make it appear as if I'm not some lone gun freak?

[Here is the comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/caste/shooting_spree_in_uk_leaves_12_dead/c0ra6vr)

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who has upvoted, but a serious debate on the effectiveness of British gun laws has yet to arise. The karma was not my issue. My problem with the post lay in the lack of discussion.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> AN ODDLYNORMAL REDDITOR ANSWERS 20 QUESTIONS </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-05-15 00:51:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Age: 20

Sex: Male

Location : Due to ongoing arguments with the alleged "Church" of Scientology, I will go no further than stating Georgia.

Occupation : Student

Hobbies/Interests : Science, science fiction, the Internet, old jazz, literature, anime, firearms, and gaming.

What websites do you find most useful : Well, Reddit of course. I also frequent wikipedia and (until my friends leave it) Facebook.

Favourite music/movies: I'm really into the Ink Spots right now, and my favourite film of all time might be Hitchcock's Notorious. I also enjoy early George Lucas and, more modern, I liked The Invention of Lying.

Nature of your disability: Spina Bifida of the L2 vertibrae. Right leg amputation. Solitary kidney. Fortuitously, I lived far in excess of the doctors' original estimations and didn't have to have any form of potentially brain damaging fluid shunts which are so common with my condition.

Were you born disabled: Yes.

Has disability had an impact on your spiritual life, if you have one: I am an atheist. I don't think it has anything to do with my disability, I just don't find the Judeo-Christian concept of an omnipotent, omniscient *AND* loving god to be at all logical.

Are you easily offended by disability jokes : Offended? Ha! I make them all the time!

How active are you in the disabled community: This is my first real activity in the community.

How do you deal with getting more attention than the rest of your family: I just do. I mean, no one is bothered about it, even when I ask. Either they're great liars or they don't care. If they don't care, why should I?

Do you ever have dreams where you aren't disabled at all: Not really. I think it's because I've always been disabled.

Have you ever damaged someone who was trying to help you: Yes, but I'd rather remain private on that one if suits everyone just fine.

Tell us about the time you most shameless exploited your disability to get something: Every year, I go to dragoncon - a regional sci-fi convention. Now, the able bodied amongst us have to wait for hours on line to get their tickets. Me? I take my friends straight through admissions with my mighty feeb powers!

How do you cope with well-meaning idiots: Grin and bare it. After all, they're trying, aren't they? That's better than apathy or outright hatred.

What is your most-developed talent: My writing. I used to play trumpet, but I've fallen out of practice.

What would you like the people around you to do differently: Nothing, really. I mean, nobody really treats me like I'm disabled, so I don't care. Sure, strangers try to be polite and hold doors for me, but I think it could be much worse.

Best piece of advice you can pass on: Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things.

I hope that my filling this out will encourage any lurkers to tell their stories. We, the mods, have set up this questionnaire for the benefit of this subreddit and its users, and we hope that you all enjoy it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Here's my story. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-05-14 02:57:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was born with Spina-Bifida, fairly minor, though I am confined to a chair. I also have severe scoliosis which resulted in one of my kidneys failing to form. Further complications meant that I later lost my leg (not that it was really an issue, as the leg refused to respond to any nerve stimuli) when I was 5.

Anyway, I was quite fortunate in that I didn't have to have a shunt performed and I never required too much care or assistance. I am also fortunate in that I am self sufficient and that having no use in my legs has given me pretty good upper body strength. Anyway, that's the extent of my disability - for all of its pros and cons. Has anyone got anything similar? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm at wit's end, reddit. I really like her, I'm not sure, as I've never cared for anyone so deeply, but I think I even love her. She said she wanted someone more serious, willing for marriage and to have a child. I would have done this for her, but alas, I could not keep the relationship. Is there any way to fix this? Or have I lost this forever? I need help, here. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dear Reddit, my parents are going to discover I have a girlfriend. Please help me! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2009-12-27 02:07:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think a little bit of background may be necessary. In fact, I know it is necessary, as only like one guy on here knows me IRL. 

So, I am 19 and due to the positively shite economy, I live with my parents. My parents always get to the mail due to the fact that I am in a wheelchair. Normally, a harmless (if suffocating) arrangement. 
Now, the last time my parents found out I had a girlfriend, they were extraordinarily happy. Not the sort of happy that's fun, either. The sort where they throw fits and constantly interrogate you as to the location of the apple of your eye, the object of your desires, she who hung the moon for you. To go through this again, dear Reddit, is an unacceptable proposition.

I had gone to dragoncon with the last girl I dated, and we both decided to keep it professional. We're friends, we decided, nothing more. Soon after, a good friend from high school decided to ask me out. She is extremely pretty and has always been extremely kind to me. I would be most foolish to decline. The issue is, however, her mother is the extremely controlling sort who speaks little English and insists that her daughter not date, so I rarely get to see her. 

NOW, the point. For Christmas, she decided to mail me my present. For all I know, it could be something extraordinarily embarrassing that could only be from a girlfriend. If my parents discover this, I would have to have yet another relationship out in the open. It's not like I'm ashamed or anything, all my friends know. 

Anyway, I beseech thee, Reddit. What should I do!?

EDIT: I am abundantly aware of my affinity for the comma and my propensity towards run-on sentences. I also have pictures of both of us, should you need them.

ANOTHER EDIT: Wow, you guys are great. I was expecting this to languish for days without any reply. Imagine my surprise to find so much advice so quickly!

STILL ANOTHER EDIT: Pics were requested.

ME: http://imgur.com/gDhBX Sorry, but it's a couple of months old and my most recent. My camera's been a bit shit lately. I'm the one in the pic who isn't Malcolm McDowell.


RESULT: Due to the wise council of my fellow redditors, I have decided to man up and just put it on the table. I shall tell them and get it over with whilst informing them that they have a tendency to be rather annoying in their querying. I thank you all very much for your input.

<TEXT> I mean, really. This is ridiculous. I come to reddit to read about things that matter. Tangible, real things. Not some rich athlete smashing his expensive SUV. That doesn't affect me or the real world. It is not legitimate news. It is a product of our celebrity obsessed culture and a symptom of society's degradation. I expect this to get downvoted. Let it come.

<TITLE> About a month ago, I was worried about Co$ opening in my county. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/9p8eo/scientology_may_be_opening_in_my_county_how_can_i/

The happy news is that the building permit was denied. Fliers were handed out in my community detailing the crimes of the cult, letters were written to the county council members, and members of the appropriate city councils. I had other (legal) tactics for each step of the construction should it have come to that, but thankfully they were stopped. I and my friends in the area remain vigilant, but for now my county is free of the cult's taint and we can all breathe a little easier around here. 

I would like to thank my fellow redditors as well as the whyweprotest and Chanology forums for all of their help. We have won this battle, and the war shall be ours! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just don't get it. Our government has been running out of control for years, regardless of who's in charge. Congress is beholden to the issues of companies, not the needs of the citizenry. No matter which party we have, it gets worse each year. 

Meanwhile, our culture is degrading at an alarming rate. Music is nowhere near as classy as it once was, movies are becoming unwatchable by and large, and modern literature is often better used as firewood. No longer are virtues such as loyalty and love extolled by the media, no no. Now It's all about who can fuck more or make more money, and having an intellect makes you almost a target for ridicule. Furthermore, the gullibility of society is increasing, fundamental religions are gaining headway, even cults such as scientology are reporting increased membership.

Tell me, what hope is there for the species? Would I feel so depressed about this if I lived in Europe or something? Help!

Sorry if I rambled, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for your patience, if you made it through this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Scientology may be opening in my county. How can I (legally) stop this!? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Cult, I have heard, is considering opening a branch near where I live. (I cannot say exactly where, I want to avoid Fair Game after all.) I want a legal way to oppose them. I've considered writing members of the local government and detailing Fair Game, Snow White, Freakout, et al. and this seems to be my only real option.

 I've also heard that Scilons shut down personality tests if you flash a Guy Fawkes Mask (USEFUL!) and thankfully, masked protest is legal here. I feel as if I'm up against a corner here. I love my hometown, I don't want it to suffer under Scientology. I need all the help I can get in this matter. I don't care what people believe, but Scientology is, as an organisation, pure unadulterated evil. HELP, REDDIT!


EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your advice. This is all very helpful. Keep it coming, friends! If I am successful in this, I hope to organise. Perhaps I can make a page, telling people how to keep the cult from integrating into their hometowns. It is my hope that eventually, through efforts similar to mine, we can stop the spread of this cult. It's a lofty goal, but hey, it can't hurt to try right? Unless I get SP'd.

EDIT: Co$ was denied a building permit. This is a joyous time! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is this site so anti-US Military? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2009-08-26 01:05:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's just... the whole site seems to have a rather anti-US military stance. Has anyone ever considered what would happen if we hadn't bailed out the world in WWII? Or if we hadn't collapsed the Soviets? Or if we weren't cleaning up the terrorist filth? It's ugly work, and the methods are somewhat cruel, but the ends justify the means. Always.

As I await the inevitable shitstorm that is to follow my comparatively radical world view, I ask you to consider a world where the Nazis won WWII, where the Soviet Union never collapsed or perhaps a world where Islamic Fascism reigns supreme and everyone is subject to Shari'a law. Imagine a world without the US military and it's means and methods... It's not pleasant. You need us, world. More than you could possibly know.

Thank you for your time.  </TEXT>
