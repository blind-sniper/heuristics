<TEXT> I was outside of my garage one day and this dog walks in to say hi.  Looked very similar to Mr. Lady,  matted up like crazy, and she seemed really thirsty.  This dog looked like she had been homeless for months.

So I got her water, checked for tags, no tags.  Took her to the closest vet to check for a chip, she had one!  The owner lived 5 houses away from mine.  

I was happy to return her to her family.  When I got to their door, they didn't even know she had gotten out, and they weren't even that excited to see me with her.  It felt wrong leaving her with those people. 

I should've helped that dog.  OP, I just wanted to share that story, but I think you're doing a great job.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can be really hard to make these kind of people feel your pain.  If he has a victim complex, you just really have to know how to approach your conversation.  

It's hard to baby them, but I feel like you'll get through to him more if you make a point to recognize the little sacrifices he makes, then discuss your struggles.  I feel like that makes all of your strengths and sacrifices more measurable, he needs to really see *all* you do.  It does take the role of a really strong woman, your kids are lucky to have you.  

I feel your pain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow, I'm so sorry.  

Does he throw tantrums once in a while and text/say stupid stuff, or is his disdain for you just mounting and mounting?

I'm not too sure how your mom is, but if she is offering to help you more, I'd take it.  You really sound like you're reaching a breaking point, you need to let the ones that love you help you.

He definitely needs a kick in the ass and start contributing more to your family.  If he can make 3 kids, he can help raise your 2 kids.  It sounds like you're having to be the strongest person all the time, and I know that is tiring.  

Try to see things through his eyes.  It must feel like shit to not be able to provide for your family.  Maybe he's taking a little longer to feel really paternal and maybe he's resentful that he can't act youthful and free.  

I have no sympathy for him, but seeing through his eyes will at least help you communicate and hopefully resolve some of your issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I didn't either until I miscarried my first pregnancy.  It never entered my mind that after that happened, seeing pregnant women would make me have debilitating depression.  I didn't want to talk about babies, I shut out my friends that were pregnant or newly parents.  

I thought my severe depressing reaction would never end.  It lasted up until my successful pregnancy with my daughter.  I couldn't imagine the pain of losing twins that were carried and birthed.

But quoting the previous poster, 
Whenever I see a story like this, I would be lying if I said I felt no pain.

It's just really hard sometimes to share or feel joy for others.  And I wanted them to know I thought it was admirable to show kind words, knowing how hard it can be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eulogy for a dog
By George Vest

"Gentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.

A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death."

<TEXT> Interesting!  Something similar with me.  I go to Dunkin' by my house sometimes and always get a decaf iced coffee.  

But whenever I go to ANY other location, they tell me that Dunkin' in general doesn't make decaf iced coffee, that they'd have to specially pour hot decaf over ice.  So I say, yea that's ok.  But it always tastes like water and not like my neighborhood location.  

I'm convinced I always got full caffeine, but since I can't prove it, I didn't make a stink, I just stopped going :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not worried, I feel movement throughout the day.  Just wondering how similar our experiences are.  

She will stir a little in the a.m. when I wake up, then a little more when I drink or eat something.  Then it's very small subtle movements until I lay down at night.  The evening is usually when I feel some hiccups, then some stretching and kicking.  That's about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At your point in pregnancy, it's not impossible to feel baby, but since it is so small and it's just floating around in there, the odds of it being consistent and easy to physically trigger is rare.  It could be facing inward, which you wouldn't feel much.  But it is getting bigger, in the span of days, it will change the possibility of feeling baby.  

But drinking ice cold soda or juice works for me.  They say that they can feel temperature, and the sugar gets to them pretty quick.  So try that!  And the prodding lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are we talking about a certain baby in question? Or is this a hypothetical?

Because if a big-ass baby was born on January 15th, weighing 15 lbs+, with a calcified/deteriorated placenta, via cesarean this could be a 1 in 100,000 possibility that gestation time was 46 weeks.  But just know that it is not normal, or common, and doctors wouldn't let it go passed 42 weeks.  The chances of it being  stillborn are through the roof. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't possible at all, conception would have had to have been mid to late April. 

Edit:  Even the farthest stretch, saying implantation took the maximum amount of time, and baby went passed full term, that would still put you conceiving at the earliest, end of March/beginning  of April. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I told everyone that early, lol.  I would only maybe stipulate to them not to tell the world.  It is nice having a close support system if anything didn't go as planned, but it is beyond soul-crushing to relive pain every time you'd have to explain any not-so-good news.  Do what you feel is best :)

But I understand completely that it is hard to contain this news!

Edit: Forgot.  I told everyone before the pee was even dry on the test, so I didn't have a grand or interesting announcement.  But I do wish that I did!  It seems like fun to make it really special. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have seen the article.  What I got from it was that extensive use of ultrasound machine can slightly heat up body tissue and/or form air pockets.  

I have had 4 ultrasounds this pregnancy, two were from my Dr, 2 were elective at the boutique - type places.  I'm not a medical professional, but my logic is that if high-risk women get them quite frequently to monitor baby's health, the Dr wouldn't do anything to add harm to baby.  

I'm sure some people are excessive,  I wouldn't electively do one twice a week.  But my Dr says they are perfectly safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the same one the other poster has!  I loved it, but the same issue as her, it was bulky and no clothes could hide it, unless I had a huge sweatshirt or something loose or big on.  

Another thing was, it would stay in place perfectly as long as I was standing or walking, but every time I would get up from sitting down  I'd have to take part of it off and readjust. 

But oh man, if you've been having back pain, it helps so much.  Right when I put it on, it relieves pain, I have no idea how it works so great.  I tried putting it on before I read instructions,  and I was so wrong, lol, so be sure to put it on right and it will work for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's exactly what it sounds like.  Well, my car makes the noise when any door opens, I assumed it was connected to the keyless entry system.  It continues a similar amount of time whether the doors are closed soon after or not.  And sometimes it will randomly do it while I'm driving.  So It was really stumping me.

Man, that guy on youtube even explains how to fix it, I wonder if I should attempt that.  But thank you very much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> They look for measurements to determine any abnormalities.  I wish I would have known at the time exactly what they measure.  My tech wasn't too vocal, just kept saying everything looks good.  

I read online that they measure the femur, if it is shorter than its supposed to be, that could be a marker for downs.
They see if a nasal bone is present.
Check the lips, for cleft.
All limbs in general.
My tech looked at the heart a long time, not sure how much they can tell about it on a 2d ultrasound, but they really study the heart.

Those are just things that I wish she would have told me she was looking at so I could know what she was doing.  It was still very fun watching.  Good luck! </TEXT>

Let the ones you love help you through it and empathize, but don't be upset when other people aren't as gracious.  They aren't being malicious, although it might hurt.  You have to be strong,  it takes a lot of time to feel normal again.

<TEXT> If the amount of discharge I'm experiencing is normal.  It is odorless and doesn't have any other symptoms with it, but sometimes my underwear just feels so wet.  They say it will increase the further you get.

It's surprising how simple of a production that was and how many waves of emotions it made me go through.

<TEXT> What pissed me off was in the 3rd movie with the little girls,  some parts in the previews that made me want to see it were not in the movie!  I'm thinking of 2 particular scenes.

1. Little girl silently jumping off the second floor next to the stairs at night.

2. Little girl sitting next to mom at art easel,  explaining to mom that the ghost is right next to them and throws a can of water on the ghost to prove it.

But mostly about this movie, I was hoping to finally have closure about the house fire that they mention in movies 1, and 2.  But no, they open up a new can of worms with that weird cult, and nobody knows what's going on.  Unless I'm really missing something,  someone tell me.

<TEXT> You did say "I dont want a boy."  I'm not putting words in your mouth here.
Why someone would conceive a child knowing there would be a 50% chance of making something they don't want, blows my mind.  Why not adopt, so you know exactly what you're getting?

 I really enjoy hearing stories of good mom/son relationships. I really don't know... any. Out of the 25+ men I work with (programming, so that might be a factor) and my husband/BIL no one likes their mom. Most go out of their way to avoid their mom.

You only seem to recognize positive relationships with daughters, and negative with sons, that isn't the way it is, and it isn't healthy.

The things you're saying throughout this whole thread are not specific problems to men.  Men and *women* can be shitty human beings.  For every instance you give of a shitty son, I could give you one about daughters.    I especially don't sympathize with gender disappointment, when it's based on stereotypes.   </TEXT>

And I'm sorry but I find your post a little insensitive.  There are so many women out there who would die for the chance to have a baby, and you're disappointed by whether or not it will sit to use the toilet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, definitely switch now to prenatals,  but it's very good that you were intaking some of those vitamins! 

I don't know the list of vitamins off hand that is required for an expectant mother, but it's not all about what you're missing.  As a pregnant women, there is also a list of vitamins that we *shouldn't* consume, and others that we shouldn't consume in high quantities.  So that is just as important to monitor,  as what you *should* be taking.  

That's why prenatals, across the board, are safe and amazing.  Everyone has their own opinion on which brand is the best, but I just go by the highest concentration of the most important ingredients. </TEXT>

But prenatal vitamins are so important right now, it's so early in the game that the higher amount of folic acid and dha you intake the less likely for baby to have abnormalities!   </TEXT>

That means he would have to be on the Pacino level of acting for me to be convinced he was just *acting* like an asshole.  And I'm not convinced. 

I could possibly see him in the future and change my opinion of him, but based on this show, he's not my favorite. 

Edit: Actually,  based on this show *and* the fact he went to jail for hitting that girlfriend, is why he's not my favorite.

<TEXT> 2 quick questions. 

My house-broken shorkie still occasionally likes to urinate on the corners or furniture,  why does he pee in the correct place 90% of the time, and not the rest, any way to fix that?

He also gets crazy separation anxiety and cries if I even close a door in the house for 10 seconds, he always wants to be with us and follows us, any advice there?

He also doesn't own his mansion, something that I didn't look into further yet.  But it belongs to Covenant Trust, no idea, but that could possibly be a way of avoiding taxes.   </TEXT>

[This place isn't exactly a humble place of worship](http://www.imgur.com/Xo6Dmtp.jpeg). Looks like it takes quite a bit of money to produce this setup... and those single-serve communion cups.

Get in and sit down, the first 35 min is a small, young, rock band singing faith songs.  Everyone with hands in the air, really pretending to feel this lame music.

Then we finally have someone preaching.  But he never opens a bible or tells us to open ours.  He just starts telling us anecdotal stories and his own interpretations of stories from the bible.  

When the collection plate passed me,  I noticed it was all checks, no one gives paper money anymore, let alone change.  

Towards the end, the preacher kept reminding us repeatedly to join some workshops next month, not free of course.  No thanks.


I just remember church when I was a child as being humble.  All we ever did was read from the bible and sing together.  No one had to hand over their paychecks.

Now it has just turned into this business,  that is so disgusting I couldn't stand being there.  I've been an atheist for the majority of my life now, but seeing that first hand just blew my asshole off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You said it.  A lifetime of worry.  Even after you get into second tri, you're going to be anxious til birth.  Then you'll be anxious til it's out of the possible SIDS age.

Miscarriage is a terrible, heartbreaking tragedy, but know that if it were to happen, it was because something was wrong and it needed to.  

I've had one previous miscarriage at 8.5 weeks.  Not sure of the cause.  This year, my Dr put me on progesterone until I was 10 weeks.  Now I'm 14 weetks.  Trying to be positive and patient.  

The one thing I could suggest is that you get a doppler.  I know you run the risk of more worry if you couldn't find it.  But I got one and was able to find the heartbeat at 10 weeks, and every day since.  Just an idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminds me of my favorite (long) quote from Patton Oswalt.

"I remember, when 9/11 went down, my reaction was, "Well, I've had it with humanity."

But I was wrong. I don't know what's going to be revealed to be behind all of this mayhem. One human insect or a poisonous mass of broken sociopaths.

But here's what I DO know. If it's one person or a HUNDRED people, that number is not even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the population on this planet. You watch the videos of the carnage and there are people running TOWARDS the destruction to help out. (Thanks FAKE Gallery founder and owner Paul Kozlowski for pointing this out to me). This is a giant planet and we're lucky to live on it but there are prices and penalties incurred for the daily miracle of existence. One of them is, every once in awhile, the wiring of a tiny sliver of the species gets snarled and they're pointed towards darkness.

But the vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evil doers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak. This is beyond religion or creed or nation. We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil. We'd have eaten ourselves alive long ago.

So when you spot violence, or bigotry, or intolerance or fear or just garden-variety misogyny, hatred or ignorance, just look it in the eye and think, "The good outnumber you, and we always will." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my experience with miscarriages, ::warning, not a happy discussion:: it always takes a while for my body to start to get rid of the baby.  First I felt a complete loss of symptoms,  then it took anywhere from 3-5 weeks for me to have bleeding and painful cramps.  

So I'd personally say it looks good for you if you still have frequent urination among *any* other symptoms.  That means the hcg is still present.  Have you seen or heard a heartbeat yet?  What other symptoms do you feel? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 8w3d.  I've had a previous Mc, so this time my Dr put me on progesterone pills from week 7 to week 12.  These pills have made my pregnancy symptoms so strong that I'm afraid I won't be able to tell if I Mc and have a loss of symptoms.  I've had very strong nausea for a couple weeks now, but idk if it's from the pills or my pregnancy.  When I miscarried last time I didn't have cramps or bleeding for weeks after the baby died, but the loss of symptoms happened very quickly.  My first appointment is August 11, all they've done for me so far was draw blood and write me a prescription.  I'm just scared and needed to vent.  Thanks for listening. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Products and treatments might make it feel a little better, but there's no way to just *rebuild* hair.  

That amount of damage has to be from something you're doing. .. Flat iron?  Color?  Constant swimming in chlorine?  

Whatever it is, find the root of the problem, stop doing it and just gradually grow and trim it until it feels amazing again.  It will take a while, but if you want to keep your hair a decent length you'll have to be patient.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if I agree with this.  I charge $150 for roots, partial, cut, blowout.  If I wanted to help a friend, even if I went to their house, I would never expect $150.  

It's really nice to receive the same, but if you're going to call it a friendly favor, where does that part come out.  The comfort of their house doesn't even do anything for me, I'd much rather have a comfortable shampoo bowl and salon chair so I'm not making them uncomfortable or breaking my back.

When I do hair for people at their house, it's something nice I like to do if they have kids and can't make it in, or if they are unable to drive.

But when it comes to maybe cutting them a break on the price, I would definitely have them come to me, so on top of me taking some off their bill, I'm not wasting my own gas to do it.  

I think a fair amount to pay would be 60-80% of what they would normally charge.  If he didn't tell you a price he probably wouldn't even expect that much, and he'd be thrilled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Religions are also no longer needed in todays society, if you need a book wrote thousands of years ago that contradicts itself hundreds of times and has had it's fundamentals proved wrong to live a good life then you have moral issues.

<TEXT> I completely agree with how you describe your view.  Perfect.  

It's important to me because I feel like humanity has a lot of living to do.  I feel as if people are too busy worrying about how they will spend their afterlife than to really enjoy this life.  

It comes down to... NONE of us know what will happen after we die.  Nobody.   No one has that knowledge.  And instead of worrying about it, we should just live.  

I guess my viewpoint isn't geared towards fence-riders, more towards fundamentalists.  The people that waste their lives, or harm others, or stand in the way of other people's rights.

"Before the passing of the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986 by the New Zealand Parliament, the Salvation Army was active throughout New Zealand gathering signatures for a petition seeking to prevent the bill's passing."  

They lobby against equal rights.

<TEXT> You know people are born gay and don't have a choice, great.  

The fact that they can't control their orientation is something that hasn't been known for a long time.  When all we had thousands of years ago were lines like this to refer to, 

"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."-Lev.20:13 

...people were well convinced it was a choice.

But thats humankind for you, learning evolving, continuing to gain information. You are helping me make my point.  

*This book has gotten things wrong.* 

I know what you might say, "of course a book written so long ago wouldn't have all the answers..." "it must be interpreted correctly to understand it's significance/meaning..."  but it got equality wrong, a human right that people are still fighting for!  People shouldn't be able to  blame it on the interpretation or time it was written.  Not acceptable to me, considering how many people live their life hanging by every word of that book.

<TEXT> You are an example of what I'm talking about, no offense.  If you literally interpret it, it does say the earth is that old.

"Young Earth creationism (YEC) is the religious belief that the Universe, Earth and all life on Earth were created by direct acts of the Abrahamic God during a relatively short period, sometime between 5,700 and 10,000 years ago. Its primary adherents are those Christians and Jews who, using a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a basis, believe that God created the Earth in six 24-hour days."

Edit:  Like you said, you can easily say that a literal interpretation of Genesis is ludicrous because the age of the earth has evidence that it is billions of years old.    

But is that how everything will go in the bible once we find enough evidence against it?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some people?  I am talking about the people who have nothing more than common knowledge on the subject.   Every religious person that has crossed my path, had their own way of interpreting things in the bible.  

The ones that think the earth is 6,000 years old, take Genesis literally.  The Christians that believe what the scientists say to be accurate, say it's up for interpreting and that science fits with the bible.  Of course there are people that say science fits with the bible, because there's an overwhelming amout of evidence to support the age of our planet and they'd be crazy not to agree.

The same with homosexuality.  It's a sin.  Gay people are a large group, that are shunned by numerous religious organizations.  But then other groups say God loves everyone and excepts everyone.  

It seems to conveniently come down to whether or not an individual is personally accepting or not of the lifestyle but they just blame it on the interpretation of their bible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just always wonder how people decide what to take literally, or figuratively in the bible.

Whether it be how old the earth is said to be, or the view on homosexuality.  Everything..

People will say that the earth isn't *literally* 6,000 years old, and that you shouldn't interpret Genesis as literal.  

Who are they to interpret it the way they feel it should be?   Not only that, but interpret the whole thing the same way or don't.  The picking and choosing is all over the place. </TEXT>

It's absolutely safe if it gets on your skin, but if the color is darker it could stain your skin.  That's the only thing you'd wanna worry about, is staining.  So avoid the skin as much as possible.  Just lightly paint it on with a q-tip and let it process for the time specified.  </TEXT>

If you *choose* to be on the strip, we have world-class restaurants and hotels;  and don't forget, debauchery of your choosing.

I don't understand all the hate, if I go to North Town off of Fremont, I could find drug addicts.  They are there, they are in lots of cities.  But it's your opinion to hate our region.  For every bad area of the city, there are good. </TEXT>

Edit:  If it's something you really desire, you should go for it.  There are some cons.  Short haircuts are a lot more maintenance and upkeep and the picture you chose is an intermediate style to achieve on your own.  It might look easy, but it is a little harder than it looks.  It's not impossible though, you should just be prepared. </TEXT>

I had one at 8w5d just for fun and it measured fine with a good heartbeat.  But now I'm feeling very sad.  It did look very small, but she didn't try to move around or find a heartbeat.  I'm trying to be realistic and not overly optimistic,  but we will see.


Edit:  Nightmare confirmed, will be scheduling a D C tomorrow, hope to see all you guys in the future sometime.  :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a lot more complicated than you would think.


First off, if you have any artificial hair color already on your hair, a lighter color will not do anything. Hair color is a lot more gentle than bleach, so it won't break through artificial hair dye to lighten it.

Sometimes when you dilute hair color, it inhibits it from depositing a nice tone and you may be left with more of an unwanted warmer tone.  

There are factors that need to be considered,  just be sure to talk to a professional in great detail before you waste your time. </TEXT>

Meanwhile there's small fundamentalist religious groups that marry 12 year old girls with old men, and you're here complaining about this guy.  Is this a joke? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not arguing here I just think you need to calm down.  This is one man's incidence with being touched as a child, and his feelings towards it.


This was his explanation:

"Should I have lied and said it was the worst thing that ever happened to me? Should I have mendaciously sought the sympathy due to a victim who had truly been damaged for the rest of his life? Should I have named the offending teacher and called down posthumous disgrace upon his head?


No, no and no. To have done so would have been to belittle and insult those many people whose lives really were blighted and cursed, perhaps by year-upon-year of abuse by a father or other person who was deeply important in their life. To have done so would have invited the justifiably indignant response: How dare you make a fuss about the mere half minute of gagging unpleasantness that happened to you only once, and where the perpetrator was not your own father but a teacher who meant nothing special to you in your life. Stop playing the victim. Stop trying to upstage those who really were tragic victims in their own situations. Dont cry wolf about your own bad experience, because it undermines those whose experience was  and remains  so much worse."

<TEXT> Eulogy for a Dog, by George Vest


	Gentlemen of the jury: 

The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. 

His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. 

Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. 

The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. 

A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. 

The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. 

The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.


Gentlemen of the jury:

A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. 

He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. 

He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. 

He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. 

When all other friends desert, he remains. 

When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As /u/torchytodd said, Vanish is your best bet.  Some color removing systems contain bleach, you have to be careful what you buy.

Even with color removers, you can't expect the best case scenario, the results *can* be minimal depending on how much color has been deposited on your hair in the past.  But at least they are safe and you can do them multiple times. </TEXT>

That is a blended haircut, and your pics are not.  See how the sides graduate into the top length?  In your pictures, the top is disconnected.

Please tell me you notice the difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like a 1 1/2.

I think an important detail is that in the pictures you're showing, the sides aren't blended to the top,  there's a very clean disconnect.  

You have to show the stylist those pictures and tell them you want it disconnected like the pictures.  If someone were to walk in and tell me they wanted a 1 1/2 on the sides, it would be my natural reaction to blend it, which creates a very different look from these pictures. </TEXT>
