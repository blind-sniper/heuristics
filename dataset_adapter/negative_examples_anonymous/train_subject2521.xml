<TEXT> Part of the problem here is that it sounds like you're attempting to gain muscle and lean out at the same time. While this isn't impossible, it can certainly be tricky.

I would recommend bulking and then cutting. That is, if you still feel the need to gain more muscle mass. If you're already satisfied with your muscle mass, bump up the cardio and limit your lifting to focus more on toning rather than growth. 

 is it more likely that I am just shit at counting calories?

Calorie consumption sounds okay, 1800-2100 is a good ballpark (don't know your stats). However the fact that you even have to ask yourself this question probably means you could be doing better at keeping track. Perhaps you already answered your own question!

Good Luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ended football right before my senior season in high school. Had to help with bills anyways and work full time since my mom was out of work. The high school I went to practically breeds D1 recruits. When I think back, sure I would have loved to continue on and play in college, and it HURT LIKE HELL to have to give it up.

However, before I even graduated that year I already had a foot through the door in the finance industry, started expanding on my hobbies, and even leaned out and got signed with a top modeling agency.

All in all, the class before mine graduated 8 D1 recruits and things hardly worked out for any of them. I on the other hand had a great resume, academic scholarships, and multiple income sources. It was one of those changes that took some time to respect and truly appreciate. Never thought that dropping one major passion of mine would lead to me becoming a much happier and well-rounded individual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me and a friend got fucked up after dipping our blunt in liquid codeine and decided to try finding a genre porn that doesn't exist. We searched everything. For example, here were some of our discoveries.

The following exist:
-Almost any childhood cartoon you can think of has a porn spinoff
-Amputee porn
-Puke porn
-Poop porn (disturbingly common)
-Actual Donkey punching

However we did not find anything in the area of mental disability porn... so yeah, i suppose the only way to win that game was to end up on something that doesn't exist because it's a shameful thought in the first place.

Amputee porn made my dick twitch </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a Sony A6000 and I've also had a few Canons and Nikons. I LOVE my Sony. The af and shutterspeed are amazing perks to their line. The only gripe I have is the digital viewfinder. But being that it IS mirrorless, what else would I expect? Don't get me wrong, they do a great job with it, however it can be a bit frustrating. 

The lag isn't bad at all, but definitely noticeable when shooting a moving object. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can anybody here refer me to the best bargain for Canvas Prints?

I want to start putting some of my work on display, and although I don't expect large 3 panel split canvases to be cheap, I am still looking for the best bang for my buck.

Cheapest place I have found so far is Costco, plus they conveniently let me upload my photos and I can preview each concept.

Any/all information is appreciated! </TEXT>
