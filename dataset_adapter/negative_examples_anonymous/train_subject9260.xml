<TEXT> I don't think Uber is perfect, but has there been no instances of cab drivers [murdering](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/479549/Detectives-uncover-SECRET-LAIR-serial-killer-taxi-driver), [attacking](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-hunt-cabbie-allegedly-sexually-assault-mom-queens-article-1.1918409), [raping](http://kdvr.com/2015/03/16/woman-claims-cab-driver-raped-robbed-her-da-charges-driver-with-5-felonies/), or [stealing](http://abc7chicago.com/news/cab-driver-charged-with-identity-theft-/395897/) from riders?

They do have background checks, which might need to be revamped. They require insurance for their drivers, they just don't pay it themselves. And if you get caught doing anything like you mentioned, they take you off the system. Basically, you're fired... and arrested. If that isn't accountability...

Maybe they need to be inspected like Yellow Cabs are. Maybe they need to revamp their system on hiring. I don't know, but don't tell me that they are less safe than cabs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These kind of people would never have let her bring a gun on the set.

First, the recruiter would cut off contact if the prospect seemed too confident or willful.

Second, they ingratiate themselves with the prospect, lulling them into a false sense of security.

Third, they fly you out there and pick you up from the airport for a short trip, telling you that you don't need a lot of extra clothes. This way, they know you aren't carrying a weapon on the flight, and they have control of your luggage after it.

Finally, they will probably have you leave your purse in the hotel, claiming that they don't wish it to be stolen, leaving you with no personal belongings at all, and no money when the inevitable realization occurs that they aren't having you model, they are filming you being raped.

Most employers are willing to give maternity over adopting a human child, but adopting a puppy? Get the adoption done on Friday afternoon, and you have all weekend to bond with the animal.

But, I almost want to see a case like this go to trial, just so a judge can tell these damned "pet parents" that their "baby" is not the same as a baby. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To put it most simply, Marvel uses a Multiverse, where any character can technically cross over into another (Japanese Spider-Man and his giant robot, Leopardon, in the comic series Spider-Men).

DC uses an Omniverse. The Comics, Animated Series, Movies, Series and the new CW shows each have their own Multiverse, where the other groups don't even exist. Dean Cain Superman will never show up with Smallville's Lana. But within those multiverses, there are dimensional rifts, pocket universes, and split timelines that can be crossed into, like in Crisis events. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that is just the image they used for the fact. 

George was recast for Parts II   III, with the new actor in makeup and using camera tricks to fool the audience into believing that Crispin was involved in the movie.

Technically, they would have been okay with the newspaper clipping alone, as long as they paid the "stock footage" fee to Crispin.

But creating a lookalike, as opposed to simply finding a new actor with visual similarity, created a false impression of the acceptance of the original actor.

The irony of all this is that Crispin left the show because he wanted more money, but he was originally angry at the idea that George's success meant that he was wealthy now. </TEXT>

But, you are wrong on one thing. Final Fantasy XIV is a game. You play the game how *you* want to play, not how others want you to play.

The "there is a right way to play, and every other way is wrong" mentality was part of what poisons a community. Not everyone who plays a job is going to be worried about "mathematical optimability". 

If you don't think I use Fire *enough*, then maybe it's just that you have a stick in your ass, but I'll grant you that if I don't use Fire *at all*, then I may be hindering a party too much.

But it is when people act in an unexpected manner that they can become surprising. </TEXT>

There is a difference between Batman and Spider-Man.

Yes, both watched their loved one die at the hands of a criminal and that caused them to become a costumed crime-fighter.

But Batman was a boy, watched his parents (wealthy philanthropists) die during a robbery after leaving a play or movie. Spider-Man was a mostly grown boy (teen to young adult depending on the writer), already with superpowers, whose uncle (not particularly wealthy at all) was shot by a criminal that he had the power to stop.

While it has a similarity, it is not the same origin story. </TEXT>

If you happen to be standing right at a wall with a conveniently placed  ladder, then yeah... go ahead and climb over. But in a real world scenario, you will be meeting the wall in the middle of your run.

The average person will do as I suggested, and head for the clearest gap in the wall, like a gate. A parkour expert *should* consider how high the wall is and whether it is easier to go to the gate or not.

Up to the 43 yard line, 7 yards away from the wall, it is still more efficient to run to the gate than it is to climb over it. </TEXT>

That is my understanding of the matter. I'm not saying they are wrong to do it, especially if it isn't hurting anyone, but it isn't efficient. </TEXT>

Here is a breakdown of the wall example to show how simply running for the gate is more efficient than trying to climb over the fence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, conserving the comparison, if it is a 10 yard run to the gap in the wall, it would be a 5 yard tall wall... 15 feet.

If I were going for peak efficiency of running toward such a wall, I would head directly for the gate, instead of hitting the wall directly and climbing over.

As for the spacial efficiency, if you are running a total distance of 100 yards with that fence at the 50 yard line, and the gate 10 yards away from your path...

The direct, line of sight path climbing over the wall is a total of 110 yards.

Running to the gate and through the fence is 101.98 yards. </TEXT>

It's the same reason car dealerships constantly send out junk ads. Because they *know* someone will get it that needs a car. If they didn't advertise, they would have gotten less prospective buyers.

That's what the stupid "like this to have God cure Timmy's nut cancer" posts do is hopefully get some people to donate money for cancer treatment. </TEXT>

He hacked into a website and obtained names, addresses, and phone numbers of women who had an abortion, and was releasing those details publically.

Imagine if you were a rape victim, and you abort the product of that rape only to be hounded by anti-abortion picketers who call for you, a victim, to be assaulted or executed because you couldn't stand to keep the child.

You will expend more energy climbing over or vaulting the wall as opposed to running around it. Obviously, it's still more worth it to hop over a 2 foot fence, but climbing onto a 40 or 80 foot building? Just go around.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They know two things.

First, that Priceline and other third party reservation systems take out a huge commission on the rooms, so you ask for $150, he gets it for $125, but the hotel only receives  $100. If you match the rate he was offered, you'll gain $25...

The other thing they know is that these sites are notorious for screwing up reservations.

So, they offer to book directly if you match the rate, and supposedly everyone wins.

As for asking if you have rooms available, they just want you to confirm that there is a room, and that the price they are seeing is better than what was offered. If you and the TPS are the same price, he'll just book with you directly since there is no price matching involved. </TEXT>

So T0 (premovie) Skynet is independently developed, identifies the resistance leader, sends a T-800 back in time.

T1 Skynet (Skynet as a result of the events of Terminator 1) sees that a Terminator was already sent and that it was used to help build itself, and sends a T-800 back to the original point to ensure its existence, then sends a T-1000 to try and kill John. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a lawyer, but I like stepping in.

Parents are charged with the upbringing of their children. Making sure they are safe, don't leave the house at night, that they go to school, etc.

Because of this certain rights normally afforded to persons are less available.

Children have the right to free speech, without much interference from the government, but certain speech (like standing on your desk and cussing out the teacher) is disruptive to other students. As such, you may be punished for such behavior.

But parents have the right to punish for practically any behavior, as long as that punishment is not abusive. If you don't want your child to say the word "moist", you can tell them no dessert when they say it. You can also refuse to let them wear certain brands of clothing, certain styles, or makeup,  as it is up to you to raise them properly.

You should probably sit down with your child at some point to calmly explain why you don't want them to wear a Marilyn Manson shirt, though.

As for privacy, they have certain reasonable expectations of privacy, such as not being watched while they shower or not putting sensors on their bed to see if they have a lover with them or other creepy stuff. But you have to be able to do things like see if they are hiding pornography or drugs, and many parents do things like laundry and cleaning, so going through his underwear drawer every once in a while is allowable. Promise him that you will treat him more like an adult and limit such searches to when you have a reason to think something is wrong.

Tell him that you can't allow him to lock the door with anything more than a privacy lock (like they have on bathrooms, where you can unlock it with a coin or something), just in case you need to help him, and promise that you won't barge in needlessly.

You son will want more and more privacy from you, especially as he matures into sexuality, and it is your job to make sure he understands that you will give it to him within reason.

<TEXT> I'll be honest. I've never actually seen how much the tanks of CO2 and the bags of syrup cost.

I wasn't privy to operating costs at the restaurant, and the hotel I work now (where I do see a lot of these expenses) doesn't order fountain sodas.

Http://Pdco.com/node/88289 uses a $50 estimate for a 5 gallon Bag in a Box, but they forget to include the carbonation.

Their estimate is that a 5 gal BiB will yield ~3780 oz, at a total cost of 1.32 cents per oz. A 20 Oz soda, with ice costs about 12 cents, plus the cost of washing said cup, if at a dine-in, or the cost of a throwaway cup in fast food. Their final estimate, without refills, is 22 cents.

*But*, when people fill their own drinks, they are more likely to put less ice and more product, increasing that estimate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people.

I think this is the problem many people have.

Hardcore feminists look at anything spoken by a Men's Rights Activist as bullying to women, including calls for true equality.

Similarly, MRAs find it to be bullying behavior for Feminists to call for men to constantly "check their privilege"

Ultimately it becomes a pissing contest over who is the bigger bully, resulting in a lopsided ruling on one group being okay and the other group being banned.

Take the fat people hate sub. If you are offended by people making fun of fat people, then why are you looking through /r/fatpeoplehate? (For the record, I'm a chunky guy, and don't approve of the sub, but damn it... it should be allowed to be there as long as they don't break the law)

I get that Reddit is not a strictly American community, but we have a saying here. "I may not like what you have to say, but I will *die* to protect your right to say it."

So, my question is this. Can you not make it so "hateful" subreddits are not visible on /r/all or /r/random, and limit the bans solely to material that is against the law?   </TEXT>

They haven't bought the Samsung yet, so they don't know if there are games. Most mobile game commercials hype the iOS version, with a growing number stating it is on Google Play.

If this is his/her first smartphone, then it is reasonable enough to ask. And the appropriate answer is "yes". Not "let me laugh at you".

Idiot Guy: Can I get a room for Today and Friday?

Me: I'm sorry, but we don't have a room available for tonight.

Idiot: Okay, what about just tomorrow?

Me: $149.95 for tomorrow...

Idiot: Are you sure I can't pay a little extra and get the room today?

Me: No, you can't. We don't have rooms today.

Idiot: Okay, I'll get it for tomorrow, what do I need?

Me: Okay, can I get your name?

Idiot: Idiot...

Me: Last Name?

Idiot: Idiot...

Me: Your whole name, please?

Idiot: Idiot Guy, sorry.

Me: That's okay. What is your address?

Idiot: (rattles off fast) 1234 San Antonio 78230

Me: I'm sorry, what was the street address?

Idiot: 1234... that's my apartment number.

Me: I need your whole street address, please.

Idiot: NW Military 1234.

Me: (you can probably see the vein in my head) What is the street number?

Idiot: Oh, I don't know. It's "Some Apartment Complex I've Never Heard Of"... here let me give you the address on my ID. (Gives an address that I can actually send mail if I need to.)

Me: Okay, and what kind of credit card can I use to guarantee the room?

Idiot: I'm just going to pay when I come in.

Me: No, we need a credit card.

Idiot: Okay, can I use my friend's card for that, I'm just going to pay cash.

Me: That's fine, but we will be authorizing that card in the morning before your arrival.

Idiot: (pause) I'll call you back with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The spirit of Super Sentai is what makes them a sentai.

The thing that causes me pause is whether the Extra Heroes, like Mele, Rio, and Hyuuga, are "sentai" or not. The wiki lists these persons as sentai-like heroes that are similar to Rangers, but aren't.

But, at the same time, they *do* have Ranger Keys, or are otherwise tied to Sentai Grand Powers.

The one thing that they share with Jin and Juicy is the fact that they are mostly either alien or mechanical. Jin being an extra-dimensional Avatar and Juicy being a robot indicates that they *might* be Extra Heroes, and not Rangers.

However, they call themselves Rangers, so maybe that's enough?

It's maddening. Maybe it's just a thread that shouldn't be tugged on too hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jury Nullification is a very necessary part of our system.

But for conviction, you need a unanimous verdict. For acquittal, you don't. While the prosecution can retry the case, they won't do that if they think the same result is likely.

And because of the way Nullification works, judges and prosecutors generally won't ask you about it during voir dire, as it can inject the idea in your mind.

If you have a convincing reason as to why you should be let off, and the crime was light enough, *and* you convinced a jury member already, then they aren't likely to continue pursuing the case. 

Obviously, if you can convince the entire jury, you're just out Scott free. </TEXT>

I want one so I can effectively slap a big screen TV on the wall without the problems associated with buying and installing a big screen TV.

And both systems can do big screen equivalents. The difference being that with HoloLens, I can see when my roommate walks into the room.

HoloLens will be able to do VR with a single, simple upgrade... a black visor to blot out surroundings. Oculus would require some doing to get AR, but it isn't impossible.

I'm not saying that these are identical products. But one is [this kind of toaster]( http://www.kirbysupply.com/Images/APW_Wyott/AT_Express.jpg) and the other is [this kind of toaster](http://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6636079/6636079/Black-Decker-Stainless-Steel-Six-slice-Toaster-Oven-P14200190.jpg)

You could technically get away with murder if you can convince 1 juror that you were justified, or simply that you're too good looking to go to jail.

For a case like this, it is very easy to convince at least 1 older person, who knows or knew someone with a dibilitating illness, that what you did shouldn't be a crime. </TEXT>

But there is no disease that I've ever heard of where only 10 people in the entire world have it.

Giving a more realistic "low-ball" number of 100,000 people (we are including people in the future that might need it), that means each dose would be worth about $100 in R D.

Do individuals, like Space Sheriff Gavan and Kamen Rider Black share the same connection to the spirit of Super Sentai? Is it something inherent to the group dynamic, or is it the desire to protect others?

It's not a simple question to ask, let alone answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But there were other instances of Extra Heroes that were not considered Sentai that fought with the teams. 

Ninjaman, BullBlack Hyuuga, Signalman, and others were undoubtedly part of the team, but were not classified as members. Some were human (Hyuuga), some were monsters (Rio and Mele), and some were robots or golems (Ninjaman).

The confusion comes from the fact that there isn't much difference between the main members of a team and an Extra Hero.

Reading further into it, it is possible that the power to transform is something that can be claimed by anyone, but that it is a connection to the planet that makes them Sentai (at which point even the Extra Heroes would count) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's just a thought I had regarding the characters. Beet Buster (Jin) is an Avatar projected by a Buddyroid (Beet J Stag). Because of this, his transformation sequence is linked directly to Stag Buster's and he can not transform outside of his presence.

So, is there even a need, outside of aesthetics, to transform? Does the power of a Sentai come from some mystical planetary force (as shown in Gokaiger), from the power of the human spirit,  or is it something that just can be created, taken, or duplicated at will (as Enter seemed to be able to do)? </TEXT>

The bolt of lightning from 1955 to send Marty back to the future had to be funneled directly into the FC for the time travel to go off.

My thought is that the time circuits set a direction and power for the flux capacitor to discharge, giving the appropriate amount of power into the quantum drive (they never explain what exactly allows the car to travel through time) and allowing it to pinpoint it's arrival time to the second. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From [the abstract on this study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00629.x/abstract)... "Gender and Ethnicity Differences in Freshmen Engineering Student Attitudes: A Cross-Institutional Study"

 Definite gender differences were found on the pre-survey for five of the attitude measures. For all but one of these measures, female engineering students' initial attitudes were more negative than those of male students. Across the sample of institutions, female students consistently began their engineering studies with a lower confidence in background knowledge about engineering, their abilities to succeed in engineering, and their perceptions of how engineers contribute to society than did their male counterparts. However, those same female students were more comfortable with their study habits than were the male students. The post questionnaire data indicated that differences for three of these five attitude measures persisted. Most important, female engineering students continued to maintain a lower confidence in their abilities to succeed in engineering as compared to male engineering students. When the PFEAS data were mapped into EC 2000 outcomes, comparable cross-institutional gender differences were observed that paralleled those found for the attitudinal measures.

The study in question showed girls lacked confidence in their knowledge of the subject compared to boys, but (not paradoxically) were more confident in their study habits. My (admittedly layman) assessment is that girls compensate for perceived weakness in a subject by studying harder, which naturally boosts their final performance. </TEXT>

Some are only better in certain situations (addition of strings of larger or more complex numbers, like your example, is one where that isn't bad thing).

BTTF - Marty goes back in time, changes history so his mom and dad don't hook up and almost immediately starts to disappear  (starting with his brother in the picture).

BTTF2 - Old Biff goes back in time, gives himself the Almanac, somehow makes it back to the original 2015 before he disappears from the timeline.

The problem is, the very act of going back in time and giving himself the almanac should have created the universe-destroying paradox that Doc was worried about. Because if Old Biff never existed, he never could have brought the Almanac back to 1955. </TEXT>

On that matter, the whole "can't see through lead" part is just silly. He's been shown seeing through dozens of heavy concrete walls, halfway across the country, meaning he is not actually using x-rays for his xray vision, but lead just happens to have the right configuration of atoms to stop it?

A good theory would be something along the lines of "Willy Wonka puts acid in his chocolate" that uses evidence like the trippy, weird interactions that the people encounter in the factory (which they don't normally feel because the effects are lessened greatly after the chocolate is cooked, formed, and shipped). Or maybe that Oz is another dimension of Earth, and that explains why the Wizard looks exactly like the kindly carney that Dorothy met before going there.

<TEXT> Where is the evidence?

There is zero evidence outside of the story that you made up.

Beyond the timeframe and setting of the "real world" (Depression Era America), and the idea of little people who make candy, there is nothing to indicate the Wonka stepped foot in Oz.

More damning to your theory is the idea that the Red Brick Road, seen in Oz, somehow leads past the Deadly Desert to a place in America... because the Chocolate Factory is clearly not in Oz, due to the large number of people that gathered for the Golden Ticket event.

But there is no evidence that Wonka's father was the Wizard of Oz, nor that the Wonkavator was an Oz construct of any kind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Specifically, making lifestyle changes will affect the people who are around you. If you hang around with weaker, less fit people, you are more likely to encounter weaker genetics (people who are genetically predisposed to health problems and obesity, for example). If you hang around at the gym more, you are more likely to encounter healthier genetics (people with higher metabolisms and less propensity to health issues), resulting in stronger offspring.

If you raise your children to have the same habits, they will similarly meet stronger, healthier individuals on average, further strengthening your line. In that way, even if you hit the genetic short straw (and marry a woman who used to be 500 pounds and worked her ass off to fit into a size 3 dress), your children are more likely to make a healthy genetic match. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of the time, they don't project themselves with a wholesome, family image. Tom Cruise doesn't play a loving and successful husband and father who takes time for his children and never so much as goes away on a business trip for the weekend. Samuel L Jackson doesn't portray himself as a kindly man who doesn't cuss and would rather give you a stern talking to instead of a spanking.

If this was Eddie Murphy that was accused, we probably wouldn't bat an eye about watching Beverly Hills Cop.

But if Dave Collier were to have this level of accusations, maybe they'd stop showing Full House for a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always "loved" his pronunciation of "cubby".

But the biggest shortcuts I can recommend are to make multiple reservations one at a time (select the first reservation and "insert" and it will copy name, address, phone, email, notes, and credit card, leaving you to enter the checkin/checkout dates), and have tech support's number on speed dial.

The system slows down like nothing else, as it searches through *every hotel's entire history* to pull up any information. Sunday mornings are the absolute worst, as every active hotel is checking out a total of millions of guests.

If you have access to manager's tools, you can cut off reservation lines or change rates, but you'll still want to mostly get direction from the boss on doing it, and you can reset passwords for your coworkers.

One hidden function of SoftHotel is the ability to change room types for an uneditable reservation (SOE, SOO, and other third party reservations that shouldn't be modified normally). Go into the Room View screen (F2), and click the button right next to the room number field. Select the new room type and assign a room, and it will force the system to accept the change.  </TEXT>

20 years ago were were talking about global floods happening today. But can anyone clearly state how much of the increases are directly caused by mankind, and how much of the increases are natural? Can anyone give an accurate prediction of 20-40 years from now?  I'm not convinced they can.

 But really, I'm not even against most of the stuff on the global warming movement.

Solar energy, wind and water energy, nuclear and geothermal energy... electric cars, ion propulsion, space-based shipyards... the whole gamut of science fiction is within grasp to become science fact, and we can't be bothered with arguments over *why we want them to come about*. </TEXT>

I ask an honest question (how can they tell the difference between the enexorable change in the climate caused by natural forces and the preventable change in climate caused by man's activity, especially when both are occurring at the same time?), and get accused of being an idiot or a liar.

You aren't winning any popularity contests by acting this way, and frankly it's the best way to take someone who is open minded enough to listen and close them to you.

Just some food for thought.

But when you accuse a layman, a hotel front desk clerk, of being bought and paid for by a shadowy anti-environmental conspiracy, I hope you aren't linking to any sort of group that makes money on the climate movement. (I'll check the link out later.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm still confused as to how they can tell the difference between anthropogenic and natural climate change.

The Earth goes through cycles of warming and cooling, resulting in the growth and recession of glaciers. Geologically, we are in a warming period that will end with deglaciation, and rising sea levels, regardless of mankind's effect on the environment.

This means we can delay such effects, at best, and not stop them. And we could even do more harm to the planet by trying to stop the natural order. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You said yourself that you had $5,000 cash when you graduated.

When I graduated, I had nothing. I signed up for the Air Force, but ultimately I didn't qualify. Being in boot camp only part of the way screwed me up more than you'd believe.

These 9 years of working a shitty, low paying job are probably the best thing for my resume, since I can now claim management experience.

I'm happy for you having the opportunity to do this "right", but if you weren't allowed to work during high school, or if your plans got pulled out from under you, then it gets **real hard** to even keep an upbeat attitude.

But, yes. When I hear people bitch and moan because they only make $15-20/hr... they could be doing so much worse.

And even *I'm* lucky to be working 40 hrs a week, so I could be doing so much worse. </TEXT>

Yeah, no... You lost points with that. I'm not saying the show is bad, but it is not the "classic" anime.

The basic problem with the chart is that it oversimplifies some sections and over complicates others. I would say that a website version of this with less humor and more thought would be better for recommendations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I put in a test pattern in the program, and told it to make an order... $11.95 is what it came up with. Forgive me, I don't have the exact numbers of colors, etc. related to it.

I may have underestimated the time aspect, but that only makes it *more* expensive to make and sell these for profit.

Ultimately, I want to make a profit. I want to do art that will sell to others, and not just spend money on a hobby.

The individual price point is low enough, I can probably make a single order to see if I find them easier to work with, but it is apparent that I would be selling them for higher prices than Perler sprites. </TEXT>

I think that the minimum wage should simply be *that* value. The minimum hourly pay for a single person, living alone, on bare essentials (the calculation does include a small amount extra for things like clothes, saving, or emergency, though it isn't enough for a retirement fund) if he works a full 40 hour week each week.

If you want to start a family, you should go look for a better job. But a single person shouldn't be struggling to make ends meet with a full time job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started at my last job at $6.25, 9 years ago. I was bumped up to $7.50 over the course of 5 years (mostly due to the minimum wage increase from $5.35 to $7.25).

I moved to this current job 4 years ago, starting at $7.75, and now make $8.50.

The 8 year price increase comment comes about from a realization that my boss had very recently. He bought a case of ice buckets for the rooms. The same price he paid for them 8 years ago, but only half the quantity.

If I can get him to understand that the prices are going up for everything, maybe, just maybe, he'll understand that my $8.50/hr isn't as great a wage as he thinks.  </TEXT>

Edit - I will correct myself on a particular error, as my "field of study" is science fiction and not philosophy. Dogs are not *sapient* creatures, that is we can not reason with them. The fact that they can not legally consent is the most important reason we can not have sex with them, still. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wait... the "bible-thumper" is arguing for gay marriage? And the atheist is against? Something is fishy there.

But anyway, marriage is a social construct that says that two people will be together for the rest of their lives, and thus enjoy certain rights, responsibilities, and privileges based on that promise.

Maternity wards are medical centers designed to help deliver children, not a social construct.

You drew the parallel to bestiality, necrophilia, and paedophilia, when you argued that gays "can't be married," just like one can't marry "a goat, a corpse, or a child" because you can't mate with them.

As for the right of the goat to consent... yes. If we are able to formally communicate, two-way, with a different species, then yes... we should be allowed to marry it if we want, even if we can't conceive.

Of age to mate can be as young as 9 or 10. The age of consent is based on the generally accepted age to grant consent (based on the ability to sign a contract). </TEXT>

<TEXT> One point of order.

Children can conceive relatively young, but it is highly dangerous. But if mating is your only concern, then man/child may be viable.

Beyond that, what about marriages among the infertile? The elderly? Or even marriages that don't want children?

If mating and procreation was the end-all beat-all, then a huge number of marriages aren't valid. </TEXT>

I did a test pattern using a picture I had lying around, the order would have cost $17.95, including shipping, so I'd have to charge at least $20 to make it worth it.

A $15 price point would only be viable if I plan and order for batches of products (occasionally, I wouldn't have to buy new beads because I'd have some left over from other projects).

<TITLE> Question/Poll for buyers of beadart - Should I switch from Perler to PixelHobby? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-08 06:24:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Pros - More colors, no ironing/misfiring, higher definition

Cons - Higher cost per bead (assuming larger purchasing amounts, $0.35/135 beads vs. $2/1000), boards are not reusable, pattern sizes are less flexible.

Because I have unsteady hands, I find it troublesome to iron pieces, making PH very attractive, but I fear that the higher cost is a turn-off to buyers. What do you think is more appropriate/appealing?

[Example of Pixel Hobby](http://kasiulai.lt/images/801001.png) - 1 panel + 2000 beads for about $15-20 (including time). Approx 4"x5"

[Example of Perler Beads](http://img13.deviantart.net/968a/i/2013/208/d/3/nyan_cat_perler_bead_by_kittyespeon-d6ffzp3.jpg) ~700 beads, $5-10 (including time). Approx 2.5"x 8"

If I switch systems, I'll be happy to sell off my existing Perler stock (for a good rate). </TEXT>

But, I will say this. It is nigh impossible to proof a negative. It falls on the positive claim to prove they are truth. For example, if I told you I flew to the store today, would you believe me without my proof? Should you be forced to give proof that I never left the ground?

Edit: A quick search reveals this...

Gordon B. Hinckley, prior President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1995-2008), said:

We are Christians in a very real sense and that is coming to be more and more widely recognized. Once upon a time people everywhere said we are not Christians. They have come to recognize that we are, and that we have a very vital and dynamic religion based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. We, of course, accept Jesus Christ as our Leader, our King, our Savior...the dominant figure in the history of the world, the only perfect Man who ever walked the earth, the living Son of the living God. He is our Savior and our Redeemer through whose atoning sacrifice has come the opportunity of eternal life. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints pray and worship in the name of Jesus Christ. He is the center of our faith and the head of our Church. The Book of Mormon is Another Testament of Jesus Christ and witnesses of His divinity, His life, and His Atonement. </TEXT>

Cruelty, as stated before, requires a malicious intent. So a punishment that might shock the sensibilities of a normal man, but was created unintentionally is unusual, but not cruel.

<TEXT> The confusion you are having is not with *my* language, but the language of the Amendment... "cruel and unusual punishment"

While it can be construed as only applying to such acts that are both cruel and unusual, it was obviously intended by the founders to prohibit either and both at once.

Thus, we have to legally define cruelty as well as unusuality in regard to punishment.

Since cruelty is primarily concerned with malicious intent, and incarceration is primarily concerned with protecting the innocent from the guilty, there is no cruelty simply borne from incarceration.

As for unusual punishment, incarceration generally does not shock the sensibilities of people, as it is reasonable to remove such persons from society. Plus, incarceration can be reversed and remedied, something that can not be done with death, dismemberment, or torture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, let's go with the italicized definition, instead of the more appropriate explanation.

 cruelty - The deliberate and malicious infliction of mental or physical pain upon persons or animals.

The same portion of "cruel and unusual punishment" *was* the part that I copied before. Nice try.

For "cruelty" to apply to judicial punishment, there needs to be deliberate harm and malicious intent.

For that definition, and is exclusive. English is funny that way.

If you cut off my leg with a hacksaw, for no reason but because you hate me, that demonstrates malice (evil intent) and deliberate action. It is assumed that if you have malicious intent, then you are deliberately acting.

However, if you cut off my leg with a hacksaw because we are climbing in the Alps and my leg is hopelessly pinned, then there is no malicious intent... it was a medical necessity.

Going back to the issue of incarceration of criminals, there is deliberate harm in locking a person up for longer than his child is in school, but there is no malicious intent. He is locked up because he needed to be separated from society.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, first off to ensure that you are not conflating the definitions...

 **cruelty** - As applied to people, cruelty encompasses abusive, outrageous, and inhumane treatment that results in the wanton and unnecessary infliction of suffering upon the body or mind.

By this definition, locking a criminal away (a necessary action) is *not* legal cruelty.

The more appropriate definition...

 **cruel and unusual punishment** - Such punishment as would amount to torture or barbarity, any cruel and degrading punishment not known to the Common Law, **or** any fine, penalty, confinement, or treatment that is so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community.

As you can see here, locking a criminal away for a reasonable length of time is not prohibited, because it is neither cruel (it is not torturous to remove a criminal from society), and it is not unusual if the length of time is reasonable. </TEXT>

In general, the signed cards will go $40-80 in the right circles, some unpopular ones will be $10-20, and some older cards will be more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Clearly. I don't like to levy such an accusation  (who am I kidding, I do), but without appropriate changes to the platform, this system has Pyramid written all over it.

Now, what can be done is to limit the campaigns to a window of time, and all donations to the system get split among active programs.

Have the length of time be 1 day, plus 1 day for an uploaded video, plus 1 day for promised stretch goals. Up to 3 days at a time.

The system has 99 slots (so each project gets 1 cent per dollar, with 1 cent going to the platform), and when one program expires, the next one on the list comes up.

A 1 year timeframe in that scenario can give funding to 12-36,000 projects without expanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay... so, what happens when new people stop coming into Enchain?

At $1.29/$4, it takes 3 or 4 donations to match your own.

By the time the first project is "funded" ($4), 4 people are in queue waiting for $4 each. A total of $16.

It would take an additional 12 donations to match those 4 projects, requiring $48 to fund everyone.

Eventually, you would get to a point where millions of projects are in the queue, unless you include a time limit to submit a project or include an option to fund without reciprocity. </TEXT>

Arthur was in the hospital for weeks because the wounds stayed magically open. They even tried stitches.

Because Nagini was a horcrux, her venom was magically magnified, just like the other horcruxes had their powers amplified.

The Cup and Diadem we never see in action.

The Diary gains an intelligence and talks back to the user.

The Locket holds itself shut unless spoken to in Parseltounge.

The Ring, which contained the Resurrection Stone, brought Death to the wearer.

Nagini caused wounds that do not heal quickly enough to survive (Arthur was kept alive long enough for the venom to work its way out).

Harry's connection to Voldemort was strengthened to a form of ESP. </TEXT>

Sometimes a ban is necessary. If you post naked pictures of children, you should be banned.

If you post the name, address, and photo of a person, with a message like "someone needs to rape this bitch", you should be banned.

If you upload videos of yourself killing people, you should be banned.

Of course, they should also send the information to the authorities.

So, you can't promise "No Banning, whatsoever" without opening yourself up to legal liability.

The goal we should be striving for is "if it is legal, you can post it" </TEXT>

<TEXT>  a couple of fries per day

That implies a restraint on eating that bodybuilders don't generally have.

[This](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-abcs-of-a-muscle-building-diet.html) article on bodybuilding.com shows the "recommended" diet for a bodybuilder who wants huge muscles...

For the 180 lb person in the example, they suggest a 3500 Calorie daily diet, including 180g of protein, 450g of carbohydrates, and 120g of fat.

Compare that to the standard weight-maintenance diet for a 180 lb person, 2000 Calories with no more than 300g of carbs and 65g of fat. Protein doesn't have a recommendation, but 180g is the equivalent of 30 eggs or about 9-15 hamburgers. </TEXT>

Timeline A: Sarah and unknown individual create John, Yadda Yadda. Skynet sends T-800 to the past. John-A sends Kyle Reese after it. (The events of Timeline A continue, so your Timeline B never occurs.)

Timeline B- Terminator 1. Sarah-B survives the T-800, has John, and is committed to a mental institution for claiming that robots from the future came back in time. John-B is raised by foster parents, and becomes more street smarts than John-A. John-B joins military service like many tough kids, and starts the resistance, along with Katherine Brewster. Skynet is accelerated by the remnants of the T-800, and sends a T-1000 to attack John. John sends a reprogrammed T-800 to defend himself.

Timeline C - Terminator 2. T-800 saves John and breaks Sarah from the mental institution, and forms a fatherly bond with John. T-800, T-1000, and all physical remnants are destroyed. (We assume.) Sarah trains John until she dies of cancer, John lives off the grid. Skynet is created in parallel construction by Katherine's father. John survives Judgement Day by not being in a major city, founds the resistance. Skynet sends a T-X, Katherine sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect.

Timeline D- Terminator 3. T-800 saves John and Katherine from T-X, attempts to stop Skynet from launching, gets them to a military bunker, where John founds the resistance. This is a 100% stable timeline, as Skynet is not hindered or helped in any way. It is as if they never sent back the T-X at all.

Where things get wonky is in the fact that the new movie has Skynet and the Resistance send fighters to *before* the events of Terminator 1, removing 2 and 3 from existence entirely. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Mr. Robot] Elliott is Mr. Robot. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-02 16:41:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Based on what little the show has told us so far, it seems to me that they are going full "Fight Club" and having the leader of the anonymous hacker group, Mr. Robot (played by Christian Slater) be a projection of Elliott's subconscious.

We have evidence that Elliott is an unreliable narrator. He is delusional, giving us narration as if talking to a voice in his head, goes on rambling conversations in his mind, and subconsciously hears every reference to "E Corp" (obviously a reference to Enron) as "Evil Corp", including in print. He is also a drug addict, who thinks his addiction is under control.

He encounters the hacker group when finding a file in one of his company's client's computers, and is almost immediately taken under the wing of Mr. Robot. Mr. Robot is cool, amicable, friendly. He gets along with others, makes plans, follows his goals. He is everything Elliott is not.

Almost immediately after this encounter, the CEO of Evil Corp is arrested based on evidence found in the hacker's program. Elliott, who only recently was let in on the plan celebrates as if he orchestrated it.

One of the girls in the group, seemingly second in command, is comfortable enough to take a shower at his place without telling him, as if they had known each other for a while.

All signs point to Elliott and Mr. Robot being the same person, with any direct interaction of the two (like when Mr. Robot pushed Elliott off the pier) being shown to us through the delusional filter of Elliott's mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you are saying, but at least this group was trying to address that body image is a problem for both genders.

And the statistics are not wrong, many men with body image problems turn to weightlifting. Why? Because we have to contend with amazingly large people! Arnold, Stallone, Lundgren, Farrigno, Tyson... the pressure isn't *usually* to get smaller, it is go get ripped.

When they work hard at the gym, and buy all the suppliments, and end up with only modest (realistic) gains, they turn to synthol and steroids to get bigger and better defined.

There are women with synthol and steroid problems, and men with eating disorders, but at least they are trying to address the overall problem. Body Image. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. So, if my "religious belief" is that I should only feed my children raw possum meat, should I be allowed to do that?

Of course not! They'd be dead quicker than you can blink.

Any reasonable person will admit that you can't claim personal freedom as an excuse to attack another person, and that includes passive harm.

Similarly, the First Amendment is not an absolute protection of your right to speak, specifically where such speech can bring harm to another party. You can not, for example, grab a bullhorn and tell an angry mob to break into a building and lynch its occupants.

Such exceptions to personal freedom are inevitable, and should be as limited as possible, but for vaccines to work *as many people as possible have to get the vaccination*.

If you don't want to vaccinate your kids, you will have to use alternative methods of educating them. You can find a private school that is willing to have a walking virus incubator attend, or you can teach them yourself at home. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. The problem at heart is "personal liberty". If you have a deeply held belief that you should not be vaccinated, who are they to tell you otherwise, right?

Well, personal freedom only extends to your own person. If your freely taken action brings harm to another, then you can not take that action.

The Libertarian school of thought states that such limitations should be as narrow as possible, and that interpretations of harm to others should be imminent and foreseeable. In that regard, your child not vaccinating and spreading a disease is *foreseeable*, but not imminent.

The Socialist school of thought is that limitations should be as broad as is necessary, and that harm be merely reasonable, and not imminent. It is reasonable to the average person that an unvaccinated child could become the vector for an outbreak, especially as it has happened recently.

Any good government must weigh both sides of this, and in their opinion (whether they are correct or not is a different matter) is that the protection of the people, as a whole, outweighs the risks to any one individual and the infringement of the usual right to personal freedom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to you.

Most people call any costuming "cosplay", partly because anyone who dresses up as a character is going to generally act like the character for pictures or among groups.

Those few who distinguish between them will generally draw the line at the dedication of the player. Buying a polyester, premade costume is just wearing a costume. Making or buying show-accurate or reimagined props and costumes is cosplay.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I understand what he/she was going at...

One of the big arguments in the gay community is that homosexuality is not a learned behavior, but a hard-coded preference. That men don't *choose* to like men, they just do.

The gay man in the argument said, "Who I choose to marry is none of your business." (I'm cleaning up the language because it isn't being told by a reliable narrator anyway.)

The bigot then has an a-ha moment, "But gay isn't a choice! So can you or can't you choose to be gay?"

The logic is there, if *and only if* you conflate the loving of a particular man with the loving of men in general. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This article](http://www.ushistory.org/us/21e.asp) gives a quick and dirty idea of what was going on.

Britain was wildly interfering with American independence by way of naval blockades and forts within American Territories where they armed Native fighters against us. When Madison declared war in 1812, it was to gain economic freedom to trade and deal with other countries.

And we very nearly lost, if it weren't for important rallying points, like Baltimore and New Orleans. Granted the effects of a loss may not have ultimately included direct subjugation, but we still would have been largely dependent on the British Empire. </TEXT>

<TEXT> World War II was very much a joint effort on both sides. Without the support of favored countries, Germany would have lost fairly quickly, and without help from the Americans, British, and French Resistance, the Soviets would have at best fought Hitler to a standstill.

So, yes. England won that war just as much as America or Russia did. </TEXT>

Because I think requiring consent to a search (or a duly issued warrant) is a good thing.

Choke holds are illegal, so they *should* be imprisoned for using them.

And it shouldn't even be a *question* on whether they give the number for the complaints. Why is it that I'm allowed to complain to McDonald's because my hamburger didn't have enough pickles, but we have to jump through hoops to complain about heavy-handed police tactics? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know about the first question, but maybe.

As for the rest, it wasn't a full redemption. She had to pay half the room rent each night (give or take) on her own card, but apparently the card they originally used was marked Lost, making it invalid.

I certainly understand the frustration they had, but it wasn't something we could just sit on for an indefinite period of time. I actually gave them longer than I gave the other two declinations. But we were already having to turn people away at that time.

From our standpoint, we easily could have resold the room, waiting until 11pm to cancel, but there would be (and I'm only exaggerating a little here) 100 renters we *could* have taken in instead of the person with the bad card. But our policy is simply that if your payment is not valid, we cancel your room. Because otherwise, we will get people making reservations with bad credit cards because (a) they don't have to wait for a return on the authorization and (b) they can avoid paying a no-show charge if they decide not to come in after all. </TEXT>

You borrowed the money, ran up the bill, or used a service, and didn't pay for it. You know that you did it, and you don't want to or can not pay.

Because roughly half of the debts bought by debt collectors are not documented properly, especially after it has gone through multiple collection agencies, it is a simple process to *say* you don't recognize it and demand proof. If they give proof, they can't accuse you of lying (many people forget about the doctor visit from 4 years ago) and you can work with them to get back on track, including making a pay to delete arraignment. If they can't give proof, it disappears... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Summer weekend in a beach town means a full house.

We went through the arrivals today, as is tradition, and preauthorized the credit cards on file. One of the few reservations to decline was a Brand Loyalty Partial Payment room.

After confirming that we are allowed to cancel, I called the guest and left a message about the room. It was about 8:30, but we were already having to turn people away who wanted to pay properly for the room. I gave them until 9:30 to update their payment, or it will be canceled.

9:30 passes without contact, and I cancel the room as promised. The room is almost immediately rebooked by a new guest.

10:10, we finally get a call back from the guest, a sweet old lady who sadly was brought to tears that I had to give away the room, but she seemed to understand the situation.... Then she called her son, Fezzik.

The conversation was a little too long for a post here, but suffice it to say every sentence out of his mouth was about my incompetence.

I let it slide for a while, telling him what happened. No, sir, we don't attempt the card until the day of arrival because we don't want an issue with voluntary cancellations. No, sir, we can't hold an invalid reservation indefinitely. No, sir, we don't have another room of that type of give. (We only had singles for the multiple days).

Incompetence, incompetence, incompetence. Every answer I gave as to why we can't simply rebook the room as it was an excuse to hide my incompetence.

I finally broke. "Sir, you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

Obviously, that didn't help at all, but it was so satisfying. I calmed down a bit after.

We traded question and answer like this for a good 10 minutes, and I was getting more agitated because I was constantly repeating myself and trying to deal with other phone calls and guests who I could help.

I finally told him flat out, "the only incompetence here is your own. We trusted that you gave us a valid card, we contacted you as soon as we knew it declined, and we gave you time to fix the problem. If you have any *new* questions, I'll try to answer, but otherwise I'm going to hang up now."

As soon as the word incompetence came from his lips again, it didn't take long, I released the call. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work for Verizon, and while those terms were the justification at that time, +-10 years ago, the reality was that it didn't matter which phone you got (or even if you got a phone at all), or when you cancelled the contract, the ETF was $250.

Our standard practice if you called in during the last month of service was to tell you to wait until the day after the contract expires to cancel  (which usually means we've charged your card for another month and you have to wait to be refunded the difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For Junk Debt Buyers, the business is a numbers game. They *know* that most people are not going to pay in full, and many people will either refuse to pay or find a loophole to get out of the debt.

So, they get lax on the paperwork.

The more your debt is, and the more profit it stands to make them, the more likely they will have the appropriate paperwork.

If you owe some company $100, you can probably get it thrown out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. The connection between Star Trek and Seinfeld goes through the John Larroquette Show.

Star Trek and JL both reference the fictional company Yoyodyne (Not necessarily canon). JL crossed over into Frasier (Canon), which crossed into Caroline in the City, to Friends, to Mad about You, to Seinfeld.

Happy Days is only connected to Friends directly through St. Elsewhere, through a very long connection that I won't spell out.

The problem with the theory is in the fact that many of there "crossovers" are really just two completely different shows referencing the exact same fictional company (like the Star Trek example above), and aren't really in the same universe. Plus the fact that some of the crossovers are specifically alternate universes or TV shows within the TV show, or silly non-canon appearences, like the famous John Munch on Sesame Street.

It's an interesting example of how TV shows connect with each other, but it isn't exactly canonized. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, because of the fact this app can't access play data of most games, it will be next to impossible to police.

On the other hand, the payout can be automated to not require mediation. The two players come back to the app, and it simply asks "who lost?" The loser presses that button, releasing the funds.

If they have a game in progress (neither player presses that they lost) for a certain period of time after the end of the game, then the game is simply cancelled, and both players are refunded. The game gets marked as abandoned, and used as a player ranking (using a percentage of completed games).

If you see someone with a low completion ranking, you decline to take their bets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a valid argument, for one simple reason.

If you try and stop me from commenting because I *could* post a link to child porn, then you are in the wrong.

If you try and stop me from commenting because I *actually* post a link to child porn, then you are taking a correct action.

Removing free speech and expression because of a hypothetical is never appropriate.

How does this factor into your question?

You postulated that they only removed your link, and the subverse that it was posted on, because of what it means to their bottom line, and not because of any moral reason. And again, I ask... Isn't that enough?

If they start banning people for *moral* reasons, then we'll start seeing bans of unpopular subjects like /v/atheism, /v/christianity, /v/politics, /v/libertarianism, or other subs that one person or another finds objectionable.

By only banning people when it becomes *legally necessary*, they protect persons like yourself while allowing the average, law-abiding user to spout out whatever shit they want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> James and Lily were married for over a year, as were the Longbottoms.

If (and I emphasize the if) Marlene was born a McKinnon, and married in the incredibly short time between the picture being taken and her death, it stands to reason that her marriage might not have been common knowledge.

If she was already married to a non-Order member, then she wasn't a McKinnon in school. (Yes, she technically could have been one, but the odds of such a pairing are incredibly low, even in a close community like the Wizarding World).

If she was never married at all, then the family that was killed was likely her parents.

But, the Order itself was a very tight group. It is highly unlikely that a wife would be in the Order without her husband (Moody goes through a number of couples in the photograph), so the assumption is that she is not married, since a husband was never married.

Now, there is another possibility that hasn't been mentioned yet...

Marlene may have been gay. We know that Rowling intended for some characters to be homosexual, and an unmarried woman in a fighting position may not have married because one woman can not marry another (We never see such a marriage at least.). In this scenario, Moody would have respected her as a person and comrade-in-arms, but not been comfortable talking about such matters with others.

Which one is right? Only JK Rowling knows for sure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The passage where Moody shows off the picture, he calls her "Marlene McKinnon" and then states that she died 2 weeks after the picture was taken.

Even if she was born a McKinnon, and married in between those two events, she would have been remembered as Marlene McKinnon.

If she was born a McKinnon, then she almost certainly died unmarried, and her parents and siblings were killed with her. </TEXT>

Unless there was additional info in Pottermore, the books never mention her husband by name. Marlene was standing alone in the picture of the Order. If her husband was the McKinnon, she could have been named *anything* during school. If she was named McKinnon, it is likely that she wasn't married, and the family that died included her parents and siblings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the problem that these authors have is the fact that we don't know a lot about the people that went to school with the Marauders.

So, authors latch onto any little detail they can find and figure out a way to include it.

Lily's best friend in Hogwarts, at the very beginning, was almost certainly Severus. They knew each other before school for years, and were all but destined to be together... until they were Sorted.

With Lily in a different House, she would have made new friends with her fellow First Years, and quickly gained a closeness associated with "best friends", but she didn't drop Severus until he called her a Mudblood.

Assuming Marlene was the same year and House as her, she could have been one of her closest female friends, explaining why she cried when she heard the news, but it wasn't the same level of closeness that she once had with Severus or grew to have with the Marauders.

Thus, Lily's best friend was Severus, and when that friendship died she eventually latched onto the Marauders directly, becoming close enough with them to trust Wormtail and Sirius with her protection just as much as James did. </TEXT>

I don't have a problem with them choosing Miles Morales to be the MCU Spider-Man. It would be a *great* way to differentiate the character from the Sony Pictures Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man.

I also understand the reasoning behind using Peter Parker for the specific role, because of the back story and the overall effect of him revealing his identity during Civil War.

On the broader sense, if you want to see a new powerful black hero, make a new one (like the new Ms. Marvel). Or take an older one and make him into a more powerful character (like the MCU Falcon). But don't change the race of existing characters and pretending it doesn't change their history. </TEXT>

AC makes (let's say) $5,000,000. They take $1,000,000 of that and put it to develop a new AC game. They then take another $1,000,000 and start developing a new IP, like Watch_Dogs, which may or may not profit.

If WD makes enough, they will do the same thing, take some of the profits and make WD2, and some to make a third game. If it doesn't, then they abandon the IP and just work on the third. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. In regards to legality, making a print of a character has a few things you have to watch for.

First and foremost, is transformation. If you are simply copying an iconic Wolverine comic book cover, then you are violating both trademark and copyright laws. You didn't design the piece, you didn't design the character. It isn't yours to sell.

Second, is replicability. The more easily replicated the artwork, the less likely it will be sued over. You try to sell scribbled drawings of Wolverine on paper, and you'll probably be hit with a C D. You make one 10 foot tall sculpture, and you probably will be congratulated by the artist (unless you piss him off).

That leads into the third point, flattery. If you make said sculpture with Wolverine being raped by Kitty Pryde, they'll come onto you like a hobo on a ham sandwich. If the sculpture depicts him in his iconic crouching pose with blades extended, they will look at it more favorably.

Fourth, and maybe the most important, is competitiveness. If you make a comic book featuring their character, then you are potentially cutting into their profits. Changes you make to the character can erroneously be seen as endorsed by the creators, which leads to problems. The aforementioned 10 foot tall statue, on the other hand, doesn't compete with their property. The people that would buy such a thing will probably be buying the legit art, too.

Now then, Etsy is in a strange position. They don't make anything, except the website. However, enough people are on it that they have to tread extra carefully to avoid C D letters from the property owners.

Because of the points I laid out before, most companies are okay with the creation of fan art. They even encourage it. But if too much goes on in a site like Etsy, Marvel may come down on them.

In response to your question, superhero *posters* would be a definite infringement based on competitiveness. If you wish to fight a C D for your work, you would likely lose, due to the fact that Marvel and DC sell their own posters of characters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay... refund policies for artwork are a very touchy subject.

You should ensure your product is packed well, giving extra space in case of box damage etc.

If you do that, you can have your refund policy be on a case by case basis. Officially, you list no refunds. Then, if someone contacts you and asks for a refund for a reason you don't think is valid (for example, if they call you a few days after getting the package, saying it was damaged in transit), you can simply say "no refunds". The rare case where they show you that something horrible happened, you can grant an exception.

After all, you are the owner of your "business". </TEXT>

Is it the medium? Does canvas and paint have more right to be called "art" than crayon and construction paper?

Question 1 - How "new" is your friend?

Is this someone you've known for a few months from work, but don't have any newer friends than them?

Or is it someone that you met within the past few weeks?

Question 2 - How are they selling the car?

If they are selling to a guy on Craigslist, do they have a way of trusting the transaction?

Question 3 - Why can they not cash or deposit the check themselves?

Even if they don't have a bank account, most banks will allow an account to be opened with an initial check deposit. There is little reason to take a check for someone else.

If you can not answer those questions satisfactorily, or if the answers make you uncomfortable, *do not perform the transaction*. </TEXT>

If it is insane to have an opinion, even a *wrong* opinion (which is your opinion), then lock me up in a padded cell.

**WARNING - My Opinion**

Tidal *can* offer whatever terms it wants, but ultimately they are the weaker service when it comes to the one metric that matters... The number of subscribers.

If Tidal were to be *smart* about it, they would say that musicians should have *some* exclusivity with Tidal, instead of trying to strongarm them into full exclusivity. And strongarm it is, since they try to make all the **small** artists exclusive, but the **big names** can choose to go to other services.

For example... [Kanye West](https://play.spotify.com/user/xpoplicola/playlist/77fa6y3frmLh2Jn2J3d6Xn), [Jay-Z](https://play.spotify.com/artist/3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB), [Daft Punk](https://play.spotify.com/artist/4tZwfgrHOc3mvqYlEYSvVi)... All still on Spotify, but if I make a song, and I want it on Tidal, I have to sign an exclusivity contract.

I'm sorry, but this is less a theory and more a fanfiction.

First, there is no discrepancy solely contained in Disc 1, unless you accept this to be true from the start. And the only weirdness is the shared vision on the train.

Quistis hit on Squall early on because they are roughly the same age, and he is single and attractive.

Everything else here can't be disproven, the same way you can't disprove that I saw a dragon last night.

No matter how abhorrent that was, it needed to survive for the simple purpose of understanding the times.

Should I throw away someone else's copy of the Bible, or go into Barnes and Noble and tear up copies of Fifty Shades of Grey?

Maybe the book didn't belong in the school library. Maybe the book isn't appropriate for most contexts. But you absolutely do not destroy a book. </TEXT>

It was one of the Sword of Truth novels, Temple of the Winds.

Kahlan and Richard are taken into separate tents and told they have to consummate their marriages to other people (even though they love each other only. It's a magic thing.).

However, Richard was swapped with the other guy, because of shenanigans and since they weren't allowed to say anything Kahlan didn't know.

They bone, which to her felt like she was being violated, no matter how well Richard treated her, then she realized that for the magic to work she had to enjoy herself.

So she goes a second time, being more forceful, with Richard knowing that she thinks he is the other guy. She cums like their is no tomorrow, and then "surprise! You just raped your husband!" </TEXT>

It's about punishment. The idea that we would agree to take rapists, mass murderers, baby killers, and (ultimately because we need it for the story) over muscled political dissodents, and have them be publically hunted for sport is... a little far fetched.

Especially when today we live in a society that give Charles Manson a token parole hearing. It would take a *lot* of changes, not limited to the complete repealing of the Constitution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a very cruel fate to be taken as a boy and given the power, and responsibilities, of a god.

Look at all the boy heroes out there. They mostly turn out "okay" (Tim Drake), but they are damaged goods, the lot of them.

Their friends are mostly people they fight alongside, their family are targets. Most of them end up hiding their identities to protect the ones they love. If they are lucky, their human friends don't turn into supervillains.

I'm not saying "superhero is the worst thing ever", but if you are saddled with that burden and given superspeed, superstrength, or magic powers, you are following a hard path...

And if you are a good person, you are not going to ignore it. </TEXT>

If they were to do this regularly, the students have an encouragement to default, the schools would raise tuition rates to raise the value of the unpaid debts and get as much as they can out of the paid ones, and the losers would be the people who donated money.

The squirrel did not have any ill intent when it got itself electrocuted, it was neutral. Such an accident would be seen by everyone around as a freak occurrence. The power company and electricians would see it as the cost of doing business, and the customers would see it as an inconvenience.

In the long run, the customers only lose out if they decided to go to a hotel while the power is fixed (a completely optional choice), and the electric company would take repair costs out of preassigned funds, with likely no effect on the bottom line.

In this particular case, the destruction has a benefit of keeping electricians in work and in practice, at the cost of customers being a little hot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thankfully, it is mostly political idiots that claim global warming will cause any sort of short term flooding situation...

But it should be noted that according the the US Geological Survey, we are in an expected period of warming, which in previous Epochs have caused sea levels to rise up to 20 meters beyond the current levels. Soon, in that context could be 1000 years.

Would a 20 meter rise in sea level be devestating to a low-lying city, like New Orleans? Yes. Beyond yes.

Can we do anything about it? No. We can only move away from the shores.

It is mostly alarmists that make specific claims about short term effects of global warming. But that warming is happening, with or without us. When the glaciers have finally melted, then the Earth starts to bounce back and cool off again, and in about 20,000 years or so, our descendants (should they still be around) will be complaining how their technologies are causing more and more ice to form. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because it is a good question.

In this case, if the killings were racially motivated (as it seems they are), then he killed the kids because he hates blacks. Old or young, it doesn't matter.

If there is a different motivation, then there could be any number of reasons why he would attack children.

The scary part about all this is that he attacked a church.

I'm not religious, but when people go to church, they expect to be safe. Even when the sex scandals were at their peak, parents felt save with their children there. It is a sanctuary, in much more than the religious sense. People like this violate that basic security. </TEXT>

Civil disobedience is where you break the law to protest the law.

You can and will be arrested for an act of civil disobedience, the difference will be how the public, jury, and media will see it.

Woman walks around without a top? She'll be given at best a fine, and we'll all talk about letting women go topless.

Black people sit at a restaurant counter where the owner only serves whites? They're heroes (but will still probably be in jail for it).

The buses here run between 30 and 60 minutes between buses during the week, covering the vast majority of the city with 1-2 transfers.

Bus routes run from 6ish to 9ish, with some outliers.

Sunday, you may as well take a cab. Half of the routes don't run, and many run as far as 90 minutes apart.

Seriously, as someone who doesn't drive, if you can drive - do it.

As for the issue of the livability in the city, rent will be a minimum of $525 for most places, upwards of $1000 or more in others. If you make anywhere near minimum wage ($10.00/hr or less), you will need a roommate or second earner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't imagine how hard it is to replace a custom guitar on short notice.

Plus, insurance might cover the replacement of the original, but might not pay for the one used temporarily.

If these guys were bigger, they could easily sell off the "loaner", maybe even for more than they paid for it, but that's still a lot of money to hold in limbo.

I only wish I could do something to help, even if it is just loaning my Bullet out for the "cost" of an autograph and maybe a restringing (if they needed to).

If they post for help in Austin-centric boards, they might get similar offers to help.

Edit - Note, while I am serious about lending my guitar, I'm in Corpus,  not Austin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regarding the Big 3, I would put it this way.

Rule 1: Show, don't tell, but have your characters see, not say.

Dialogue is great for showing a character's emotion, but poor for world-building. Don't have the characters talk about how bleak the landscape is, show them in the remainder of the paragraphs. (Example: Lord of the Rings)

Rule 2: If you can not write about what you know, then know about what you write.

You probably don't know what it feels like to fling fireballs at a rampaging werewolf, because it can't happen. So, you have to think about and understand the effects in the context of your own world. If you can understand how it works in your world, you can explain it to others. (Example: Eragon)

Rule 3: Always have a sympathetic character for the reader to relate to, even if they don't like him very much.

Your main character, or someone in his entourage, must be someone the reader can sink into. They can be the most horrible person in the universe, but the reader will need to understand, at some point, the motivations of the character. The Why of his evil. If you can not show that from the perspective of the main character, shift the perspective to his Companion. (Examples: Doctor Who/Sherlock Holmes) </TEXT>

<TEXT> In general, yes.

But if one were to write 20 page long short stories, most people that start it will finish it, regardless of quality. 1,000,000 people means 20,000,000 pages read per story.

If he writes 10 short stories in the time it takes a novelist to write 300 pages, and 1,000,000 people download each of them, the short story author gets 200,000,000 shares, and the novelist might get 300,000,000 if he did well enough that every finished the book. </TEXT>

So, if you write a 10,000 page series that is downloaded 1,000,000 times, but people universally get sick of reading it after 10 pages (like if it became a viral sensation for how horrible it is), you get paid for 10,000,000 pages.

If you write a 200 page novel that is read in its entirety by 500,000 people, you get paid for 100,000,000 pages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really it's just a code-word for "we fudged some of this stuff anyway"

For example, black holes don't *actually* have infinite density, they have **indefinite** density.

Basically, once the event horizon exists outside of the physical body, you can no longer measure how small the mass at the center is.

We can calculate the mass based on gravitational effects, which is how we know that one black hole the size of Mars holds approximately 1000 Suns, but it doesn't make a difference if that mass is the diameter of the Moon or a grain of sand. It is all underneath the Event Horizon.

However, because the diameter can not be calculated, equations that need that figure can plug in "infinity" and still work. </TEXT>

Lady: oh, and we need toast, too.

Me: Sure, I'll be able to replace the bread stuff.

Lady: There's bagels and all, but no toast.

Me: Okay, I'll get right on it.

I go, fix up the coffee pot that had just finished brewing and check which bread we need... and there is a whole tray of bread! I don't get it, did she expect me to make her her toast?

I point it out to her royal highness, wait a few minutes for the sausage to finish and bring it out. What do I see in the chafing dish? Omelets! There aren't many left, but they weren't out.

I think she was just trying to find reasons to complain, as if it isn't bad enough they have obviously way too many kids for their room. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Most Super Sentai shows start off with a standalone enemy threatening world destruction or domination, but they are never confronted by previous Super Sentai.

After they become a fully fledged team, they begin to interact with other teams as if they existed together.

Some previous enemies will even show themselves as enemies of the newer teams.

In all media that focuses on more than one team, the passage of time stated between the two shows is sometimes longer than the actual time difference between them.

Most importantly, in Battle Fever J, the enemy Satan Egos was able to sense when the Battle Fever team was given their powers. This may have been caused by him sensing the shift from the original Battle Fever universe to that of the Sentai universe.

This shifting would also explain how the dinosaurs were destroyed in 4 different manners and created 4 different unique Sentai. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So, I'm getting ready to talk to my boss about our pay... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-04 15:22:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's criminally low in some cases (night auditors are being paid under the table below minimum wage). For those of us who are legal, he tries to keep us as close to minimum wage as possible.

This is painful for us, because even being the highest paid desk clerk ($8.25/hr) isn't enough to pay the bills at home, and I'm having to borrow money off of future paychecks to cover them.

I counted out all of the hours worked this week by all the hourly workers, and if we assume this was an average week, then they pay about $12.28 per room-night for employees.

Raising the rate of pay for everyone to $10.00/hr would increase that average to $17.10.

That seems daunting, but the ADR has gone up over $10 since last year, because of rate increases.

Furthermore, if he were to continue paying the night shift as he has, it could bring the average down to under $15 a room. (I hate to throw the students under the bus, but the boss might not care about helping them at all.)

Ironically, the fact that he pays so badly is the reason why my job is secure enough for me to bring it up to him. No one wants to work starting at $7.50, with an occasional  $0.25 raise. (I started at $7.75 because I had 5 years experience, and I've been here 4 years.) So, most people that get hired don't even bother showing up for training once they hear the pay offer.

For that $5 a room, my boss would shift from being one of the worst paying employers in the city to one of the best that isn't in the oil refineries.

But, I wonder if he even cares enough to listen...

If he doesn't, then I'll just have to look for a new job, because he pays his assistant manager less than a guy that flips burgers under a heat lamp. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We had one woman (we'll call her Monica) check in a couple weeks ago. A local, paying with cash.

She stays over day by day, doesn't really give us too much trouble, just paying late... until Monday last, when they decided they were going to check out.

Monday night, a group of 3 people from their room rush upstairs, break into a second room, and beat and rob the guest there. Unfortunately, we didn't know it was them until they had already left. (My boss didn't watch the whole tape until the morning.)

Needless to say, she was put on the Do Not Rent list, which I have tacked in the front with names, ID numbers, and the reason they are banned.

Fast forward to today, just now. I come in to work after a nice carefree weekend, and hear a woman screaming in the hallway, being chased, beaten, and dragged back into the back hallway towards their room. I called 911, found which room they were in, and they ask me who rented the room... it was Monica.

One of my idiot colleagues rented her a room again, even when we have her on a Do Not Rent list for robbery and assault!

I go down to keep an eye on the hallway as the police do their thing, and what do you know, they have a dog! They admit to me that they know the dog isn't allowed, but they "didn't have any other place to go".

And to make matters worse, the guy was caught with a huge packet of Synthetic and a grinder filled with marijuana... in the room with his 3 year old daughter!

The piece of shit was arrested, and I got the distinct "pleasure" of telling an assault victim with no ID and a toddler to find other accommodations.

And later, when I tell my boss what happened, I'll probably be yelled at for calling 911.

So, how's *your* Sunday? </TEXT>

<TITLE> So, I want to turn fan art into something legitimate. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-18 20:05:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The fan art community is one of the strangest things I've seen. People make figures, drawings, paintings, and other works of art, sometimes in complete opposite directions as the original work. 

They sell these works at conventions with near complete impunity, and only get C D generally when the work is closer to plagerism. However, they operate under a constant knowledge that the hammer may drop at any time.

So, my question is, "What is the best way to seek permission from the appropriate company to create and sell art based on their characters?"

Should I only send correspondence by regular mail, or is sending an email acceptable? 

Should I begin my offer only with a request to sell the art and copies of that work, or should I include the secondary acceptable offer of making the pieces directly for a commission?

Do I even need to worry about it? If the works are obviously of my own energy, and not damaging to the brand in question (there is no official outlet for this style of art), could this be considered "fair use"?

And, for a final and more specific question. The character from my initial piece is from the Japanese show "Super Sentai", owned by Bandai and Toei. The rights in America for the show are owned by Haim Saban. Who should I attempt to contact, as an American artist, Toei or Saban? The original artwork will only be made one time, and prints would be available worldwide.

Thank you in advance, if I should consult an attorney, I would love to have a suggestion for which one in the Corpus Christi area, if available, or one that consults by phone.  </TEXT>

How likely are crowdfunders to buy raffle tickets?

What would be an appropriate ticket cost/prize value ratio?

How frequently should I make the drawings?

I have considered allowing prize donations from others to sweeten the pots, as well as increasing the value of the prizes if I "sell too many tickets", but is there anything else I can do to make this a success? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ... can they do a Magical Boys anime that isn't... girly?

I started doing a writeup of costuming and theme to make a more serious version, mixing elements of Sailor Moon with the live action Super Sentai.

I wrote out the whole thing, making suggestions along the way (I hadn't posted it, because I hadn't gotten the reference pictures for it), and realized that someone *had* already made a serious Magical Boys anime, that had certain parallels to Sailor Moon without being a parody of the genre...

Yoroiden Samurai Troopers, also known as Ronin Warriors, featured an all-male troop of young men who transformed into powerful ronin. The costuming was mostly angular (straight lines are more visually masculine compared to curves), had little frills or excess (especially in the sub-armor form).

Like Sailor Moon, they fought with their faces uncovered, but (as fitting for the more stoic men) focused less on battle speeches and more on weapons and attacks.

It was funny, I watched the whole series when it came out, and nearly forgot about it when it was most appropriate...

So, the real question is... can we do a show like this again? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday, one of our regular, problem guests checks out of her room without saying anything. No big deal, happens all the time, but housekeeping needed my help getting inside the room.

On entering, I see ash from a cigarette on the nightstand next to the bed.

She comes back today (with the frequency that she does this, I'm sure she is a prostitute) looking for a room. I tell her flatly that she was smoking in the room before and because it was a nonsmoking room she would have to pay a cleaning fee.

 I didn't smoke in the room, though. I don't smoke cigarettes.  
 My friend might have done some marijuana...

I tell her that regardless of the kind of cigarette, there is no smoking allowed in the room, and she doubles down.

 My friend was probably just rolling a blunt...

I let the comment pass the first time, but I had to speak up.

 Don't tell me you're doing marijuana in the rooms, because that's illegal. If you want to stay, you will have to stay in a smoking room, and you'll have to pay a cleaning fee for smoking in our nonsmoking room.

 How much is that?

 $50 (our reg card says we can charge up to $250)

She left, and I doubt she'll return while I am working. (But, she'll probably try and see if the night guys go easy on her.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry about the long one.

We had a power outage last night. Nothing major, just an idiot crashing into a pole.

Of course, everyone demands special treatment in the morning because of it. Most of the people were happy to get a $10 discount and be done with it, some didn't even ask for that much...

But there is always one.

He comes in around 10:30, and asks us to comp him the entire room for his stay. I tell him, "No. I can't do that. And with your room paid through a third party, I can not adjust your rate. But, if you stay over tonight and pay with me, I'll give the room for $69.95 ($15 off the current room rent)"

Well, that isn't good enough for them, because they use some weird referral system that pays out in room discounts, so they were getting the room for like $62.

So, they go off and decide to use that system to get the room again, asking for a little extra time to complete it. I tell them that I can give until 11:30, half an hour past checkout.

About 11:20 he comes back in and says that he forgot some paperwork in the room, and he'll need to get it to pay. At 11:45 he tells me that he needs until 12:30.

At 12:15, his wife/girlfriend/drug-addicted-crack-ho comes out, saying they need until 1... at this point, I tell her flat out, "we can not keep waiting like this. You need to take care of this right away."

"Okay, I know... But your Internet wasn't working right and you just need to give us more time! Oh, and can I get some fresh towels."

I reiterate that housekeeping is waiting on her to pay for the room, and that we will not provide housekeeping in any form until it is done.

1 PM rolls around... still no payment. I call her this time, and she tells me she needs another 15 minutes... That she is putting in the information right then, and it will be showing up on the computer any minute.

No such luck.

1:10 - I call her back, and she says that it is *literally* being processed and it will only be another 6 minutes.

Now, at this point, I'm tired of the excuses. I told her flat out that we need this done *now*, and if it doesn't happen, I'll be contacting the police to evict her.

Wouldn't you know it... nothing happens.

So, I call the police (non emergency) and have them send a uni. While waiting for that, the guest comes out "trying to get the room taken care of". Even though she already told me that it was being processed. Cops drive up, and she goes back to the room.

They talk a few minutes, and she gets them to admit that if I can be convinced to accept payment, she can stay, so she comes back to the desk.

I stick to my guns, but there is one factor I can't control.

My boss decided to walk out from the back. I kept him out of this for a reason. He has a pathological fear of confrontation with guests, and if you talk to him, you'll probably get your way. And sure enough... the guest waves cash at his face, even though it's 2 PM and the police are here to remove her, and he says just let her stay.

Every god damned time. Bring in a pet? He'll break his own posted rules to let you stay. Smoke in a nonsmoking room? Don't worry about it.

He's so interested in the online reviews that he would probably let someone rent a room with money that was stolen from him.

TL;dr guest refuses to pay until police are actually there to evict her 3 hours late, boss lets her stay anyway.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ... and she felt there was something a bit off. She couldn't even explain to me what she didn't like about the episode.

[Lamebrained theory](#s "My thought was that feeling of unease was intentional by the directors, mimicking the Doctor's faulty regeneration and memory issues. Case in point, the scene at the end, where the robot may have jumped or the Doctor may have thrown him. Even *he* doesn't know what actually happened.")

I think the visual direction of the show is meant to mimic the personalities of the Doctor.

If anyone can make a short, less than 1 minute scene with Jace directing his Tidal Warrior (or other blue creature less than 3/3) to attack Chandra, who blocks it with a Cinder Wall, and you would be willing to work on other short videos for the same purpose, please contact me.

Videos will be uploaded onto a YouTube channel and linked to my website at www.betonwhite.com, with links to your personal website or YouTube channel.

<TEXT> We have a swim meet this weekend here in town, and of course that means that a number of teams are staying at the hotel. 

They *all* want to leave their stuff in the rooms, go to the meet in the morning, come back around 2, shower and get their stuff, and leave around 3 PM.

Naturally, with our checkout time at 11AM, I had to deny their requests.

At least one team just decided they were going to take it anyway. I might have to just charge them for tonight, a couple more want to complain to my boss, which won't do much good, though they will probably lie on me and say that I was incredibly rude (the standard when someone is told "no"), which my boss will believe and I'll get in trouble. 

But if I just let half a dozen rooms leave whenever they want, I'll get in trouble for that. </TEXT>

All this sounds like a sob story by a homeless guy to stay in the lobby, right?

Another guest comes in while he's there, asks about rates, etc, and when she leaves, he pops up with a rifle scope in his hands, saying "she wouldn't even know what hit her" and starts talking about his skills at killing people.

I'm wondering if I should put a tip into Mental Health once we have him in a room. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lady came in with an Expedia reservation. I ask for her ID and credit card and she gives me the usual "They've already charged it." speech.

I remind her that we just need a valid card in case of incidental charges, and she asks if I'm going to run her card. Now, I don't normally run the cards, but 9 times out of 10 when they ask me that, they are giving me a bad one. So, I reiterate that the card just needs to be valid (basically, she just has to tell me it is, because we don't have a way of checking without charging).

So, she gets angry with me, and we finish the check-in, finally. I point out her room on the map, point out where she can park, direct her to the stairwell, and she leaves kind of hurried.

My manager, who was in the lobby to supervise the painters, asks me to go up to check on a room that had a problem reported, and as I am coming down the stairs, I end up meeting the family I just checked in.

 Where's the room, Mom?

 I don't know, that asshole didn't tell me.

She sees me up the stairs, looking at her.

 Yeah, I called you an asshole!

I say nothing and finish walking down the stairs, and I see them starting to pass the stairs to go into the first floor hallway. I step back closer to the wall and point up the stairs,

 Your room is up this way, ma'am.

 It's upstairs? Don't you have an elevator?

 No, I'm sorry.

She rushes past me, moving up the stairs with her 7 and 12 year old children.

 Stupid asshole...

 Ma'am, if you are not happy here, you can stay somewhere else...

I turned my back to her.

 And that's great parenting, by the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mattresses, the nightstand, the microwave, the couch. They left the TVs only because they were bolted down.

I called the police and they tried to force me into a telephone report, instead of sending an officer as I requested.

Edit with updates - We found which guest had done this, they were checked into the room right next to the original crime scene.

After coaxing the police to come in, they said that they wouldn't be able to process the room for fingerprints or other evidence. They gave their case numbers and went to the car to file the report. 

Housekeeping calls me almost immediately to let me know that the neighboring room was having trouble with the lock, and that they had seen guests climbing in and out through the window. I open the door and find the room in worse shape than the first.

The light fixtures had been torn from the bathroom, the bed was simply gone, the television was on the ground and the dresser it had been bolted to was missing, the couch and recliners were gone, the second bed was wrecked, and naturally they took the mini fridge and microwave.

So I got the attention of the cop again, and now we have a crime scene tech going over the rooms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a warning for customers and businesses. I apologize if this isn't the best location for this.

Apparently, scam artists have found a way to tap into 800 numbers while they are queuing for an operator. When the call is redirected, a foreign operator will apologize for the long hold time and offer a gift card or other compensation, and ask for a credit card for processing fees.

Obviously, you should never give out credit card information for unsolicited items, nor should you ever give credit card information in order to get money from a company.

If you fall prey to this scam, make sure you advise the company that there may be unknown recurring charges, and treat your credit/debit card as stolen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at a sunny motel, all but managing the breakfast area in addition to front desk, and recently Corporate made the unilateral decision to change all of the breakfast items to be "healthy".

They took out a lot of the sweet items, like danishes, and replaced them with better choices, like cinnamon raisin bread.

The problem was, our location had previously had the best breakfast we could manage for our class of hotel.

The changes meant that instead of hand-cooked scrambled eggs and sausage, we had to make precooked omelets with 'cheese'. Our breads were almost all replaced by the cinnamon bread. We had to stop giving out oatmeal in the instant packets, and had to cook oatmeal in a kettle daily.

Needless to say, our guests are not happy. The omelets taste horrible and take forever to heat up. The oatmeal takes an hour to be ready to eat. We have a much lower variety of food, thanks to getting rid of most of our breads.

I was planning on calling to the GM hotline to give them a piece of my mind...

When the breakfast director called me, asking how the new breakfast was working out. And I told her the truth. It stinks.

We at the hotel hate it, because of the time it takes to prepare. The guests hate it because they were used to a wider variety from us.

I told her that we need a waiver to allow us to go back to the sausage and eggs and to put out the instant oatmeal again.

I also told her that we need to be given discretion on extra items, not on the list.

Even though I was polite and conversational, she still meekly stated that she will talk to someone higher up to make the changes I suggested.  

I think we're going to have our good breakfast back. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [The Big Bang Theory] How to give the show an awesome sendoff. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-03 17:08:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't know if this will happen, but this would be the best end that I can think of. The show has been signed for another three years, and this will assume it ends at that timeframe.

Over the course of the show, Penny has shown herself to be more and more interested in nerd culture and science thanks to Leonard and the gang. During the next two seasons, this interest can blossom into a full passion, leading to the second year finale, where she asks Leonard and Sheldon to help her start a show to make science more interesting to normal children, like Bill Nye or Professor Proton.

The third, and final, season of the show has her working with everyone to make the show-within-a-show, with her as the host and relating scientific concepts in a friendly manner, scripted by Bernadette and Raj.

The penultimate episode ends with Penny getting a call from Dr. Gablehauser, offering her an honorary doctorate for her work. In the last episode, Howard acts all steamed for a bit before getting over the fact that Penny gets to be called Doctor before he does. This also serves as a way of finally revealing her last name, which was carefully guarded over the series run. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Much shorter than my last rants.

Indian student comes into the lobby, asks if we are hiring and who the manager is. I offered my Indian boss's pseudonym "Bill" and proceed to hand him an application, like I do for any other person looking for a job.

 Do I have to fill out the application? I want a job under the table.

I look to him with a straight face, then to the line of customers behind him, and tell him that he does, and that it is illegal to be paid under the table for work. (I don't normally go that far, but I didn't want the guests to have the impression that we hire like that, even though my stupid boss does)

He persists for a minute, and ultimately leaves without filling out the application at all.

Guest walks up to the counter with a laugh, and I tell him the funniest part. If Bill wanted to hire him under the table after he filled out an application,  he could simply throw it away afterwards.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's Spring Break here, in a coastal town, to give you the background on this reservation.

Semi - regular guest comes in at 8, 9 in the morning and asks for a room right away. I explain to him that the room is not ready yet, as we had a full house, but I get him reserved for the night so he doesn't have to worry. 

He calls over and over again throughout the morning, asking for the room to be ready, parking in the back and bugging the different housekeepers, and generally being impatient. I tell him specifically not to bother housekeeping while he is waiting for his room.

2 o'clock rolls around, and he comes up to the desk again. I tell him that they haven't let me know yet, and that if I didn't know by the time my relief arrived at 3, I would find out for him.

He says okay, and walks off toward the back, then goes to one of the housekeepers and convinces him to let them into a room (that wasn't even the room assigned to him), saying that I told him it was okay.

I wouldn't even have known about it if the housekeeper hadn't thought to tell me after. I told them to leave. Period. We are busy enough that we will rerent the room, no problem. 

Turns out the housekeepers know that he was dealing drugs from the room during previous stays.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simple story, constantly repeated in any hotel setting.

Guest makes their reservation through ThatOneInternetSiteWeKnow.com (fake name if that is actually a domain out there) and gets the room to arrive on Friday. She calls me afterwards to make sure everything is good.

Friday comes around and she calls back, saying that she will be coming later than expected. Again, no big deal. I note that she will arrive late.

By the night audit, she still hadn't shown up, but I left the note, so the NA checked the room in.

Guest arrives at 3PM, Saturday, and asks for her reservation. The poor Indian student (I was off) at the desk is temporarily confused by the missing reservation, as it was no longer reserved. It was In House.

Guest calls TOISWK, who calls the desk and assists him in finding the room. Problem solved, right? 

Wrong. 

She comes in this morning,  Monday, to make sure she was credited for the stay Friday night, saying that the person who had trouble finding her room told her she'd be refunded.

So, I told her calmly, carefully, that we can not credit her back for any reason on a third-party booking, as we did not charge her. I also explained to her that despite any difficulty in finding the reservation, it was in the computer the whole night and that the room was not rerented in any way. But i told her that if she wishes to dispute the charges, she must do so with TOISWK. 

She calls them, who calls me asking to refund, and I reiterate that we will not refund. The room was in house on Friday and was held for her to check in at any time. We also would have had to turn guests away, as it is Spring Break (not that you can tell from the weather).

Guest comes back to the lobby, TOISWK on the phone in her ear, and demands that I grant permission.

Now, at this point, I am stonewalling. I apologized for any mistakes or misinformation that may have been given, but I would not give in and remove the night's charge. I also refused to call the manager out from the more important things he was doing, as I know he doesn't like dealing with people. 

After the guest leaves in a huff to call corporate to try and get a refund, I bring the information to the manager so he knows what is going on.

Lo and behold, he was *there* when the FD looked for the reservation and he most definitely did not offer any sort of credit or refund. He told me that if she came back, he would talk to her, but she simply left the building. 

TL;dr Entitled self - important guest thinks she can dictate our refund policies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lady comes into the office, kids in tow, her husband starts making a baby bottle on my counter, and she interrupts my interaction with the person in front of her.

I make her wait the half a minute it takes to tell my guest where to go, and get her information and she decides to take a room. So far, so good, though she told me that she was going to be the only adult, when I see her husband right there. The kids aren't old enough, so it doesn't change the rate anyway.

She pulls out an absolutely mangled ID. It's been cut into pieces and taped back together, with the ID number, name, and photo on three different pieces. Huge red flags in my head already, with her trying to rush me and then the questionable ID. And then I see my out.

The piece that has the ID number also has an expiration date of two weeks ago. I told her I couldn't rent to her with an invalid ID.

Edit: Part 2!

She comes back in, her children in tow, and brings along someone else with a valid ID. We start getting her signed in and I ask for payment, and get the response, "Oh! She didn't pay you yet?"

Nope. She didn't. I give them the price and they make a huge deal getting out the money, hand me the money, then change their mind about staying.

I didn't even have to be an asshole that time,  and they left. 

My guess is that they were hoping I'd have forgotten about the fact that I didn't charge them for not taking the room.  </TEXT>

Would you, as shoppers, be willing to pay a higher shipping cost upfront, and receive a coupon or gift certificate for the difference in return? Doing so, you would have an incentive to return to the shop, and I, as the seller, don't lose money on shipping fees.

Thoughts? Questions? Heated calls for me to go to a different subreddit? I'm up for all of it. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-01-18 17:30:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edits, added info on Key to Laughter. refined info on what the Keys are.

Throughout the season, we have been trying to find the different keys to open the chest, and each episode has been given a strange hook at the end.

I believe that some of these ending *are* the keys to unlock that chest. Specifically, the shining items. The items themselves will be revealed to become the keys once all of them are found.

The Key to Generosity - Rainbow Thread - The key to Generosity is not to give away without thought. You must be willing to see when your generosity is harming others, and be careful not to hurt your relationships.

The Key to Loyalty - Wonderbolt's Badge - The key to Loyalty is to stick with your friends, even if it means giving up something important to you.

The Key to Laughter - Boneless -  The key to Laughter is knowing when to be light-hearted and when to be serious. If they pony you are throwing the party for isn't having fun, then you are doing something wrong.

The others have not been seen yet, but will show themselves in the next few episodes. Each Key will be a mostly ordinary item that is germane to the episode. Each Key will be given by the pony that learned a lesson about the Element, and will representative of both their and the Bearer's personality.

The Key to Kindness - The key to Kindness is to know when that kindness is being wasted. You can still be polite to those that are rude to you, but you must know when to walk away. (Fluttershy's episode will likely involve a conflict between her animals.)

The Key to Honesty - The key to Honesty is to not be afraid to face the truth, no matter how unpleasant. It is one thing to tell a white lie about liking someone's dress, but hiding the truth will generally lead to disaster. (Applejack's episode has been brewing for a long time now, and things will quickly come to a head soon)

The Key to Friendship - The key to Friendship is to love your friends during the best and worst of times. Even when you are angry with them, even when you are sick, even when they do wrong. (Twilight's episode will involve Discord, and will end with the opening of the chest. Twilight will make the revelation that she does not want to harm Discord, because he is still a friend. She will also learn that Chaos, the Element he embodies, is a necessary force in the universe.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Victor Tate, arrested and convicted for a crime he didn't commit, serves 18 years hard time when Stabler and Benson find the real perp. Perp confesses, but is killed before he can give his plea in open court.

So, why can't they have Tate released in the interest of justice. Certainly, the testimony of the arresting officer saying that Tate is innocent, based on the admission of guilt from the deceased would be enough for a parole board to consider early release, or the governor to grant a pardon.

Hell, Liv and El have friends in the media, if the Governor said no, They could drum up public support.

There is no reason, legally, to keep him in prison. </TEXT>

So, what are these Keys, and where are they found?

1) Key of Honesty

2) Key of Kindness

3) Key of Laughter

4) Key of Loyalty

5) Key of Generosity

6) Key of Magic

And the final question, What is in the box?

<TEXT> ...is when guests accuse me of being racist because I didn't give them everything they wanted.

This guy just now felt like he could check out whenever he personally felt like it because he didn't get into the room early yesterday. Mind you, it easy a busy day that morning, no one was being checked in when he originally came, because none of the rooms were clean. Our normal check in time is 3pm, so all guests that came early were told to come back after three.

We get some rooms ready early (about 2pm), and so we begin checking people in, provided their room was ready, and when my relief came in at 3, I personally got a list of all the rooms that were ready from the housekeepers to start checking people in more quickly.

This morning, after checking out, this jackass accuses me of checking people in with 'preferential treatment' which confused me for a moment until he continued, "I'm sure you only checked white people in early".

That was it for me, after all the nastiness he was spewing that I normally let wash over me (he'd been demanding a late check out for over an hour), I cut him off.

"Don't make this about race, that isn't fair to me and it isn't fair to you."

His response, "No, it's not fair to me."

<TITLE> Compound theories regarding Equestria Girls and the Element of Harmony. (xpost /r/TheoryofPony) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-25 00:40:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In an effort to make sens of the slightly contrived ending, I noticed three important things regarding the Element of Harmony stolen by Sunset Shimmer.

First, that the stolen Element is not the Element of Magic wielded by Twilight Sparkle. Upon her ascension at the end of the third season, the power of the other five Elements merged with the one embedded in the crown to created a single Element.

Second, the people of Canterlot High and the ponies of Equestria are causally linked to one another. While they have different experiences and memories, they each hold the same personalities, abilities, and relationships as their counterparts. Because of this, when Pony!Fluttershy earned the Element of Kindness, Human!Fluttershy was able to wield its power as well. It should be noted that when Twilight's transformation occurred, the other Elements remained intact.

Third, and most important, is that Sunset Shimmer had no way of knowing these previous points. She believed that bringing the Element of Harmony into the human world would give her the power of the Elements in the human world, where she could gather an army to take over Equestria.

*But...*

She had been living in Canterlot High for 2 and a half years. She had to have known that there was no magic working there. So, why would she believe that bringing the crown there would be a worthwhile endeavor? Why not just put the crown on inside the Crystal Empire?

The answer can only be one thing. The Nightmare Force.

For over a thousand years, something has been corrupting powerful individuals in Equestria, and turning them into cruel and evil beings. This force had been defeated by the Elements of Harmony before, possibly twice, depending on when Sunset Shimmer left Equestria, and it may have taken root inside Sunset Shimmer as well.

If it was whispering to her to take the crown away from Equestria, it may have believed that it could take over the Element in the Human World. When Twilight wears the crown before Sunset Shimmer, nothing happens, and when Sunset puts the crown on, she babbles about unlimited power, but the magic takes hold on its own. A Dark Magic, separate from the aura she displayed in the Crystal Empire. The transformation was not caused because Sunset wore the crown. It was because Nightmare did.

Season 4 will be exploring this Nightmare Force in more detail, and the events of this movie may or may not play out with that, but they seem linked.

<DATE> 2013-07-19 03:17:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On another sub, the discussion regarding the Labor Theory of Value naturally lead here. Among questions that I have to ask is that if, as the one self-described socialist in the discussion suggested, we as a society were to disallow earnings on capital investment, including giving some of the company's profit to shareholders, what would be used to give investments to new companies?

To be more simple in my phrasing, if I had a sum of money saved up from working, what incentive do I have to loan that money to my neighbor, who wants to make useful products for others?

If I were to give a loan for zero interest, I run all the risk of loss, and have no potential to gain, therefore my only way of gaining is to only utilize my money for my own projects, because I would be a worker and not an investor.

Does this not breed more selfishness? Ironically, the philosophy of selfishness, Objectivism, would encourage investment in others with appropriate thought and care to minimize loss, leading (hopefully) to a better business venture.

I appreciate your taking the time to read this, and would further appreciate an honest answer as to how my thinking is not in line with your philosophy, so I may better understand. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-04-19 17:08:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am going to begin acting as an SLL gateway. If you wish to use ripple to trade SLL (Second Life Lindens) for BTC or USD for a much lower fee than ViwWoX, I can help.

1) Trust my ripple account ( rwJvwvXz7Tg4KNP29yzqQnciFFL1YCpKUH ) for any arbitrarily large amount of the currency "SLL", you will have to enter that in manually.

2) Connect your account to the Bitstamp gateway for USD and BTC.

3) If you wish to buy SLL, put in a trade, typing in "SLL/BTC" or "SLL/USD" select my address for the SLL issuer, and bitstamp for the other. Liquidity will be initially low, so do not worry about the speed of the trade. It will become faster as trades continue.

4) If you wish to sell SLL, PM me either here on Reddit or on Second Life (train_subject9260.resident), to send the Ripple payment address and set up a time to give the SLL collateral. This amount, minus the 1% deposit fee, will be sent as a Ripple payment immediately on receipt. You may then Sell SLL for USD or BTC using the same method in 3).

5) To withdraw your funds from Ripple in SLL, contact me with your SL username, and the amount you will withdraw. I will give you a transaction number for the payment and send the funds to you for no additional fees.

6) To withdraw in USD or BTC, use the methods described in Bitstamp. Some fees may apply.

Fees collected from this will be used as follows.

1) Upgrading to a premium account to allow land purchase.

2) To buy a plot of land to allow "Face to Face" transactions between Ripplers, allowing for a soft marketplace for buying or selling products for currencies other than SLL.

3) To expand that land to allow for static shops, which will increase SLL holdings within Ripple and facilitate larger trades.

4) To expand into a social gathering point focusing on the Bitcoin and Ripple communities in SL. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who holds the money while it is in ripple? If I set up a gateway, would I be able to take money from my friend, for example, and send him a payment in Ripple?

Would I simply be in possession of his money at that time?

How would I be informed if another gateway withdraws that IOU, so I can send them the money, if necessary?

 And what would stop me from setting my own price to trade from one currency to another? And from that, trade with myself for a higher or lower price than a normal exchange. </TEXT>

"Lima Bean" - Play when you would be affected by a monster's Bad Stuff that includes Death. You survive instead and gain levels as if you defeated the monster. This can not give you the winning level. No Treasure is gained.

"Reincarnation" - Play when someone would be affected by a monster's Bad Stuff that includes Death. ~~Roll a die. On 4-6,~~ you reincarnate as a member of the opposite sex. Discard all Race/Class/Etc. Cards and replace with the same number starting from the bottom of the Discard Pile.

"Weighted Boots" - -5 Power, -1 Run Away, Every combat you successfully Run Away from while wearing the Boots add add a +1 counter (+2 for Martial Artists) to yourself that is lost on Death., Footwear, Big, 300 Gold

"Neo**nic Nightmare" - -1 Power, Scientific Experiment combines your DNA with a Spider, -4 Arms, No Value

Edit - Removed dice roll from Reincarnation.

Edit - Fix to the Boots </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are a total of over $100,000 in USD loan requests on the site, which are used to buy BTC on margin, some of the requests as high as 150% interest.

Because Margin buying is done as a loan, where the buyer can not retrieve the coins, they are purely speculative purchases, and indicate an extreme inflation to the price of the coins themselves.

This is great news for people who are lending money, as the system will not allow the borrowers to default, but this could pose a serious risk to newer purchasers of BTC. If these margin loans were to close position quickly, it would burn through the buy orders and plummet the exchange rate.

Eventually, these loans will close, no matter what. The only question is, will the sellers leave slowly, keeping the price high, or will they dump? </TEXT>

I have already created a basic version, but to get full functionality, including the ability to place ads for the guests to view and social networking, it will cost a total of $5,000.

With 6 months until the convention, and regular updates as new information and guests are provided, this can present and opportunity for a great amount of viewer impressions, and higher potential returns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My credit was shot to hell (low-500s), with two bank accounts, a credit card, and two cell phone accounts unpaid. A couple years ago, i took a shot in the dark and opened an account at Bank of America so i could cash my paychecks for free. That got me into Merrill Edge for stock trading, which is doing well but still low. Then I saw Credit Karma on the web, and found out exactly how to clear my credit scores. 

Thanks to careful planning I have a score over 600, and heading up. I got approved for two credit cards, one a secured card from Capitol One and the other (just recently) an unsecured, no-annual fee, NFL Rewards card, and a line of credit at Fingerhut (I know, they're overpriced there, but it is okay). 

With Fingerhut, I'll buy one overpriced crap item at a time, and pay it off over time, leaving a huge portion of credit unused. I will save more by not constantly buying stuff from them then I would be spending in interest.

By my birthday, I might be in the top 50% of all credit scores in the country, and it would only go up from there! </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the bright side, there is little worry for fraudulent transactions as a seller when accepting bitcoin. Plus, as the value goes up, the coins that I have banked become more valuable.

But on the other hand, because there is a finite amount of coins to be mined and created, those who start early with bitcoin are likely to gain a rather unfair advantage monetarily. If I buy just one bitcoin, and it becomes a global currency, then i would be one of the richest men in the world. (21,000,000 BTC/7 billion people =0.003 BTC/person average)

If my assessment is wrong, i would love to know why and how. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dear Mr. President,

 I am writing today as a self-appointed representative of Objectivism to discuss the budget concerns hounding our country. We have spent ourselves into a hole that many of us worry will never be gotten out of, and we can all agree that steps must be taken now to prevent our great nation from going the way of others.

The first and foremost thing we must do to stem this impending disaster is to cut spending. Cut to the bone. Cut until it hurts. Anywhere that money is wasted, that liars and cheats get what they do not deserve, or that people fall into a lull of safety at the gifts of government must be removed from our budget. And cut until the cost of finding more waste, fraud, and abuse is not worth finding anymore.

Put back the work requirements for welfare. Lower the allowable weeks of being on unemployment. Stop federal contractors from overbilling for everything they manufacture. Pass budget laws that allow only directly related amendments to bills. 

At the same time, cut and limit loopholes and deductions in the tax law to prevent cheats from paying lower than they need. Do not demonise the rich as a group, as it is the rich that do so much for our nation, but go after those who utilize the law to circumvent their true fair share.

And then, only after there is nothing left to cut, after nothing else can be removed from spending, after no more waste or fraud are visibly present, do you consider raising the tax rates. The rich, and those who wish to be rich, want nothing more than to see our nation prosper, and if there was absolutely no choice but to raise rates on any level, we would gladly give.

However, when a large portion of our population gets more back from the government than they give, and with spending so high and only climbing higher, we must conclude that there are other methods to bring down our deficit to a manageable level. We, as a country, make so much that we could do anything we wanted, if we were not burdened with this crippling debt.

That brings me to my last point of advice, when we get the budget down, and we have a surplus, do not under any circumstances release it as a rebate to the people. Use it to further pay off the debt, and lower the burden for future years. Once that debt is paid off, we could lower taxes across the board with impunity. </TEXT>

Mind you, I am not calling him a hippie because he was a socialist, Occupy member, I called him that because he stank to high heaven, hitchhiked from Maine to Texas with his girlfriend and dog (he claims it is a service dog, but I think it was just to get around "No Pets" policies), and was wearing tie-dyed clothes, and a rastafarian hat and natty dredds.

<DATE> 2012-10-20 03:11:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I bought a copy of Ultimate Spider-Man #160 last week, the one with the blank cover. The anime convention I was attending had Sam de la Rosa, and he offered (for a fee) to hand-draw a sketch of Venom, Carnage, and Spider-Man on the cover and sign it.

This is the first time I had the opportunity to buy a comic of this caliber, and so I dropped the money without hesitation. Only after I received the comic (the next day from Sam, who took pictures of the work for his archives) and talked with a friend in art appraisal, did I look up the rules regarding signed comics.

They won't appraise a signed comic and certify the autograph unless they **actually** witness the signing. No exceptions! So, now I'm stuck with an ungraded comic, and if I send it to grade, they'll likely mark points off for the fact that the cover is drawn on.

So, I got to thinking, what if there was competition to the CGC in regard to grading comics? 

CGC charges an absolute minimum of $18 per comic, and that is only for modern age comics that appraise for less that $200. And they require a minimum of 20-30 comics to be submitted at once.

I could get away with $10 plus 3% of appraisal for any comic, giving a hard plastic case as part of the deal. Plus, the grading would be able to be performed by someone that cares about the details like signatures, and can take providence into account. In fact, I'd want to get signed copies, as it increases the value and the price of the appraisal.

Obviously, I wouldn't want to start such a service without support, so reply if you would be interested in an Independent Appraisal of your collectibles.

TL;dr - The CGC is too expensive for smaller collectors, let's make our own service. </TEXT>
