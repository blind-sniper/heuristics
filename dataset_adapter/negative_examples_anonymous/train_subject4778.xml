<TEXT> My mom suffers from migraine, it started just having it once a month, then once a week, then more, and now she has it every two days. And when she has it, she's laying in bed for at least day.

Just two weeks ago she hit rock bottom and took a bunch of pills because she just couldnt take it anymore... she literally has no life. I'm super happy that she woke my dad up because she regretted doing it. They went to the hospital and pumped her stomach. I am still fuming with anger. It just feels so weird that she made that decision and i want to help her but i cant stop being mad at her. Event though i know i'm not helping her with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aah i know this zoo, its in Rotterdam. The glasses say "Bokito kijker" (Bokito Watcher). Bokito is the name of a gorilla that escaped back in 2007 i guess. Some lady visited the zoo almost 4 times a week and thought that she bonded with the gorilla. But what she didn't know was that she was making eye contact and seeking for attention, which the gorilla sees as agressive behaviour. 

When Bokito escaped he went straight for the lady, dragged her through the zoo and bit her hundreds of times. 

In this video you can see the lady interact with Bokito and some images of the escape (mind you, its all in Dutch).

And did they actually use the original Bolg in that scene where Gandalf was in that cage?

I'm showering, grabbing my bag for work, i'm fully clothed, i'm almost ready to go make breakfast. While i'm grabbing my phone for a quick look. THATS when i realize its 2 in the fucking morning and i can sleep for at least 4,5 hours before my alarm goes off...

<TEXT> Look for Qlimax 2014, happened last weekend. Hardstyle maybe is a bit unknown in a very big part of the world. But its growing, and the shows they give in the stadiums are crazy. Lots of indoor fireworks.

<TEXT> yep you could say he is, its a show that likes stirring up discussions. They are standing at a building where inside they are talking about the whole discussion, and the people outside are there to support the anti-zwarte piet cause. But maybe it helps to know that some people would freak out just by seeing the pink mic because of their reputation. The people that are anti-zwarte piet are already assuming that he is going to ask weird questions to get cheap laughs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well not really, there is a huge discussion going on in the Netherlands about this tradition. This video is made so we (people in the Netherlands) can see how people from a different country react to a tradition thats so normal to us Dutchies. I guess you can say that some people from the Netherlands will find it "intolerant" to say 'Zwarte Piet' is racism. But nevertheless its very refreshing to see the pure shocked and angry reactions to the blackface and the other portrayals of 'Zwarte Piet'. (Black Pete) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Daniel, thank you so much for doing this AMA. Been a HP fan for as long as i can remember and you've portrayed him perfectly as i had envisioned him reading the books. My question: I can understand that you and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson grew very close during the filming of all the movies, but what was your first impression of Rupert and Emma?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the same thing is happening in de Achterhoek, all the young people are leaving for the 'big city' but still there are a lot of Graafschap and Vitesse supporters. Its just weird that there has never developed at least a Jupiler League worthy club which people could root for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Pieter, thank you for doing the AMA, i really enjoyed your set at Defqon, looking forward to the album!!

question number 1: i always admire that you have a lot of contact with the community/your fans, why is it so important for you to stay close to your fans?

2: what was the most epic gig you've played?

3: is there ever going to be a collab with Degos   Re-done? i've seen you guys together on stage, and i always thought it was a shame that you guys haven't been in the studio together (as far as i know)

again, thanks for doing this AMA, keep up the good work :D
