<TEXT> I'll actually put the first one ahead of dredd as the ultimate indicator of how stupid the average fanboy is.

When a film makes that shitty godzilla reboot look good you know you've done something wrong.

Weak ass premise. Shitty stock characters. Contrived love story (but not really, daddy issues). Awful dialogue. The acting was so fucking bad even the good actors were uncomfortable.

What a piece of shit.

And it somehow made enough to warrant another?

or something like that

but there is no one way

there is a writer/director on the front of reddit now who mentions some stuff

or go spend time on /r/screenwriting and read posts

but thinking it is just about writing a couple of scripts you think are good and just sending them to the head honchos and getting green lit is tremendously naive 

the fucking writing itself seems a fairly minor point overall

I'll even explain it to you, which I shouldn't, because you are being rude.

I never said the people making the jokes spoke for all americans as you suggested

I never once mentioned it

I never once mentioned the twitter jokes 

All I said was, as you cut and pasted, "Americans are bad winners and sore losers."

That was it.

So there it is as clear as day. There is no trolling, no attempts to disguise my comments or change them in anyway, that is it, quite clearly. </TEXT>

No I did not insult you off the bat - you sure you got the right user? Care to point that out?

I'll skip the middle part because it's just circlejerk stuff.

 I'm aware that I might cause you a whole lot of butthurt by asking you this, but why won't you just explain it?

Why would it cause me 'butthurt'?

Bizarre comment.

Why won't I explain it? 

As of now - because I don't believe you don't understand it. It would mean you are probably the only person on the thread who didn't get it (watch as people come out of the woodwork now).

Note: Try as you might what you wrote in the end was undoubtedly cringe material. Not le cringe, or anything like that, no, just clear cringe.

 It's basically become accepted fact by now.

Ow.

 Again, if you don't ever want to explain yourself that's fine, but when you refuse you better have some tissues handy, because you are going to be downvoted.

Oh no!

No your comment is wrong. It doesn't matter how much you explain yourself. I've said this dozens of times on reddit. [I found one of my drunken rants about it too](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2odqj4/the_sorry_cynical_state_of_movie_fandom_today/cmm6hq1)

Yes you are demanding, you are still demanding. You are trying to be superior and claim that you don't understand how my succinct (heh) response actually encompasses the main faults with the film in the eyes of the detractors.

It's hysterical.

Just admit you know exactly what I mean by that sentence. It's so simple. 

 Look buddy, we all know you can't explain that nonsense you typed out initially. It's basically become accepted fact by now.

Cringe.

I'll excuse your post pao insults and be the bigger man.

I've written in tremendous detail about the concept of opinions on /r/movies, trust me you are adding nothing to it.

Your comment about the upvotes is just wrong. No matter the detail of the response you are not in any way more likely to get upvoted. 

And back to the main:

Your lack of understanding of the phrase is really painful to read. And if you genuinely believe I am incapable of explaining why that short sentence perfectly sums up why many regarded the film Fury Road as overrated then I don't know what to say.

A fucking infant could.

I choose not to. As I already explained, just because some fanboy demands it doesn't mean you have to do shit.

But if you do, because you will just get downvoted or ignored anyway, save your energy and always be succinct.

<TEXT> Well it's unfortunately a fact of being on a default sub where the hivemind (which does exist as we have seen the last few days) latches onto certain things (QT, Nolan, McCon) and basically does not allow any dissenting opinion, no matter how much it is backed up.

This came up yesterday as well. And easily thousands of times before. I even wrote lengthy rants about it in the past

But just ignore the reality and throw in the term 'cute' and maybe that will make it all better. 



Sigh.

That I am right, without a doubt.

Neither. But to say you are not a fanboy is hysterical. You obviously are.

 , he's done very little work, producing semi-good super profitable family comedies, while being a family man first.

Seems to work a bit, his films are shit and many of them are not that profitable (he has some ridiculous deal or something IIRC) and who gives a shit about being a family man.

<TEXT>  Yep, and I explained why not giving answers is stupid, damaging, and childlike.

No you didn't. Simple opinions are perfectly valid in many contexts. It's never about the simple opinion.

And yes I did explain quite succinctly the general reasons why people think the film is overrated - it just have went over your head.

Which is disturbing because it was quite simple.

And as for your last paragraph - oh christ it's like you never come to /r/movies at all. Yeah I upvoted him when he was in the negatives, some others did too, wow, it discounts nothing since the other 10000 posts doing the same didn't.

Don't make me fucking laugh.

But back to the main issue - you don't see how it is succinct? 

Really?

Be honest, not just internet argument (which unfortunately once again you really think you are right about this, and that I am wrong, which is just fucking disturbing), be honest - you don't understand how that response is succinct?

I just told you why I don't normally give answers.

 it's just unnecessarily cryptic

No it isn't. It's pretty succinct. 

 So yea, if you don't feel like explaining why you disliked a movie that's fine,

I repeat this - I never said one way of the other

 but you add absolutely nothing to the discussion by doing so.

Except I explained why some people don't like it.

 If all you care about is wether you get upvoted or downvoted for your comment, then don't even bother commenting in the first place.

Really? This is all you got now?

Hysterical.

In fact I rarely respond to users demanding to know the reason why someone disliked their precious, I think it is fucking shitty behaviour, every time a film the hive likes is treated negatively it gets downvoted - even when explained in detail etc. 

Yet if I was to write 'Fury Road is awesome' I'd get 200 upvotes.

<TEXT> It really doesn't. It's pretty much identical to the rest of reddit. 

 There seem to be a lot of people here who only go on /r/soccer and one or two other subreddits, avoiding the defaults entirely.

That is not unique. 

I know what it is about.

 If the /r/soccer mods don't share those grievances then why would they shut it down?

Already explained several times. Solidarity, make the voice of the admins across reddit heard, and as it seems as this thing expands a bit the users who are obviously pissed as well.

Burying head in the sand is all this is.

And I am not even talking about fully dark, just 12 hours, or even allow discussion about it instead of yanking posts.

I gave a coherent polite response, he basically in our conversation has now tried to dismiss it twice, ignored it when I responded to his concerns (had to do it again and repeatedly ask him if there were any more), and failed to bring up any relevant points

then I  watched as the conversation lead to a fixation on the word 'junk', to some attempt at entering a philosophical convo about the nature of knowing, and then onto the easy dismissal of both of us being too tired.

Yes, I already explained this.

 The posts which go against the hive for example will still be visible without having to click anything, not get downvoted into negatives, which hides them, and if a low karma user can subject them to that delay in posting.

I already said this.

But again, it's got nothing to do with my ideas about removing downvotes.

  I wrote a lengthy reply there.

The long response? Yeah it doesn't address my points at all.

 I wouldn't call it "criticism" as I haven't heard of a single decent proposed alternative. Without a suggestion, it's not criticism, it's just (to put it bluntly) whining.

I gave you one, showed how it works, showed the benefits, and answered your concerns.

I am more concerned with the negatives, take /r/movies for example, go and give a 200 word post about how you think QT is shallow and you will get downvoted, an innocuous comment about Marvel will get you downvoted etc

 I suppose part of my issue is that removing downvotes means we can't downvote these things to help get actual commentary to the top, but that's already not happening.

<TEXT> Do I trust the mods. Statistically, over the hive, I would say yes.

I have mentioned a true appeal system on reddit before. I'd love to see one in place. 

 And to what end? What's really bad about the current system? All you provided was the adjective "junk".

What is wrong is that perfectly fine opinions are constantly getting downvoted because the hive disagrees with them.

In essence, using your terminology, they are being 'punished' for expressing their genuine opinion, because the hive does not agree with their POV.

We are not talking about anything offensive or anything like that, just a genuine opinion expressed cleanly - that is what I am talking about.

But I've already said that as well. So I am confused as to why you accused me of just saying 'junk'.

I think my point has been quite clear from the start. Removing downvotes so that peoples genuine opinions which go against the hive remain and are not 'punished' by the hive.

It happens, what can we do about it - that's what we are talking about.

Put that aside, it really is not the issue.

I cannot truly know why another person does anything.

but - I do know that plenty of perfectly sound opinions are downvoted in certain threads as they go against the hive.

That's all I can work with.

Mods - that is their job, and they can get more if needed, already addressed that.

" If more mods are needed get them, it's not a paid position, plenty of willing people."

Yeah downvotes used as punishments... eh, yeah back to my original point -

"The reddit hive cannot be trusted to act reasonably, especially not about emotive topics."

No I didn't.

Never once approached it.

 and you refuse to acknowledge there might be downsides to your proposal?

There aren't. 

All it does is allow everyone the equal voice of 1 upvote and no downvoted into negatives which hide the comment and if you are a newish user start the ridiculous delay process which prevents you from posting often.

Any site rule breaking content will be reported and removed by mods. If more mods are needed get them, it's not a paid position, plenty of willing people. In fact the inability to downvote certain comments in a thread could lead to them being ignored more often, as many people go to the negatives first to read the nasty comments.

There are absolutely no negatives in my idea.

If you can think of one I'd love to hear it.

<TEXT> So right. These interchangeable directors, who are they? I check their IMDBs and barely recognise things until boom they got a huge film. 

So I go check above. Oh yeah he did that film 20 years ago which was okay. Then some crap and tv and then he got thor. 

Are the studios so confident they don't require anyone with a vision because of their involvement? Do they just get a blank slate to come in and direct their product? Because that is what it feels like.

The scripts are just well I dunno. 

Jurassic World was the same. The Avengers is getting there.

The funny thing is when you see some technowarrior on here laugh at newspapers closing I just shake my head.

I admire wikileaks but it is not going to be able to do what the time or the guardian does.

You complain about tv news being shit - go out and vote with your wallet. Subscribe to X Y and Z. Get an international, one more local, one magazine with commentary. Digital or paper. 

Money where mouth is.

These stations have sponsors, loads of money, they pander to the dumb masses.

You want good journalism, pick up a paper.

Otherwise - and this goes to 99% of users on reddit who complain about this - just shut up.

<TEXT> Hyperbole but I understand the point he is trying to make.

 And if he did that today he'd probably be criticized for it, the way the Godzilla director was criticized for not showing Godzilla early enough.

If the 2nd half of that Godzilla film was actually good it wouldn't have mattered. People wanted godzilla because they were bored shitless staring at one of the most blank and charmless actors that hollywood has now decided to add to the roster of young talent.

 A summer blockbuster isn't going for Oscars? What a fucking shock!

  I just think its pretty hilarious given that JW is breaking a lot of money-making records, so I'm sure the studio is SO SAD when you criticize the movie

Shame on some people for wanting to discuss the movie despite its financial success or what the studio thinks, shame.

 Also, you editorialized the headline in this post, which is kind of bad form.

<TEXT> Inoffensive is rather a harsh term in my book. 

Some films = entertainment, sure I get it, but when something is so lifeless and slapped together makes you wonder who is at fault here?

People bitching about the lack of original movies don't go see original movies (fuck sake they think mad max and dredd are somehow original)

Movie making by numbers. A computer could write the script, hit the beats, put in the awful dialogue and away you go. 

Which is fine when it makes money.

But it is like they sometimes don't think they need to try anymore. Just tie it together and push it out. 

Outside of the animation people and the score there was zero artistry in that movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh,

 I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings

I just explained that point, in the very sentence you pasted. Are you serious? You actually answered your post for me. How everyones knows about the new ways to do those things, but it doesn't change the reality about earnings.

Which was the topic.

  The only way musicians are going to have a chance at making real money from their music is if we do away with record companies, which is what the internet is doing.

And again I said it wasn't, all it did was open the gates and allow millions to scramble for the meagres. No *real* money involved. Only the lucky few will get anything, much like the system with labels.

Again, would you like to come back to the topic on hand and address that?

<TEXT> Way to address nothing there. 

I say again the internet has changed nothing in practical monetary earning terms, it just opened the pool to everyone.

 We are not talking about the new ability to distribute, advertise etc etc, I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings, but of course you brought it up as some proof how right you are, baffling

I'd ask you to actually argue but I don't think you want to. The fact you really do think you are right is insane to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are talking about the internet changing things, dumping labels and allowing artists to earn money.

You go off on a tangent which is irrelevant to the fact that all it has done it made a level playing field for millions, and so with everyone scrambling for money few earn, the exact same way it is now.

Do you understand? 

 , so that's somehow a bad thing? 

Course it is. Most musicians will fucking tell you this. A saturated market is now just fucked.

Deals, beiber, money - yawn - heard it all before. Nothing you say is new. I can't stress this enough.

<TEXT>  The film begins with a continuous four-minute take that starts on a television screen showing a Hindi soap opera and pulls out into the street, where armed gangs are furiously searching for a man, gunning down anyone in their path who might be his ally. They bomb his house. When the pressure becomes too much to bear, there is a cut, and with it, an exhale. But there is no loss of tension. The film powers forward, relentless, for the next five hours.

Sounds pretty amazing. </TEXT>
