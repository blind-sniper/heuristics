<TEXT> Here's the mod reply I got when I asked why it was being censored: 

from hoosakiwi[M] via /r/politics/ sent 45 minutes ago
"The entire post is about a private citizen and his statements about Obama. More than half of it is about the personal life of that private citizen (Mr. Guiliani). It is not explicitly political and at best could be seen as a gossip article."

Here is my reply to the mod: 

Mr Giuliani is a public figure. He is still referred to as "Mayor Giuliani" and he tried to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. He made the remarks about Obama's lack of love of country in a speech to a political gathering, and the remarks were widely reported by the media. If Giuliani wants to be regarded as a private citizen, maybe he should not speak at political gatherings about political figures, then follow up by talking to the press about it.
In addition, all of the facts in the article you censored are a matter of public record.
Do the mods have a system of checks and balances or is one mod's decision final? This is pretty clearly an attempt to shield Giuliani.
P.S. Learn to spell the name of the "private citizen" you're trying to protect.

<TEXT> People in Montana aren't required to get malaria shots because unless they leave the country they don't get malaria. You include a quote saying that epidemiological studies show that Hep B can be transmitted in daycare. It can also be transmitted from pregnant women to their children, or from close contact in the home.

Hep B in its chronic stage can be symptom-free and can go undetected for decades. Has every parent and daycare worker been tested for it?The Hep B vaccine is safe. It gives immunity for 20-30 years and possibly for life. The consequences of getting the disease are extremely serious. Risk-benefit analysis would seem to indicate that the Hep B vaccinations are a reasonable solution to a threat to public health.

<TEXT> None of the situations you mention is the same as needlessly spreading a very communicable disease to a vulnerable population such as infants or the immunocompromised. The line should actually be drawn not at smoking outside in my vicinity, or at coughing or having the flu, but at putting others at risk of catching an extremely contagious disease that can bring serious complications or even death to vulnerable individuals -- a disease that would be virtually nonexistent in this country if people would resume vaccination at the rate they vaccinated 15 years ago.

Vaccinations -- and the isolation of those with communicable illnesses -- are not a new idea. Ever hear of leper colonies? Modern medicine has come up with vaccinations, so isolation is not needed much anymore -- unless you refuse to partake, and in that case civil society has the right to protect its members from preventable risks. Here's an article about the legal history of compelling vaccinations in our country from the current online Atlantic:

<TEXT> @Fuzzymuscles -- Infants under one year of age are too young to be vaccinated. People who have compromised immune systems, like those who are getting chemotherapy for cancer, can't get vaccinations either. 

These groups depend on "herd immunity," which is produced when a high percentage of the general public is vaccinated. If more than 95% of a community is vaccinated, the unvaccinated people are very unlikely to be exposed to the disease. 

So by having your kids vaccinated, you are protecting those in your community who can't be vaccinated -- the very young and the very sick. These are the two groups that would also get the most seriously ill if they got the disease, whether it's measles or whooping cough or whatever. Also, vaccinations are not 100% effective, so even a few vaccinated people can end up with the disease if they are exposed to it.

So those people who refuse to vaccinate their kids are not only putting their own kids' health at risk. They are also putting other people's kids (or older relatives with immune problems) at risk too. 

It's a public health issue.

<TEXT> Yeah they can be inconvenient. Maybe she could set it to vibrate rather than beep. If she calibrates it though, and is pretty confident in the readings, she can probably do fewer finger prick tests during the day. You do have to confirm with a fingerprick before giving an insulin dose though.

Good luck to you both. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dexcom is a brand of continuous glucose monitor: http://dexcom.com/

A sensor has to be inserted like a pump site, and the sensor sends a glucose reading from the interstitial fluid between your cells, every couple of minutes. You carry around a receiver with a screen that shows you the info. My son has found it helps with control but it is a hassle to deal with a second site, and the receiver is another thing to lug around, so he only uses it sporadically. Plus you have to confirm with a finger stick before doing a correction with insulin, because the interstitial readings can be less accurate than the blood readings you get with a conventional bg monitor with finger sticks. But it is a great tool to fine tune control because it also shows trends, like if you are dropping or rising quickly.

He has used the front part of his thighs. And he uses the angled insertion set, the minimed silhouette, so he can get a shallower insertion. He is very thin, and like I said, he has run into too-quick insulin uptake issues there, so his go-to is still butt/hip. 

Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He uses a minimed silhouette angled insertion kit and yes, he does use the inserter. When he was a kid I used to do the insertions for him and I agree, the way that thing shoots in there looks pretty violent. But he has always used the inserter and still does. 

When I say hip, I really mean upper butt, towards the outside. So like under the outer side of a back jean pocket. Not on the actual side of the hip, where the pants side seam would be. I would say upper outer quadrant of his butt is probably his most used site over the years. He also uses his thighs, but gets quicker uptake of insulin there so he can potentially have more low bgs with thighs. He uses stomach only for his Dexcom cgm at this point. I know some people use upper outer arm for pump sites, but he does not like the idea of the tubing going up through his shirt. 

Hope this helps.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been there, though I've never lost that much to begin with. When I signed up for this subreddit, I saw that someone had suggested reading Brain Over Binge by Kathryn Hansen. I found it interesting and it has been helpful to me, I think. I definitely have emotional triggers for eating and this book kind of released me from feeling that I had to solve every potential psychological issue in order to lose weight. The book spells out how many eating issues are habit, and that kind of took the power of that habit away for me, or at least enabled me to see it in less daunting terms and as a more manageable thing that I could control.

That said, I also agree with the practical advice others have given here to track calories. My Fitness Pal will break down what you eat into percentages of carb, protein and fat. That's been helpful to me because I found that upping the percentage of protein and even fat as a percentage of my daily calories has helped me feel fuller longer. Some people have had success with keto too, though I am not going that route. To me, logging is a good way to keep the feeling that, while I may fall off the wagon sometimes and be less than perfect, I can keep control and meet my goal at the next meal, or the next day. 

Lastly, maybe you need to up your caloric intake somewhat from 1500 for awhile. That may be contributing to your going off the diet after 3-4 days.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for your reply. It's very helpful. The issue of sleep is especially interesting. I've always been a night owl and now at age 60 it's gotten pretty dysfunctional -- I'm usually sleep-deprived. I've read that regular sleep habits, and adequate sleep, are important to dieting, but changing my sleep habits has been difficult. If I go to bed early I just wake up every 90 minutes. I think I'm going to need to tire myself out with more exercise and then walk bedtime back gradually.

Also glad to hear that diet is 80% of the weight-loss equation because I've let my diet plan get derailed on days I can't exercise, like "why bother, I can't get on the treadmill today so I've already blown it."

Lastly, glad to hear your endorsement of MFP and low-carb. I've tried weight watchers online  but I don't think it's a good fit for me because I like to get the calorie and nutritional info. I think calorie counting is a better fit for me. I like carbs so I'm going to need to watch them.

I'm trying to do a serious diet and lose 50 pounds. I'm 5'6" and 200, got up there gradually over the years, topped out at 211 six years ago, have made half-hearted and inconsistent efforts since then. My weight as a young person was low 120s  but I'd be happy with 150 as a goal for now.

Thank you again for your response -- you are very kind and a great example!

Patrons can use those accounts to compile booklists of items they'd like to read, to do an interlibrary loan or a hold request electronically, etc. I don't think those accounts would be likely to retain a title after the book was checkout out, but perhaps in some systems they can. Since the patron controls the login, privacy would be maintained, I suppose.  </TEXT>

There is no way to retrieve that information. There is no list of what people check out that individual librarians can use or disable. You say that some libraries can override this system and keep the records, but deletion is always the default setup and I've never encountered a library that overrode that.  </TEXT>

Also, libraries keep records of the number of times items are checked out, just not who checks them out, so you could draw some conclusions by comparing the checkout rates of various items with the publicly available census info on the demographics of the community, or before and after a historical event, etc. A historian can do plenty of research with conventional historical methods, without prying into the identities, incomes, etc., of library users. An actual historian would know that. </TEXT>

My goals are to count calories every day with MFP and to get exercise daily. Do people set number goals, in terms of pounds lost per month? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Glad to see your post, and all the comments in response. My weight gain has been gradual over the past 10 years or so, and coincides with my going from 50 to 60 years old. I know I'm invisible, figured it was a combo of the weight and the aging. I'm actually happy to see it's not all just paranoia in my head and is an actual thing! 

Congrats on your progress! </TEXT>

"The N.F.L.s actuaries assumed that 28 percent of all players would be found to have one of the compensable diseases and that the league would pay out $900 million to them. Their calculations showed that players younger than 50 had an 0.8 percent chance of developing Alzheimers or dementia, compared with less than 0.1 percent for the general population. For players ages 50 to 54, the rate was 1.4 percent, compared with less than 0.1 percent for the general population. The gap between the players and the general population grows wider with increasing age." </TEXT>

<TEXT> @eatyourbrain -- Why do you say that? They are not drawing conclusions about the police shootings; the "malpractice" is the failure to compile national stats on police shootings. The government certainly keeps stats on just about everything else. 

Here's another piece on the issue by NPR:

http://www.npr.org/2014/08/21/342228794/ferguson-turns-lens-on-police-involved-killings-but-some-facts-are-few
In the NPR story, note what the U of Missouri prof says about the lack of info on police shootings:

"I've actually heard police executives say that they don't want to have a national reporting system because then people will compare and say, well, you know, this police department shoots more people than that police department. And it'll lead to problems"

<TEXT> @PintoTheBurninator--our small business got the same type of letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, offering us the chance to re-up with our current plan for another year on Dec 1 or go with a cheaper plan with somewhat poorer coverage starting Jan 1. The cheaper plan offered featured 80 percent rather than 90 percent coverage but apparently has a meaningful out- of- pocket limit -- our current plan's out- of -pocket limit is so loaded with exceptions it's almost meaningless.

So I'm somewhat worried about what we'll get after next year but we'll see. Our business pays a ton for our group coverage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words. I came to reddit after the demise of digg, where, for awhile, substantive discussion did seem possible. I can understand reddit moderators' efforts to prevent flame wars and self-promotion, but I think you need to be careful about banning news and commentary sources. It certainly makes you look biased, even if that is not your intent.

At the very least, the process of determining which sources are legit, and why, should be transparent. What are your criteria for inclusion as a source, and why? Anything short of that looks like prejudice or a hidden agenda.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, i use reddit to try to disseminate information I find valuable, in the areas of politics, health, tech, and women's issues. I don't think reddit should block access to any news source, frankly. It's members should decide the source's value, via upvotes or downvotes. I thought that was the whole idea of reddit -- largely unmediated access to information by its members. I don't want some redditor, whose agenda I have no clue about, making decisions about what I can see on reddit or what I can post from legitimate news sources. 

You may quibble about Huffpo --I'd disagree with you on excluding it -- but Salon and especially Mother Jones? Really? That looks to me like a conservative or libertarian bias -- and again, bias is just the opposite of what reddit should be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brooks is an intellectually dishonest disgrace who never has the guts to actually argue in a forthright manner for the right-wing causes he supports. He tries to sneak in his real agenda under cover of a "reasonable moderate guy" persona, but that approach results in his "argument," if you can call it that, being illogical when you actually take the time to look closely. Most of his column's commenters get that and so does Taibbi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brooks is the most intellectually dishonest hack I've ever read. His standard operating procedure is to pose as a reasonable middle of the road guy and then to slip in his real, Republican-water-carrying point and hope that no one notices that he is really pushing the standard right-wing agenda and not some middle ground at all. He's a loathesome toady, and Taibbi gets that. 

If you think for a minute that Brooks' disingenuous column was in favor of gay marriage, then I guess you're proof that his sneaky approach does work on some people. Guess it worked on j purdy below too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People who swear and get abusive in their posts are revealing the weakness of their arguments. Military-style assault weapons were developed for use in war, to kill people. They are inanimate objects that are used by people.

"Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal came out in favor of gun control restrictions in a Tuesday morning appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."

"I spent a career carrying typically either a M16, and later a M4 carbine," he said. "And a M4 carbine fires a .223 caliber round, which is 5.56 millimeters, at about 3,000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It's designed to do that. That's what our soldiers ought to carry."

Said McChrystal, "I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look -- I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want -- but we have to protect our children and our police and we have to protect our population. And I think we have to take a very mature look at that."

So I imagine the general is wrong, according to you. And you know better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I cared about knowing the total number of deaths by drownings I would include all deaths by drownings. If you only want to look at murders, then find a report that only looks at murders -- that's not what this one does. But from a public safety standpoint, when talking about regulation, all deaths are more relevant than just murders -- including accidents and suicides. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have not been shooting but do have a family member who is a hunter. 

In my opinion, the previous assault weapon ban was ineffective because NRA-backed members of Congress inserted a lot of loopholes. 

I'm not an absolutist on an assault ban, though, and think we should get what we can on this issue, such as universal background checks and improved mental health reporting. I predict that the NRA will come out as strongly against universal background checks, though.

I agree on the gang violence -- I think universal background checks, and a trafficking provision, would help there. I live in the Chicago area, and recently read that a large percentage of Chicago gang guns are purchased from third parties who buy them in largish batches from our gun-lax neighbor, Indiana.

<TEXT> GalantGuy, I agree that the issue is more complex than simply banning assault weapons and I appreciate your reasonableness and civility. I am in favor of being as reality-based, scientific, and results-oriented as possible in trying to solve the problem. 

Studies have shown that violent video games and movies don't seem to increase a person's propensity for killing other people, as does the common-sense observation that they obviously have those things in countries with much lower rates of violence. 

I don't think it's practical to have an armed policeman at every entrance to every school in the country, plus in school parking lots, sporting events, etc. Even if we could do that, kid-shooters could just go elsewhere, like parks, Little League games or Chuckie Cheese.

I don't go for stop and frisk or TSA style screenings. 

I agree that all these measures are overkill. The whole country shouldn't be on lockdown to guard against a relatively few nuts. I do think improved access to mental health and more realistic reporting laws on dangerously unhinged people might help, but even then you have family members who are enablers or in denial, like Nancy Lanza. 

It just seems more logical to me to make the weapons that are designed to kill a lot of people quickly unavailable. I don't see why anyone outside of the military or law enforcement would need those weapons. Mass shootings would still occur from time to time with non-automatic weapons, but at least the killers would be less efficient and a few more people would live.

If we had a way to prevent lightning strikes, wouldn't we try to do that?

Also here is how the Daily Beast arrived at the numbers I linked to above:
"Our methodology was simple: Rather than measure the number of guns, we measured the measure of gun deaths per capita in each state, using the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That counted for 75 percent of the ranking. The other 25 percent was derived from the Legal Community Against Violence's state-by-state comparison of firearm laws, which ranks all 50 states by their relatively severity, incorporating everything from policies on mental-health background checks to whether loaded guns are allowed in bars." </TEXT>

Tight-weak is the worst of all worlds  when you have a weak hand, you lose, and when you have a strong hand, you fail to maximize your position."

They have made a clear moral choice: that the comfort and emotional reassurance they take from the possession of guns, placed in the balance even against the routine murder of innocent children, is of supreme value. Whatever satisfaction gun owners take from their gunswe know for certain that there is no prudential value in themis more important than childrens lives. Give them credit: life is making moral choices, and thats a moral choice, clearly made."

And why would you take "urban demograhics" out of the equation, anyway? Don't people killed with firearms in the cities count as much as people killed by firearms out in the country? The majority of people in the US live in metropolitan areas, you know, something like 83% I believe.

Yes the US firearms murders are cultural -- the result of a culture in which access to guns is easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Occam's Razor. Simplest and least convoluted explanation makes the most sense to me. I also think it's telling that conservatives seem to be interpreting Romney's statement the same way I do --it's not just the liberals who see it that way. But as you say YMMV.

I also think it's interesting that even your interpretation starts from the same assumption Romney does -- that people always vote only from their own financial self-interest.  It says a lot about the way his type of conservatives vote. I can't find the stats now, but read earlier today that twenty years ago 80-some percent of Republicans believed in some sort of government support for the poor, as opposed to 40-some percent now. 

I live in a reasonably high-earning household but I don't support the government giving me a tax break and raising the taxes of the elderly, the young, and the poor so that my family can pay less. I believe in the concept of citizenship and the social compact. The kind of concentration of wealth we have now is not good for our country and will strangle our competitiveness if we allow it to continue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I don't disagree that Congress deserves scrutiny, realistically any changes in seats are going to come at the margins.

The race for president is too close for us to take our eyes off it now. Even if it's true that Reddit is overwhelmingly for Obama (which I see you got some pushback on), hopefully we go out and propagate these news stories and opinion pieces elsewhere as well, in addition to just talking to each other. 

If we support Obama, we should be trying to get helpful articles out there to undecided folk, via facebook or links in emails or whatever means we have. It's about convincing the undecided and about getting likely Obama voters to actually get out there and vote.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really think that's true. The tax returns are not analogous to the birth certificate.

It is reasonable to expect candidates for president to release their tax returns. It's not reasonable to expect them to repeatedly show a copy of their birth certificate.

The birthers are extreme fringe types asking something of Obama that has not been asked of any other candidate. Those asking for the tax returns include his primary opponents, journalists, and members of his own party who are just asking for information most candidates provide.

Romney saying he won't release any additional returns because opponents would only clamor for more is an excuse, not a reason. If he were to release even five years of returns, reasonable people would probably not ask for more. 

There is obviously something in those returns he doesn't want people to see.  </TEXT>
