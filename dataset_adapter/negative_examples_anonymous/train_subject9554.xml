<TEXT> Racism has nothing to do with the civil war. Well, that isn't entirely true, but you are making it seem like the north was against slavery, and the South was for it.

The north only freed the SOUTHERN slaves, so Britain couldn't side with the south for moral reasons. In fact, slaves in the border and northern states were still slaves. It wasn't until the 13th amendment that slaves were considered free.

<TEXT> You can use all weapons in competitive games. However, with many it isn't pheasible because of the cost. Low cost weapons are usually the best way to go, so if your economy isn't so good, you are still able to play with cheap weapons since you practiced with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Play DM with weapons that's you can use in comps. Ak, m4, tec 9, five seven, usps, glock, etc. An smg or 2 wouldn't hurt either.

Once your aim is on point, play a few M to see where you are stand I ng, your fall point will likely be your game sense. 

To improve gamesense, you need to analyze how you and others play. You also need to know what your are looking for, which many people dont. Watch this:https://youtu.be/AyuJ7pIgCbM

That should help a bit.

<TEXT> Tried it out and it was interesting to say the least. At one point my thrust broke, and I could only rely on vertical thrust to fly around haha. 

It feels very strange, especially having such a high sensitivity to your mouse movements, when compared to PS2. Flying doesn't feel much like Planetside, except for the controls I guess. It is a little too responsive, and you can fly backwards for ages if you just turn around.

Nice attempt, and I am sure that you could fix the issues if you put some more time into it. :D </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Laffer Curve </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-20 22:10:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ~~SOE~~ DB has decided to dramatically increase the price of many weapons, some of which gave the new players a competitive position against high(er) BRs. TB went from 100 to 875 certs (although the raise could be justified)-- basically, almost all vehicle weapons were raised to 875 certs.

What would be the reason for such an increase? Money -- don't waste your time spewing bullshit and claiming it isn't. This is where the Laffer Curve comes in. DB didn't raise the station cash (or whatever the name of the currency is now) price for the weapons because it would mean that less people would purchase them, they simply raised the price of the certs, in hopes that new players would either rage-quit, or spend money on the weapons.

Smed, I would be tossing $100 bills at this game if it was well optimized, bugs that players reported were fixed within a week, and the game was focused around **TEAM** play, not solo play. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Minecraft needs a building update </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-28 15:44:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Minecraft desperately needs and update to cater to the needs of builders. Minecraft has ignored the wishes of the players who love building and creativity, and many have stopped playing because of this.

1.) All building blocks must have a half slab and stair version of them. This is not only a very quick and easy addition to the game, it will put the game in a much better state than where it is right now. Imagine how much potential hay half-slabs and stairs will add to the game! 
2.) Vertical "stairs" and "half slabs" must be implemented. This is a long overdue feature that will allow players to be much more creative and add much detail to what they build. 

These two and simple additions to the game would bring back thousands of players who enjoyed building, and played Minecraft because of building. Mojang has ignored the minority of builders and has catered to the childish PvP centered barbarian majority. Minecraft has a lot of potential, please let builders build. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your two team suggestion would make it worse.... whoever writes the code should be fixing the bugs in that code. That is the most logical and efficient way to do it. Otherwise the developer responsible for fixing the bugs has to figure out what the first dev wrote and why.

Games are harder to develop than you think. Yes it's extremely disappointing, but that's life.

<TEXT> I don't understand how the SOE dev team works.... When the majority of pilots complain about something being broken, like a2a missles, or coyotes, nothing happens, yet when a minority or majority of ignorant infantry complain about something like the banshee, it is immediately nerfed?

The air game has been shit forever.... The constant gank squads of 4-5 ESFs running lockons ruins the experience, not to mention the fact that AA can kill an ESF as fast as an assault rifle can kill infantry. Why are the real problems being ignored?

Its a problem on every server, and on every continent, yet appeasing infantry is more imporant than fixing 1/3 of the game. The pilots have been ignored, are being ignored, and will be ignored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with g2a lockons is when you dive from flight ceiling after spotting a g2a enemy ESF. You engage in combat with that ESF, however, you have no friendly AA, and a HA locks onto you. Losing 1/3 of your health in mere seconds while in a dogfight is ridiculous. Unless you have great aim, and can quickly take out your target, and are dead.

There are situational exceptions, such as a valley to hide behind on Indar. And whatever else have you, but on continents like esamir, you are screwed. The chances of successfully running away from an ESF are slim.

It would be nice to have a "fix all." As everything has little versatility. In a place where there is an enemy ESF farming your faction, and it is a small fight an no one or one person is countering the ESF, it would be nice for aa lockons to do a bit more damage.

If the vehicle is at a stop, the repair rates are the same as getting out and repairing. The vehicle will still lose health, it will just save time getting in and out.

<TITLE> I hate continent locking! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-01 18:47:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I despise the new system of continent locking, and fail to understand what the goal of this system is. I assumed the continent locking system would prevent unbalanced populations on continents, or bring players from indar onto Esamir and Amerish, however, I was truly disappointed.

The only continent I enjoy playing on is Esamir. The landscape isn't the greatest, however, that is the only continent that I can get good frames on, because PS2 is so poorly optimized, it makes Arma 2 look good. Now, after switching between 3 different characters, on 3 different servers, it just so happens that Esamir is locked on all of them.

What is the point of the continent locking system? Well, on the bright side, SOE statistics on performance will now show that the game is performing even better, because everyone who plays on Esamir because their PC cannot handle med-large battles on the other continents, due to the poor optimization, memory leaks, and so forth, will quit playing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why does SOE constantly over-nerf? First, they needed rocket pods, so they didn't hurt infantry, now they are merging them against vehicles? 

First they said that rocket pods were meant to kill tanks, now yet are meant only AI?

So tell me SOE, what fked up stats are you basing these nerfs on? You clearly aren't takin into consideration that sky guard will destroy all air now, since libs and ESF won't stand a chance against them? When you use your statistics to make nerfs, do you take into account the amount of dodging that ESF's must do while fighting vehicles? Because the vehicles don't have to dodge, most of them can shoot back, and outdps the ESF's already.

Why don't you make small incremental nerfs, so you don't overdo it, and make the vehicle useless?

You can easily take down enemy air with 20 mins of practice with any AA weapon, whereas it takes 30-50 hours of flying to be decent.

<TEXT> Rocket pods don't need a nerf... It is hard enough to survive coming within 500m of an enemy sunderer with enemies that think "oh, look, air! Let's grab AA!"

Have you thought this through? I feel like this will do more damage to the air game, and the lib issues aren't being fixed: they can  turn around practically as fast as am ESF. It is ridiculously hard to fight a solo lib, considerig it is a bomber, it should need an ESF escort to survive enemy ESF attacks.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am not here to start a war. I do not like to look at things from one side, so i am just going to ask you some questions, hopefully you won't take offense.

Let's start like this, I was raised as a Christian. We went to church every Sunday, I mindlessly prayed, went to Sunday school. I began to despise going to church. It was just boring, all that was discussed was the same concepts of love, respect.

I began to question the bible, gods, and their existence. I began to see a lot of contradictions, and when I asked my parents, they either changed the subject, or told me I should talk to the padtor.

I did just that, yet I still kept getting strange answers, that contradicted what was said by others in the past.

Out of curiosity, I read the bible, word by word. That too was full of contradictions, and passages that could be interpreted both ways.


Why have you started believing?

Have you read the bible word for word and seeked an unbiased meaning?

What are your personal opinions about athiests?

Do you think that it is right for God to send athiests to hell for eternity, because they didn't let him save them from him?

What are your opinions on heaven/hell? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Isaiah 45:7: I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things

Exodus 32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people

Judges 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit

Jeremiah 45:5 behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD:

Jeremiah 49:37 I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

Micah 1:12 . evil came down from the LORD

Micah 2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil

Exodus 22:29-30 You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The first-born of your sons you shall give to me. You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.

Ezekiel 20:25-26 Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life; and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. Links are now enabled to be posted on comments. Yes, you have been able to post links by changing symbols etc. however, those links were harder to use, and less people used them. Now, comments are a Stewart to spreading RATS.
2. Comments no longer have a character limit. Although you can now better voice your opinions, and bring out your argument in one comment instead of four, there is a lot more spam that comes with this system.
3. Top comments aren't relevant. The only way that top comments are deemed relevant to the video, is through google. Here is a good example: http://i.imgur.com/3YS2RmA.png
4. Google+ deleted subscriptions and profile picture(s). When you add an account, feel free to resub to all of your subscriptions,because "upgrading" deleted all those.
5. Google+ is an extra hassle to the simple commenting system we had In the past. Google has failed to address the flaws in the previous system, an ha created more weak points I. The recent update. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't work because it is worse than the old system. You have bots posting links now, and these links are-- I'm assuming viruses. The comments no longer have a character limit, which just brings a.whole new level to the spam.

All the replies aren't hooked together. Honestly, reddit has the best system for comments, communication wise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome to Real-RPG The new generation of roleplaying

Donator Rewards list: http://real-rpg.enji...donator-rewards
Welcome to the server. I am train_subject9554, I help every player whenever I can, trying to make their minecraft expirience the best. On our server we feature maximum anti-grief, Builders, and police. We are trying to overcome the dying servers of minecraft. A lot of minecraft servers out there, are well.... Shit, hosted on peoples computers, not on a professional companies computer, with maximum connection. We offer 24 Hour server service, and you can play anytime. We hope you come and join us =)

Rules:

1.) No griefing

2.) No spamming

3.) Respect others

4.) No hacks of any kind

5.) No cheats of any kind



Mechanics:

Living:

When you join, you are given a large amount of choices, and you must live like you do in real life. When you first login, you will be able to greet others etc. First you must get a place to live, there are apartments and hotels in the spawn town, or you can go into the wild and make your own house.







Drugs:

The secret word is lol. Admins are the FBI agents, they, and Police (mods) will work together to make drug busts. The current drugs are mushrooms, and sugarcanes. After you are caught with drugs, you will be sent to a probation officer every week. The probation officers are advanced Police officers, which manage all the players that have been caught with drugs.






:
Companies/Jobs

This is going to be long, as there is a lot to explain. When you join, you have the opportunity to look for an employer. More advanced employers have a prefix made for the company, and have the company prefix color. To have this, the employers must have donated $5 or more. The employers are your managers etc. They will pay you to do their companies job. Each company is a supplier, unless you are a store. If you are a store company, for ex. Walmart, you can make stores, and pay the supplying companies, money for their stock. When you pay the company, the employer pays his employees, this is what runs our server. You can chose from the following to make your company:

1.) Store

2.) Farming co.

3.) Mining co.

4.) Fishing co.

and any other resource gathering/selling companies. You can make blacksmiths etc, what ever jobs you find in real life you can make.








Towns:

Towns must have a theme, a town without a theme will not exist. Each theme has to be someone similar to the towns it is near. There should never be a medival town, near a futuristic town. Default towny stuff...
To join the server:

1.) Post your IGN on the thread (optional, if you do you get $1000)

2.) Login
