<TEXT> I work in music distribution on the retail side of things. I've been lucky enough to work both at major labels and indie labels. People are buying records more than you think so thank you to everyone who supports artists and by association, the people like us who work for them. It is part of my job to get familiar with every DMS (digital music service) as to better cater our content to their consumers. 

I am a Spotify power user. I love Spotify. It is my choice for on demand streaming. There are tons of great alternatives that essentially provide the same benefits like Deezer, now soft launching in the US, Rdio, Google Play All Access, Tidal, Guvera and many more. 

While I use Spotify for the endless amounts of curated mixes for any mood, genre, decade, (not to mention pick   curate my own playlists) I use Google Play Access to store all of my owned and downloaded content in the cloud. This way I can listen to anything I own that may not be available for streaming. Google also has an a la carte download model akin to iTunes. 

A new service called MixRadio (formally Nokia Music) is what I use for personalized algorithmic based playlists. Users get 6 skips and it is ad supported but the amount of music I have learned from using this service has amazed me ever since its launch. It learns your likes and dislikes better than most all other services IMO. Definitely give it a try.

Other stores like eMusic are totally different. They have a tiered subscription model for members. Each tier allows customers to buy a certain dollar amount of music a month. $11.99 a month gives you roughly 25 song downloads at $.69 - $.99 a track or 3-4 full albums. The plans range from amount to amount but prices are very competitive to combat iTunes leading download store market share. 

End of the day, it is what works for you. As long as you consume music in a way that is convenient all while supporting the artists and business people behind the scenes, its all good. Happy listening!

<TEXT> Great point. Last night's really put that into perspective. 

TV spoilers below. 

So many things seem so trivial now but conversely, a lot of the feuds between houses could impact so much in the grand scheme of things. Bolton v Baratheon will determine if we see an entire army aid in the fight against the wights. Dany will most likely learn of what is really going on beyond the wall and focus her attention there. Tyrion will have to be our champion here. Her dragons now hold a huge key to forging weapons to fight the most dangerous threat known to their world. So she better learn to tame those things. And Bran is acting as Frodo did in LOTR. A huge burden to bear, essentially alone. We all probably suspect he and his contingent will be a huge asset to the fight against the Night King and his army. Not to mention so many others. My brain hurts. So many possibilities and all we can do is sit at the mercy of D D/GRRM. 

Edit: grammar </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just think so much of Power Windows and Caress of Steel are underrated. I love 'The Necromancer' and 'Fountain of Lamneth' so much not to mention those tracks helped birth '2112'. Geddy's bass parts on Power Windows are amazing. Namely 'The Big Money', 'Grand Designs' and 'Marathon'. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am blown away every time I dry my hands in a bathroom with a Dyson Air Blade. I want to know how you came up with this restroom marvel of the 21th century. Thank you! Here are my questions.

1. How did you come up with the idea for the Dyson Air-Blade?

2. Who did you tell first about the idea to affirm your desires for a superior hand dryer and how did they react to learning that you wanted to make something that blows air out instead of being sucked in?

3. Do you think your invention has revolutionized modern bathrooms across the globe and if so, how?

4. Have you ever left a restroom using your own invention saying to yourself "Wow! My hands are so dry and that was fucking fun" just like we all do when we use your product?

5. What is your favorite type of chicken wing sauce?

* Receiver: Technics SA 303 (1980)
* Headphones: Audio Technica ATH-M50 (comes with a quarter inch adapter for receivers etc)
* Not Pictured (Acoustic Research Large Bookend Speakers) 
* CD liner note notebooks given to me by an old boss of mine. Features Led Zeppelin, Rush, MMJ and others

For Under 500 USD you can get your music room similarly set up. It really is very solid IMO! If I had my way I would have gotten better speakers but as long as you have music and a comfy chair (my great grandfathers leopard colored-zebra patterned is what I use) you are golden!

<TEXT> perhaps but I feel that some genres still command a core following; a certain type of 'stereotypical' listener. Or it might just mean that music is more accessible and due to this people are listening to all different genres rather because they are all so easy to find. The internet is a global musical-ecosystem where all of these genres are floating around and is easy to access by all types of people. In contrast before the internet, it was much harder to find different types of music outside of what your community's radios were playing. That was why your spectrum of choice was mostly influenced by the radio and perpetuated to the other people around them and down the line to kids etc etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bill Laurance was an original member Snarky Puppy, not to mention many of the personnel on his new record are from the current incarnation of the group. This includes Snarky Puppy's leader Michael League on bass and "Sput", one of their amazing drummers. Makes sense to me that Bill Laurance would record his album in similar Snarky Puppy fashion. The 'live' recording setup seems to work well for Ropeadope artists. 

As far as the musical influence, I hear something that strays a bit further left field from Snarky Puppy's concept of sound but I can totally understand what you're saying. In my opinion 'Swift', Laurance's new record, strays further away from the gospel of fusion that Snarky Puppy has given us and has taken an almost Phillip Glass contemporary classical oriented approach. The textures and themes throughout the songs almost are reminiscent of minimalist music of the 20th century. Sprinkle some Snarky Puppy juice on there and you have one hell of a musical cocktail.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you see this changing in the future? How will we use wood to build our homes? Do you think we will see a shift to using more manmade materials over wood? Have you started to see this at all? Sorry for the questions. Very interested to learn what your thoughts are. 

Edit: I am speaking from a North American perspective. I am learning now that it seems we love our timber more than most of the world. Fascinating to hear about the alternatives and how sustainable wood is!

<TITLE> ELI5: Why do we still use wood as the internal frame for most of our habitable buildings like houses or offices? You'd think after all this time we'd come up with a way to utilize a different, more accident resistant material or develop one on our own. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was commuting to work and I saw a newly completed wood frame of an apartment complex made from - well you guessed it - wood! Nothing crazy. We build shit with wood all the time. Seems just like standard fare at this point. 

But wood is prone to so much damage especially over time; accidents, rotting, etc etc not to mention other environmental reasons. Why (besides our lack of desire for change and the sheer convenience factor) something else more durable and for lack of a better term, 'furureproof' has not been used or developed yet? If it has been, why has it not been made scalable.

EDIT: Thanks for your responses everyone. I am learning so much about wood, its uses in modern home construction, its sustainability and all of the alternative materials the rest of the world uses to build its homes. This is great! 

EDIT 2: So far today I learned that you can make not only houses from hemp but cars as well. Add that to the list of things everyone has contributed with, I can say that wood is very cool. Seems that while wood may work great in some places, in others it does not make as much sense. Love the endless stream of information that has been put forth in the thread, so for that I thank you all for answering my question and exceeding my wildest expectations. Looking forward to seeing us innovate with both timber and other materials as we build our homes in safer and stronger ways than ever before. 

EDIT 3: "Wood actually grows on trees" Cheers for that, folks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all. New to owning any vintage gear so go easy on me :D I just got this receiver and after getting to know it a bit better, I have grown to really love it. There are some kinks however:
-Upon opening the box after getting it from my FedEx man and plugging it in, the left channel produced a very fuzzy, uncentered sound. After playing around, it seemed to go away. This was all in while my turntable was plugged into phono. Aux seems to work ok in that regard. Phono later seemed to work fine. Used for a few days and no issues. After work today I played a record and the left channel seemed to do the same thing but after switching to aux and back to phono, that fuzzy gross sound was gone. I feel like it needs a few to warm up. Anyone else have similar experience?
-While plugged into aux and with phones plugged in, the volume in the left channel decreases suddenly w.o warning. 
-Overall, the left channel is more muffled than a crystal clear right. I tested the speakers and it is not them. In the mix, it all sounds balanced and really warm. I have checked both the main and remote channels and they produce the same sound. 
-In the end, I love the quality of sound this thing produces. Overall, my Technics can play many records and sound great especially if I am spinning vintage records (Rush, Steely Dan, Police, Steve Miller Etc) and even sounds great with the newer stuff (Glass Animals, Sharon Jones, Flylo etc) It seems to me that hiccups only happen within the first 10 minutes off a cold start. I am wondering if these little quirks are all part of owning awesome equipment like this and if anyone has similar problems and how they deal/dealt with them. Thanks all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all. Just bottled our dry Irish stout yesterday and I noticed that it had a soy sauce smell. Gave it a taste and for an uncarbed, room temp beer, it had the right flavor and an aftertaste reminiscent that of a guinness. I am sure its all part of the beers progression to my glass but wondering if anyone else has had a similar smell upon bottling their dry stout. Cheers! </TEXT>

Then I see these white things on the side or my fermenter after 3 days. Any ideas? Is this an infection or should I not worry? I'm tempted to dump it an try again for real in a week or so. Its only like 2 gallons.

<TEXT> Hey all. New AG brewer and I would love some ideas for recipes you have tried with success. I am into any style of beer but my favorites are dry-Irish Stout's and virtually any English Blonde or Brown Ale. Would love to keep it noob friendly for all those who only have limited resources and experience like myself. I have a 5 gallon mashtun and a 5 gallon brew pot along with everything that came with Brewers Best base starter kit + a second 5 Gallon Fermenter. The more detail in your instructions would really help myself (as well as others looking to start or have just started AGB) out. Thanks a lot and look forward to reading! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh I definitely will get myself and iodine test. I didnt know I could get it at a CVS. 

As I get more familiar with all grain, I will try out some irish moss. I have heard good things. 

As for the carboy, I usually cover it with a towel to prevent light exposure. I removed it for the pics. Should I be wetting this towel? Does it really have a large impact on temperature?

Wondering how I can be sure I used enough water per pound of grain in y mash so for next time I want to be sure. I used http://www.brewersfriend.com/mash/
If I wish to build a recipe giving me 3 gallons at the end, what is the best way of going about that? Love the help so thanks a lot for that! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! I will invest in my own hydrometer. I left it at my buddies place from our last brew. Rookie move. I will also see how an iodine test can help if they are not expensive. Will need to research refractors and buy a hose for my barb on my mash tun.

 

Here are some pic updates.

Looks like its fermenting nicely. Some observations:

The color in ambient light is a nice dark Guinness like brown/light black. Shined a light to get a good look at the inside (to see what the hop situation is like) hops seem to floating around and appear to chillin on the krausen. What perplexed me was the color under this little light. It was more of a unattractive brown (see pics for an idea)  Cause for concern? I referred to my other beer for reference. 

My Irish red looks and smells amazing especially in ambient light. I then shined a light on it briefly and it too had a weird brownish hue. I am thinking the light doesn't help any appearances. 

I am gathering I extracted enough sugars from the malt and pitched enough yeast as it's a pretty active fermentation. Let me know if anyone has some advice as to how to clear up the beer, colors in early stages of fermentation etc. Would love to hear back. Thanks !  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just winged my first all-grain batch and I am not sure whats going to happen now. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have a few extract batches under my belt and I was really excited about trying an all grain recipe! I made my mash tun and I was ready to go. (I thought) So I went to my local homebrew shop and asked for enough ingredients for a 3 gallon batch. He hooked me up with assorted grains and hops for a porter. 2 row pale, chocolate, crystal, black and hops. I preheated my mash tun and then I started the process. 

I mashed for an hour at 151 degrees and vorlaufted until the wort was clear. It looked really good actually! Fly sparged but not sure if I did it well enough. Over time I expect I will understand more of how that works...
The boil really looked great. Barely anything floating in there, the foam looked like a barista at a coffee shop took his time making a cappuccino but instead of coffee it was my wort. I was pumped.

So the boil when on for an hour and the guy who gave me the ingredients said to just hop at flame out. I was like hmmm maybe I will add some at 30 minutes. So I did. I also added some at the very end of my boil. Thats when I was like hmmm. I see too many hops hopping around in this thing. Not sure if thats ok. I said dont focus on it...


After cooling the wort to 70 degrees there seemed to be a lot of gook at the bottom of my boil pot. It gave the wort an interesting hoppy aroma, naturally. Not that it was bad, just something I was not expecting. Then I siphoned into the carboy. I aerated the wort in the 3 gal carboy for 2 minutes and pitched my yeast. Sealed it and now I am wondering wtf I did will be ok or if it will kill me. 
Long story (sorry) short, I have no idea what to expect and I was wondering if anyone out there has just said 'hey Im going to see what happens today" and what the results were. Not sure how efficient the brew was as it was my first all grain but its all a learning process. (I am a novice homebrewer and I would appreciate any feedback. I really do enjoy the craft ----) Thanks for reading! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah thanks! I worry about the rules. Slowly noticing people take the trial and error approach with building these (and other things) I guess. As long as you have a seal, something to filter out grains on the inside, food safe parts and a way to transfer into a kettle, one would assume everything will work out, no? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! When you say 'not that great', how do you mean? I am not too worried but just was wondering what the community thinks. I didnt hydrate the yeast before pitching. What are the benefits of that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I brewed a 1 gal batch of Irish Red the other day. Wondering if adding too much yeast affects clarity of the beer. They said to add roughly half but I may have added 55-60% of the packet at most to the fermenter. The fermentation was "happy" to say the last. Very active and I needed a blow off. When I exchanged the blow off for the air lock the aroma was very pleasant! Looking forward to drinking this one in a few weeks. Any thoughts  ?? </TEXT>
