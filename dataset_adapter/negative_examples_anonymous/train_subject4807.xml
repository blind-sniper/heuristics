<TEXT> they don't have to release information regarding their policies

I'm sure a fast-growing private equity buyout firm like BC Partners will mind their legal P Qs. But here the issue isn't whether it's legal to do it, but whether it's fair.

 the manager positions I mentioned are now off the career guide on the website.

You might also want to see if they are still visible through [the Internet Archive WayBack Machine](http://archive.org/web/) and if so take screenshots. At this point, I'd say document everything and figure out later which pieces are important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The union you want to talk with is probably United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the largest union for retail workers. I don't want to discourage anybody from joining a union, but it's not easy and this company is already so far along in restructuring that you may not be able to do anything to stop it.

A recognized union, with a contract, only works when it formalizes already existing unity among the workers. For PetSmart to reach the point of recognition and contract would be a many year long process, necessarily involving thousands of workers, that could only get started if the UFCW believed it had a good possibility of success ... and right now, UFCW has other and bigger companies in their sights.

HOWEVER: the changes you describe may well create a situation in which there could be enough unity among the workers in your particular shop to get some concessions even without a contract. Go talk to the organizing director of your regional UFCW office, and don't be shy. You don't have a lot to lose by doing so. And if several workers go together to management and announce their intention to form a union, you may even get additional protection from retaliation under the National Labor Relations Act.

You can and should double check anything I said here with your state AFL-CIO before acting on it. I *was* a national union staff organizer, but that was years ago and my recollection may be rusty. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT>   people are scheduling it for the wrong time.

I don't think "people" are doing this, at least not actively. There's a common problem with scheduling software that sets the default at 12 noon unless the organizer sets it for another time -- which experienced users would know to do because most of the uses for such software are for individual, time variable events. But it becomes a problem when a lot of new folks are using the system to set up gatherings at a fixed time, because many assume the software will do that for them.

In any case, you can't possibly repeat your caution too often! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That study was in 2014. The most recent available estimate for the total voting age population in the US was [237,657,645 in 2012.](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/01/26/2012-1635/estimates-of-the-voting-age-population-for-2011) If the turnout is 40% (what Pew was expecting in 2014,not necessarily what happened), the approximate size of the Party of Non-Voters was then 60% of the total, or 142,594,587 individuals who need a reason to bother voting at all.

Of course those numbers are very rough, but the scale of it should provoke some hard thinking around here. To advance the campaign, much less win the nomination, will require refocusing from arguing with people who already read the news and vote to those who have everything to gain by voting (esp. for Bernie) but don't believe it yet.

And *that's* why face-to-face organizing matters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're going to keep adopting and mistreating animals until someone convinces them to do better. Simply stopping them from getting this particular kitten, or taking it later, won't work. I think you have to do the more difficult task of sitting down with them and talking about your concerns, without precipitating bad feelings. 

And remember, even adults can grow up more, and maybe they have or are starting to do so. In this case, it's a good sign that they went to a shelter that vets the cat and requires an interview and fee -- many people would have just grabbed the nearest "free kittens" ad on Craiglist. Try to build on that: "You obviously care enough to select a healthy kitten and make sure it's medically protected. Do you need any info or help with raising it?" is the gist of the message, although I'm sure you can find better words. Speak to their better selves, give them a chance to do the right thing, and keep advocating if you see signs of trouble. If his parents are also your mate's parents (am I reading this right?) maybe they can also help.

Just don't assume, even with the evidence you cite, that this can't work. Help them make it work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So where's the Sanders vote going to come from? The only place it could come from in order for him to win: Existing Hillary supporters.

This is the failure of imagination that informs all of the Beltway press skepticism about Sanders. In reality, the largest block of potential supporters is what the Pew Research Center, using methodology far superior to that used here, identified as [The Party of Non-Voters](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/). This group could be the clear margin of victory *if they can be organized and mobilized* in  the next year. 

This 2014 study by Pew is so important that all Sanders supporters should read it and think deeply about what it will take to get these folks to believe it's worthwhile to vote at all. Fortunately, I'm willing to bet that many members of The Party of Nonvoters hang out on reddit.

The one sector of Clinton's base that is problematic for Sanders is her strong support among African-Americans, which may well prove to be unmovable.  </TEXT>

This is not your conclusion, it was your premise -- and it's laughably wrong. Aside from not grasping how the political process worked here, your notion of who smokes is a baseless stereotype. Because you don't smoke, you have no idea how many lawyers, lawmakers, doctors, successful business owners, soldiers, soccer moms and other upright citizens smoke pot.

Adding, we all "know" a lot of things about social psychology, but it takes studies producing consistent results over time to change norms and policies. It's not like the money for this even *could* be redirected, even if we were dealing with a zero sum budget, which we're not here.

You should take another look at the dominant pattern of lone wolf domestic terrorism in the US over the past three decades. Anger at losing control over or being unable to connect with women is the single most obvious recurring element aside from access to weapons. I'd be happy if results from this study *only* helped with this one issue -- and there are a lot for other benefits to learning what makes such men tick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This analysis is assbackwards: Responsible Ohio's petition is failing because voters who support legalization have *succeeded* in organizing against this particular initiative, convincing others to not sign even to put it on the ballot because of the monopolistic structure of the proposed "reform". RO has so little support that they are having to use almost exclusively paid circulators, whose valid signature rate is laughable and probably won't get any better in the next 10 days.

We're all going to have to wait for something better, and it doesn't help that the competing "grassroots" initiative seems completely incapable of leading anything (for reasons that have nothing to do with being stoned).  </TEXT>

The best treatment for the whole house is NOT sold at the pet store, but at the vet's office, because this is what they use: Siphotrol Plus II Premise Spray. It's the nuclear bomb of flea treatments: works instantly and for months afterwards. But it's not to be used lightly -- if you're not being bitten, it's not time for this stuff yet. If you do have to use it, follow the directions to the letter ... and then relax, because the problem will be over for the year.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Capitalism. The same system that includes big, rich companies *and* a propaganda culture that promotes unrealistic expectations about entrepreneurship, mostly based on the notion that it's desirable to cut expenses at the expense of the very people who make profit possible. There are millions of businesses that are functionally under-capitalized and always will be, but their deserved demise is delayed by widespread acceptance of an unsustainable definition of value.

And that's all I have for now, because I have to go pick up my brilliant sweetie from his criminally underpaid job.

Okay, then: yes. 

I'm referring to a whole system, not one business. I have sympathy for the employees tasked with enforcing the current definition of value by trying to hire people for far less than the true social value of their work, but that's not going to stop me from pointing out that the entire concept is distorted in a system that overvalues individual acquisition of wealth over social responsibility.

Managers who can't hire for this reason are being set up to fail by the people who set "the company budget". </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to listening to BLM, Bernie needs a reorientation on how to present his views on the relationship between race and class. His analysis is correct that eliminating wealth inequality is a necessary precondition to eliminating race and gender inequality. But simply making that assertion is insufficient, especially in a culture so divided by the history of slavery and the grotesque distortions of identity politics over the past 30 years. He has to be able to explain in plain English *why* that is the case.

Adding, the BLM folks were not attacking Bernie. They were trying to get the attention of a major conference of mostly white progressives -- and the national press there to cover Bernie. I don't know what panels NN15 did on racism or police accountability, but I do know they would never have been mentioned by the press if this hadn't happened. Sometimes, being formally "on the agenda" or even on the stage isn't enough. Sometimes, a little strategic rudeness is needed to reboot assumptions.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> best customer service

Sure as hell ain't Best Buy. And both Lowes and Home Depot are structured in such a way that any appliance repair service is probably from the manufacturer rather than the mall-type retailer. (I'm sure someone will correct this if I'm wrong.) 

I've always bought from Sears because their Kenmore appliances are extremely durable and their prices (especially at the Outlet Stores) are easily the best. The installers are another story, and I would recommend having someone else do that if you can. 

But I must say that the last time an installer screwed up, on an AC window unit, my complaint to customer service resulted in them *setting aside for review and then losing the entire purchase record* for that and the $800 refrigerator purchased at the same time, with the result that I got both for free. Never underestimate the power of clerks who don't get paid enough to hassle. </TEXT>

Amen! There's persuasive evidence across many cultures that an unwillingness to admit vulnerability is the ultimate weakness, because it effectively cuts an individual off from from the healing power of community. Conventional gender roles have placed most of the pressure to hide self-doubt and sadness on men, but it hurts everybody because we all lose the gifts of the ones who remain silent too long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, thanks. I remember that Rez Rat moment; I just didn't realize the main motivator for creating /r/IndianCountry was the /r/NativeAmerican mod's refusal to act. 

It's such a shame when an obviously-named gateway sub -- the one with the name newbies will look for -- becomes useless because of bad modding. /r/politics is the one that makes me white-hot angry on a regular basis, not because it's dominated by one political viewpoint but because the mods have decided that the definition of "politics" includes only news about elected officials and candidates. They remove anything about advocacy groups, coverage of government agencies, major cultural developments that have political implications, etc. In that case, too, there are several alternative subs, but so far none has emerged as the consensus relocation site for an all-sided consideration of politics. 

Thanks again for the explanation. I have been lazy about where I post Native news, but I'll now work harder to make sure /r/IndianCountry is at least the *first* place I put things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your mom (and others) may be interested in [this radio documentary](http://servlet1.lib.berkeley.edu:8080/audio/stream.play.logic?coll=mrc filename=intheair.mp3) about anti-war activism in that area at the time. It's just one of the many great links at [The Pacifica Radio/UC Berkeley Social Activism Sound Recording Project: Anti-Vietnam War Protests in the
San Francisco Bay Area   Beyond](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet.html)

You may also want to think about donating this poster, which is pretty rare, to an established archive like the one at [UC Irvine](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt2489r5bk/). There's also a [significant market for such posters](http://www.bolerium.com/cgi-bin/bol48/results.html?search=1 category=Posters). I've always wanted to put my collection in a university archive, but looking at those prices, I don't know if I can afford to give them away. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Species: Feline

Age: 20 years

Sex/Neuter status: F/S

Breed: DSH

Body weight: 5.6 lb.

History: CKD Stage 3

Clinical signs: bleeding at SQ injection site

Duration: three minutes until stop

Your general location: Ohio

Our elder kitty has been diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease, and has been on daily fluids for almost a year. She's doing remarkably well, staying active, eating well and accepting the ritual of being injected. But tonight blood started coming out of the injection site as soon as we finished. It was enough to freak us out, but apparently stopped after soaking just two facial  tissues. Did we do something wrong? Is she in trouble (she seems even more perky than usual today, coming and going)? Is her skin just losing elasticity, or what? I can call the vet in the morning, but any answer now would help us sleep tonight. </TEXT>

Gee, thanks. Being a vet tech -- even in a rescue hospital -- doesn't give you license to act like a jerk. 

For others who may be tempted to take this dismissal at face value, I would advise taking this user's absolute dismissal with a grain or ten of salt. Refeeding syndrome is rarely seen in vet offices except in cases of hepatic lipidosis, precisely because veterinary care costs money and the cats that come in are more likely than not to have had basically good care. In rescue work and shelters it's another story, and the caution is *always* warranted when talking to someone who just found a starving kitten and knows nothing about cats. </TEXT>

That's optimal for 7K. I try to convince people to give themselves at least 24 hrs. before starting down, but even that's a tough sell for people who don't recognize the issue. I'm glad you and your co-hikers have had no trouble, but I'm usually talking to unprepared/overeager newbies, and over the past 3 decades I've seen a lot of them felled by "mysterious" ailments that were actually predictable and preventable consequences of elevation change. And hiking with individuals who ignored the advice is not pleasant, so I keep pushing it.

I can't because this all came out in a series of posts over a couple of years to the Grand Canyon Hikers and Backpackers Yahoo group, which is great day to day but not very searchable. The one person who knows the most (because he's an MD who practiced at the Canyon) has been effectively silenced by threats of a defamation suit. But it's something to keep in mind.

Anyway, thank you for this post. You may have saved somebody's life, and certainly saved some folks' vacations.

<TEXT> You should know that a good number of experienced GC hikers have concluded that such water delivery systems are actually dangerous because they encourage the hiker to sip *too much* water, leading to the danger of hyponatremia. The manufacturer you cite is extremely aggressive about legal bullying to stop dissemination of that analysis, but after one experience of hyponatremia, I'll never stop pointing this out.

BTW, it would be a mitzvah if you would amend your original post to emphasize the danger of water intoxication and urge hikers to carry very salty snacks and use V-8 in place of energy drinks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hyponatremia -- also known as water intoxication -- is a huge, under-appreciated issue for desert hikers. Following the advice in the original post here could get you in serious trouble, because it does not address salt loss.

You're absolutely right about V-8 being the best re-hydrating drink. It has *all* the electrolytes you need, unlike sports drinks. After one experience with hyponatremia (that even a concerned Ranger didn't recognize as such) I started carrying a can of V-8 for every day in the Canyon. It's worth the weight! </TEXT>

**tl;dr** All trade unions are labor unions. There are differences in how various unions are structured (and more so every day), but all are governed by the same laws and consider each other equal partners in the struggle for workers' rights and dignity. The claim that they are "two completely separate things" is simply wrong.

Yeah, no. From the tone of your comments, you stopped caring before you started this discussion. I'm a mod elsewhere, so I know how to deal with users who break the rules. You completely failed to cushion your explanation with compassion -- and instead, accused the OP of "ignoring" you when she was merely pointing to how confusing this rule can be even when the user is not dealing with shock and grief.

You're off balance here. This exchange should have been about explaining the rules to someone who made a sincere mistake, not about spanking a naughty child. Modding is a tough job, but you really can do better than this. </TEXT>

The vet most likely had a legal obligation to treat any rabid animal the way she did Jiggie, and you could offer no assurance that it couldn't possibly be rabies, because you had allowed Jiggie to run loose. 

Some jurisdictions will allow a possibly rabid animal to live through a waiting period rather than kill it and dissect the brain (the only conclusive test), but even if your town allows this it won't matter because suing over veterinary care is something only a very wealthy person even *can* do.

The vet you went to lacks people skills, but suing won't change anything. Please just concentrate on remembering Jiggie at her strongest and best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It wasn't a police brutality protest, although many of those people are also involved in that work.

The event today was [the Ohio Student Association](http://www.ohiostudentassociation.org/end_zero_tolerance) statewide protest about zero-tolerance school discipline policies. The press advisory explaining the goals of the  demonstration is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdXbYlyHXnUwYTj08oRvvF0nD5RR6VX43XnXLqhD2wY/edit?pli=1). It will be interesting to see how this is covered on the 6:00 local news; at noon Ch. 4 managed to cover a different story from across the street from the education Department and the OSA demo was so loud it was hard to hear the reporter -- but they had no coverage of this event.

OSA is a relatively new but very impressive organization. It's part of [the Ohio Organizing Collaborative](http://www.ohorganizing.org/) which has member groups (including unions) all over the state, and an innovative approach to organizing that mobilizes and trains young people to be effective leaders in various reform struggles, including elimination of student debt.

For these reasons and more, OSA was voted the Community Festival Honored Community Organization for 2015 -- see page 15 [here](http://apgmediaofohio.com/emags/Comfest2015/index.html). </TEXT>

My theory on housework is, if the item doesn't multiply, smell, catch fire, or block the refrigerator door, let it be. No one else cares. Why should you?

<TEXT> I wouldn't give money to this nonprofit, and -- speaking as a nonprofit administrator --  I would not recommend to anyone that they do, either. 

In the first place, there's no evidence that this IS a non-profit, aside from OP's assertion. There's no website, no link to evidence of an IRS charter or even sponsorship by an existing 501(c)(3), no board of directors. Not only is there absolutely nothing to inspire confidence, but there's one huge red flag: the most developed post on the FB page is a series of photos of a particular old mansion these folks propose to "fix up for transitional housing" -- this from people who admit elsewhere that they have no idea beyond bake sales for fundraising.

And all that is just from looking at the material OP presented to *this* reddit. [The most compelling reasons why no one should give money to this group are in the answers to the disturbingly basic question the OP raised over at /r/nonprofit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/3d9m83/struggling_college_student_executive_director_of/)

OP, I think you're probably sincere. But *you need to listen* to those folks. If you really want to help, be humble enough to volunteer for the established groups already working on these issues, and learn all the things that go into nonprofit work.   </TEXT>

In this case, they left general info, but because it was not a National Park they were not required to leave an exact itinerary with Rangers. Then they took one wrong turn (despite using a good map and having skills), which led to another, which led to another ... 

... and then they did the absolute *right* thing: stop, stay together, make themselves visible from the air, ration their food. I think folks in other parts of the country who over-blame these hikers are failing to understand how difficult S R work is in terrain like Bridger-Teton.

The full video comes with full info, like where this happened, what *organization* (not random individuals) did the rescue, what happened to the puppies, and how to get in touch if you want to give the mama a home or donate money to this good work. All that got lost when the OP chose to snag this clip rather than go look for the whole thing.

Adding, this general question, having to be asked by a third party *on a Saturday*, is a nightmare. One has to wonder: how did they come to be evicted -- under a law that requires plenty of notice -- without having explored options for themselves? I'm not blaming them. I've watched folks nearing the bottom of their resources go into a glazed state and so fail to ask for help in a timely way. It just hurts to watch, every time.

Anyway, tell us more specifics, and maybe someone here can offer specific help.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> A good article, but the headline makes it sound more crass than it really is. The money the author spent was shocking to her *in retrospect*, but it's clear that she was deciding on the basis of love (as she understood it then) as things went along and only noticing the financial cost later ... when she also belatedly recognized the cost in pain these treatments caused Kitty, and admitted having prioritized her own feelings above Kitty's well-being.

The decision to euthanize a beloved pet is always agonizing, and this author seems to have arrived at a better than average standard for making such decisions. Thanks to the OP for sharing that, and for opening up this discussion here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I wonder if vets would allow me to post on their boards even if I'm not a customer? 

Yes, they probably will. As for places that will take 6 cats: probably no landlord will go for this. And that's why millions of renters lie about how many cats they have. As long as your rent is paid on time, and the cats aren't stinky or noisy, most landlords will choose an otherwise good tenant over the hassle of eviction and starting over to find a new tenant. I do think 6 in an apartment is probably too many for their sake, but if you haven't re-homed some/all of them by the time you move maybe you can keep them while you continue to look for new homes.

Offering one cat at a time really is best. Include some details about the cat's personality: what kind of toys it likes, what silly things it does, how it interacts with others, etc. Emphasize that there is a deadline (even if it's not firm) and that you're being slightly picky about who you'll allow to have your kitty. People are more likely to respond to the implied challenge of "are you good enough to adopt this particular wonderful cat?" than they are to the implied carelessness of "I've got too many cats -- want one?" 

Good luck!

<TEXT> Buying boots this close to the hike is not a good idea: they could not possibly be broken in before you start. OTOH, sneakers won't cut it. You should immediately buy a pair of trail runners or lowcut hiking shoes -- something that has serious tread and arch/ankle support, but will break in fast. Merrell has some shoes that don't require long break-in; Hi-Tec specializes in shoes that are wearable right out of the box (but don't last for as long as others).

More important is that this question raises another question: whether you've bitten off more than you can chew here. How accustomed are you to long-distance hiking? How strong are your knees? Have you backpacked much? Do you live at sea level? All of these questions are important, and if you give us more detail we can give you more help.

Two points that will help, no matter what your experience:  
(1) remember to cut your toenails before starting out; and
(2) you can make the whole trip easier by sending your pack and tent down and up again by mule. It costs $68.42 each way and is totally worth it. If you decide to use the [mule duffel service](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/phantom-ranch/duffel-services/) just on way, make it the downhill trip. That's much harder than the uphill, especially if you're going down the Kaibab and up BA.

<TEXT> Quaaludes -- also called "sopors" -- are a soporific (sleeping pill) that had a sudden rush of popularity in the early 70s as a recreational drug, with a very significant usage as a date-rape drug. 

There was a theory advanced by radical anti-war activists (mainly Yippies and the underground press, starting from Ann Arbor) that there was government involvement in the sudden widespread street-level availability of such "death drugs" -- as opposed to pot and LSD -- intended to blunt the rising popular opposition to the Viet Nam war and the recession. 

[Here is a 1973 article about the national anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689), showing the "WAKE UP! No more sleeping pills in our community" graphic that appeared on thousands of T-shirts and millions of posters that year. And [here is a history of Quaaludes](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329) published that same year by Rolling Stone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the headline here is a quote from the subject of this article, but as a headline it's tone deaf: most of the new social energy around climate change is coming from precisely "faith-based arguments that deal with climate change" -- from the opposite direction. When the Pope issued his Encyclical last week calling for a moral campaign against human-made climate change, he was standing on the base built over the past few years by many other religious leaders who say stewardship of the planet is a basic responsibility for people of faith. So this headline is just seriously odd, not to mention confusing.

<TEXT> First, thank you for taking care of these kitties. You've done a good thing, and trolls can't change that.

Some questions:  
How old are they? Are they all neutered and vaccinated?    
Have your posts included photos? Have you advertised them all together, or separately? 
Have you posted to other local reddits, including school-specific ones?
How fast do you have to move on this? Is there an external pressure, or is it just time to move them along?

I don't have any magic trick. In my experience (I re-homed dozens of kittens over several years in another city), it comes down to sheer persistence and highlighting each cat individually. For leaflets and online posts, a good portrait photo plus a compelling back story helps. I've also gone to the extreme of taking the kittens to a place where they would be seen -- the parking lot of a gourmet grocery store or a popular restaurant on a Saturday afternoon -- and letting people hold them, which increases attraction exponentially. (I wouldn't hand them over permanently at first contact. Anyone interested in adopting would have to come by the next day and go through the interview.) 

You're doing the right things. Keep on keeping on with those, and keep asking for more help. In my experience, friends and family will make one perfunctory effort when you first ask, but it's only when you become relentless that something finally works. Don't be afraid of being the squeaky wheel!

Yes, it is. Just like very other aspect of the deceased's life that is now theirs to sort out -- but more so, because this "heirloom" is alive and sentient. They had a responsibility to try harder to place the cat, at least in a foster home, before dumping it at a kill shelter. </TEXT>

Adding, the events that cause people to dump cats are almost never as sudden as the dumpers make them out to be. They just chose to ignore signs and refused to make contingency plans, then plead necessity where little of that actually exists. </TEXT>

Spend the time to recruit another family for him. It's doable; it just takes more time than people like this consider convenient. If they have to part ways with the cat immediately, they could place him in a foster home, then continue to work on finding a permanent placement. This goes on every day, where cat owners bother to think through their "sudden problem" and thus realize that others have  faced the same challenges before and found answers.  </TEXT>

That's your choice, because it's your family. But plenty of other families are built differently, on the belief that it's better to encounter and explain difference and diversity than to pretend children can be "protected" from things that require the parents to think hard and talk carefully. For those parents, and there are more of them every day, Community Festival *is* family friendly.

Adding, people who love to hate ComFest keep circulating claims about degenerate activities happening there that nobody who works the entire fest every year has *ever* encountered. Remember, organizers have to answer to the CPD, the neighbors and the insurance company, so we log every single bad incident and discuss them all in a public meeting. 

There are always a lot of rumors floating around, but the malicious lies are just ridiculous. If even 0.01% of them were true, the City would never let the festival happen. Instead, what happens is that police officers compete for a chance to work the fest, because *this is the safest event of its size in central Ohio*. 

Maybe it's time to pick a target for your rage that is actually guilty of something you can document.

Tell that to the hundreds of families bring their kids to ComFest every year and rave about it.  Your view is obviously based on rumor and never exploring the whole fest.

Community Festival has a hugely popular KidsART program, which begins with kids designing entries for a contest to choose their own version of the official volunteer T-shirt (the design this year was awesome). Older children teach younger kids to make tie-dye; musicians teach songs and  how to play instruments, and the ComFest Museum exhibit is always packed with wide-eyed kids listening to docents.

You should come back next year with an open mind. You'll eat your words, no doubt about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I might have used "nibbling"-- but really, the concern was that this post might get deleted by mods for *sounding like* what they call "sad content", which of course it isn't. As for getting more eyeballs on it: /r/aww is always a crapshoot because the volume of submissions is massive. A great photo can go nowhere while a blurry cellphone snapshot gets lots of upvotes, and title doesn't seem to be as important as time of day, in my experience.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You think *you're* disgusted by the change? Ask anybody who was old enough to see the previous tenant evicted. [Tradewinds](http://www.columbusart.com/artscene/tradewinds.html) was the original campus area source for all those things plus import clothing and furnishings, gifts and alternative reading, from underground comics to underground newspapers. Both ComFest and the Columbus Free Press (in its earlier, saner incarnation) had deep roots in Tradewinds, whose female owners made all kinds of of street people, marginal characters, rebels and goofballs feel welcome. The demise of Tradewinds was considered by many area residents as the last straw in the University Partners takeover, the end of an era of independent shops along High near OSU. Students now can't begin to imagine what a  vibrant, creative scene existed there, and it's a damn shame.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, the day of the week thing cinches it. The year not appearing on the leaflet itself is actually pretty common for the mid-70s. I still recall a fairly large demo for which the first print run failed to include any date at all -- it's hard now to imagine being so wrapped up in the moment and the issue that one could make such a mistake, but it happened a lot in the heat of the times.

Thanks for making the effort to sort out my confusion about this one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I saw that -- but that's for a different leaflet, about a campaign that went on for many years. And it includes the kind of design and production that jibes with 1976, which is noticeably different from those in the OP's linked poster. YAWF always had a very recognizable graphic style, which became more sophisticated as they went along. The OP's link shows the later style with less text and larger graphics, but retains the use of Cooper Black typeface, so it can't be *very* far into the 80s, but I still think this is a later piece from the same campaign, not one from the first year of the campaign.

Of course, the simplest thing to do would be to ask the organization itself, which still exists as [The Party for Liberation and Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Socialism_and_Liberation) -- or better yet, ask some of the people involved at that time. Trying to figure things like this out without the participation of the people who were there at the time is just silly. This isn't really ancient history, and they're a great living resource. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry to seem rude, but I have to ask: if you know so little about the region and its people that you have to throw this very basic question out to a bunch of strangers, what makes you qualified to write for publication on this subject? Do you have any idea how many books are published every year on this subject by people with deep, longstanding ties to the subject? I'm guessing not, because you haven't cited any of them, including the ones that list the very info you seek here.

As an editor, I would turn down this pitch in a New York second. Unless this is headed for a vanity press (where the author pays the publisher), I don't see any book that starts out this way being publishable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **UPDATE 3 PM** 

Ground at Bozo, Gazebo, Solar and Live Arts stages   Peace Village has been deemed too fragile to reopen those venues.

All workshops   Honoree Awards Ceremony cancelled. Bozo bands are at Park St. Salon; Gazebo bands are at Park St. Patio

There aint no party like the party with a purpose cuz the party with a purpose dont stop  Cmon down! 

-------------------------------------
Original post:

The rain damaged the park, but not as badly as last year thanks to festival participants who heeded requests to spare the turf. Here's the story as of this morning:

*ALL Street Fair vendors are open for business  
*ALL beer booths are open for business  
*All Volunteers are asked to report at their scheduled times   
*JAZZ stage and OFF RAMP Stage are both open as scheduled    
*GAZEBO stage acts are appearing at Park Street Tavern  

Site leadership will reassess the situation between 2 and 3 PM and will announce then what arrangements have been made for bands and acts scheduled for other stages. Watch this space for updates, or check [our Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/ComFest).

<TEXT> Remember those insufficiently stringent campaign finance laws? They're stringent enough to make something like this a major headache. Better read up on reporting, limits, bundling, etc.

And best to let the campaign organization itself lead on fundraising, IMO. They don't need well-intentioned but under-informed supporters creating situations that have even the appearance of impropriety while they're trying to run the most principled presidential fundraising operation in history.

<TEXT> The FBI and DoJ distinction between homegrown and domestic terrorism is a political creation and should be ended. The homegrown classification locates Muslims as foreign agents operating in the U.S., not as part of the social fabric of this country. The portrayal of U.S. Muslims as potential or actual representatives of global jihad is used to justify the denial of constitutional protections and leads to representing ordinary menasking religious questions, criticizing the U.S. government, or even going camping with their friendsas a threat to society. It is past time to apply the same constitutional protections to everyone, and develop a response to terrorism based in analysis of patterns of violence instead of political costs and benefits.

That's because the working federal definition of terrorism was reworked twice since then, and for most of that time domestic terrorism was not so defined, nor an enforcement priority. Events have required a course correction, and it now is recognized for what it always has been. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This was a lone wolf type of crime, not a group or movement

"Lone wolf" crimes committed by white supremacists absolutely are part of a movement. This tactic was popularized by KKK leader Louis Beam in the 1980s as an extension of the "leaderless resistance" strategy proposed in the 1960s by Col. Ulius Louis Amoss to fight the alleged communist takeover of the US. In recent years the term has been extended almost beyond meaning by sloppy use in the popular press. But it is understood both by its adherents and by anti-terrorism LEOs as meaning exactly what it always meant: a paper-thin veneer of "plausible deniability" meant to conceal the existence of a white supremacist movement waging war on democratic rights.

Thre is a ton of material available online about this, but [here's a primer](http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/terrorism/insurgency/leaderless-resistance.html). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some things to keep in mind: there are multiple agencies involved in policing this event, not all of which are willing to meet with organizers in advance, not all of which have the same priorities about what to police. Big props are due to the CPD, who overall do a great job. Last year, there was miscommunication about how to close in the middle of a downpour, complicated by a rumor (untrue) that an officer had been attacked. That won't happen again.

Also, remember that most of these citations and arrests are for really egregious violations of state laws, and many are for illegal drinking.
On the numbers *and* in the view of police, ComFest is consistently one of the safest major public events in Columbus. 

Those who are seriously concerned about policing should come to the Solar Stage at 4:55 PM Saturday for a workshop on police accountability, featuring organizers of the campaign for a civilian review board along with several attorneys who have spent decades representing victims of police misconduct -- and a retired CPD officer with long experience at ComFest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You clearly have no idea how much money and hard work the festival organization does in Goodale Park -- planting trees, flowers and grass; upgrading the electric grid; helping to pay for bike stands and the fountain, etc. The park wouldn't be half as nice if ComFest hadn't spent the last 34 years working on it. Ask Friends Of Goodale Park if they want it gone. Ask any of the business groups in the area if they want it gone. 

Every year, the festival organizers have to get local residents to sign off on the permit -- and what that shows is that your opinion is in the tiny minority of whiners; most local residents love the fest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, every newspaper gets that sort of complaints from readers. Most major dailies don't answer such crank complaints in front of the whole readership, under the editor's name, on the front page of the second section, week after week after week. This column has been an embarrassment for the Dispatch for years -- it makes the paper sound like a small town weekly, and shows Marrison as unbelievably thin-skinned.

The new editor, Alan Miller, may not continue this tradition, but brings other baggage. He's  a careerist, and so insecure that he once used his position as head of the Ohio Legislative Correspondents Association to ban reporters from alternative weeklies  -- who had been eating the Dispatch's lunch at professional awards ceremonies -- from the Statehouse press room.

We're farther than ever from having the paper Columbus needs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before you take the word of the single most negative troll in this subreddit, do yourself a favor and read about Community Festival. 

This is the fest that has won so many awards for "best festival in central Ohio" that the paid staff of other fests joke about giving ComFest an all-time award and taking it out of contention just to give others a chance. It's the fest that annually motivates 1,700 volunteers to work for free running six stages with over 250 performances and workshops. It's the organization that gives thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of labor to keep Goodale Park green and blooming, and leaves the park pristine when the fest is over (unlike virtually every other festival in town). These are the folks who take nothing for themselves but give back profits from the event as grants to dozens of community organizations. 

You can read what the organization does,and why, at [the ComFest website](http://comfest.com), and find plenty of praise for the event just by searching for past news coverage. But the best way to learn how wrong the OP is would be to just come on down to this free event next weekend. You can find all the details about transportation, hours, performances, etc in the [2015 Community Festival Program Guide](http://www.comfest.com/program-guide.php), and read about the fest's history in the [40th anniversary commemorative book published in 2012](http://athensmessenger.com/app/emag/ComfestXL/ComfestXL.swf).

EDIT: removed true but tangential statement about OP in order to keep the focus where it belongs. </TEXT>

Since it's June, and millions of  teenage redditors have nothing better to do, they decided this was an unconscionable betrayal of reddit's supposed function as a free speech forum, and issued a call to arms against the admins.

It's a great way to meet people. The main First Aid station is located in the center of the park, so he'd get to talk to all sorts of people passing by, not just the sick ones.

<TEXT>  If you can't score a permit for the main corridor campgrounds you could also try to get a permit for one of the other camping areas on other less popular trails that head down into the canyon.

This is not a good idea for any first-timer, let alone one who hasn't managed to locate the basic info about the Canyon. You correctly hiked the corridor trails, which should be the first step for any hiker.

Also, a lot has changed since 2008, including very prominently the demand for permits and the system for getting them. The increase in visitors is qualitative, with people showing up by the dozens or even hundreds to hike or run the corridor. There is so much demand now that there is serious consideration being given to instituting fees for every hiker who steps below the rim, whether they camp overnight or not. 

The answer to this is not for first-timers to try even the easiest of the lesser-known, less populated trails.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, you need a permit, and no, you don't have much chance of getting one at this point. Permits for October (a prime weather time) are already gone, having been grabbed up a month ago. There is a slight possibility that you could catch a cancellation, but you're going to be doing the corridor, and those are the most popular sites, so it's a very, very slight chance.

I'd offer more hope, but frankly it doesn't sound like you've done much thinking or research about this. How hard can it be to read the official website for the park, where all this is laid out in user-friendly fashion? I'm sorry to sound harsh, but what you're talking about is not a stroll in the park.

Go read the official website and check out kaibab.org, then come back and tell us more about your level of fitness, backpacking experience, etc. Then we can help you.

<TEXT> Your premise is deeply flawed, so it's really not possible to answer. Some people don't like jazz, just as some people don't like rock or hiphop or classical music. But there's no evidence of any large number of people who *hate* jazz. The account you linked to seems designed to troll, for what reason nobody knows. In any case, that's one person,not a trend. </TEXT>

Not every first timer is a nitwit. Some take the time to read about what they plan to do, and ask those more experienced. Just because this mass audience article doesn't speak to you doesn't mean that it won't speak to others who would otherwise have continued as nitwits.

After 20 years hiking GCNP, I'm always glad to see this kind of preventive outreach, no matter how clumsy the style. *Any* such effort beats having to intercept unprepared hikers at the trailhead to try to convince them not to go ahead on a hike that *will* result in having to send SAR after them later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're going to be concerned about human trafficking, it's a good idea to double check any stats you read. The overwhelming majority of humans trafficked are *not* sex workers but agricultural, industrial or domestic workers. The reason you see so much about sex trafficking (which is a real but much smaller problem) is because the loudest voices on this are evangelical Christian groups that frame the issue in ways that serve their mission. Some of these evangelical groups write about the issue in a way that intentionally blurs a reader's understanding of which numbers are for all trafficking and which are for sex trafficking

Most NGOs working on the issue of human trafficking reject the model used by these groups, which focus on "rescue" of individuals (almost always women) rather than focusing on changing the economic inequality that forces people into sexual [or other] slavery. 

So please take this *whole* issue as seriously as it deserves, and be sure to read the critiques of those who were working on the big picture before American evangelicals saw their opportunity to use this one aspect to raise money and recruit well-intentioned suburban teenagers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Be careful: a social media call to fool around with your employer's  FB rating by embellishing the story could backfire. You've given more than enough info here for someone -- the jerks or your boss or IHOP corporate -- to identify your real name, and you can't assume none of those people reads reddit. You also can't assume that IHOP would condone that behavior, which (since you're one of their managers) could look like IHOP is doing it, possibly in violation of FB's TOS.

Much better to get in front of this by telling the story from your point of view, in writing, to your immediate supervisor or district manager. If you can get a copy of the police incident report,great -- if this takes time, tell them you've asked for it already. That alone will help protect you from blowback you don't deserve. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  more and more jobs are being taken up because of increases in automation

The problem isn't advertising or automation. The problem is concentration of ownership into the hands of a few megacorps that have zero commitment to journalistic values and demand an unrealistically high ROI -- thus, the decimation of editorial staffers, starting with the ones whose work took a long time and cost a lot of money.

ProPublica is great -- but you do understand, I hope, that its existence came about because there were so many old-school journos without jobs. It was almost the only success out of hundreds of efforts to build something new. What happened is basically that the megacorps outsourced serious reporting to foundations, leaving reporters without *ongoing* and (relatively) secure institutional support. The new organizations employ a tiny fraction of the available talent and publish an equally tiny fraction of the serious news that used to get published. 

You can't see the difference because you can't see the work that is no longer even getting started anymore, but I've been in the business for longer than most redditors have been alive and the scale of what's no longer investigated -- especially at the local/state level -- is horrifying.

Anyway, the idiot mods here have decided that this post is off-topic because it isn't "explicitly about current US politics", so if you want to comment further, you'll need to go to one of the other postings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't say "what they think is the right thing". I said, and meant, the [objectively] right thing -- the action that is sustainable within the ecology of human society.

The point is that most people, psychopaths and sociopaths excepted, are both hard-wired and conditioned to want to be fair and compassionate. When some fail to do this, it's a lack of resources -- material or knowledge -- that causes the problem. The idea that it's only natural to compete is so reductionist as to be completely misleading. When public policy is based on that assumption we get massive wealth inequality and wars to protect the system that made some people so much richer than others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the VT ACLU has been keeping watch on police misconduct in Burlington, if you're still there.

Remember, different cities have different histories. What we're all really looking for is an overview of best practices, and of best strategies for getting there. My city had a long history of lefty lawyers suing the City for $$$$ over individual incidents, plus a lot of agitation from white radicals who are anti-cop, without much changing. Then 20 years ago it got so bad the Justice Department almost took over the police department, before reaching an agreement with the City that had the effect of forcing a big jump ahead on things like training. We're still struggling, but at a different starting level than other cities, even those in the same state.

But I have another question: why is this discussion in this reddit? I love Bernie, but I'm unaware of his laser-focused economic populism campaign taking on an agenda for building an all-sided progressive movement. He almost certainly agrees on the importance of this issue, but the task at hand is a campaign for office.  </TEXT>

Hoot was a [humor magazine](http://www.columbuslibrary.org/cmlcnix/searchresults.cfm?sort= afterdate= beforedate= searchlist=OSLIN%2C%20IRV%20%28%60HOOT%27%20MAGAZINE%29 searchindex=S pub=ALL) founded by local writer [Irv Oslin](https://irvoslin.wordpress.com/), who also wrote a weekly column full of epic snark for Columbus Guardian. After a hilarious but tragically failed run for Mayor of Columbus and the collapse of CG, he moved to Ashland and became a serious reporter.

<TEXT> I'm not objecting to the amount of punishment, but the *kind*: do you want to live in a society where judges can tell reporters to write articles to the judge's specification? 

Journalists are watching this to see what the news org will do, and what the editor will do. Both *should* refuse this sentence, but the editor in question is a widely-despised hack and will probably cave. 

I have no idea what an appropriate conventional sentence would be. The guy violated a very clear court order, in an egregious manner. And this wasn't for any reason of high principle, just the reflexive race to get a scoop. What do you think?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this post, which is about 100% more informative than anything the Dispatch itself has published, and way more important than most of the posts here lately about any subject. Love or hate the Dispatch, it still has huge influence on the overall public understanding of what constitutes news in Columbus.

The graf below, describing what happened at the ProJo, succinctly describes the central issue with concentration of newspaper ownership into the hands of a few corporations that care more about the bottom line than the public good:

...many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom...

"Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters.

The guy they say will take over, Jason Taylor from Gannett, has most recently been running the Chattanooga Times Free Press and the Jackson (MS) Clarion-Ledger. Neither paper has suffered big staff cuts AFAIK, but I'm reserving judgment until I hear back from friends who work at those papers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My thoughts, exactly. This is *not* uplifting news.

Anybody who thinks you're too negative or over-reacting needs to know that this year, 2015, has been called the "crunch year" by climate scientists -- the last chance to even slow down the destruction of our home planet. In light of that, a "business decision" to slowly taper off production and use up the bad ingredient can be seen for what it is: the immoral acceptance of the amoral dictates of capitalism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What does this even mean? 

The way corporate owners control coverage is by *not* covering things that should be reported -- and there's no way for most reporters to effectively counter that. So they cover what they can, as ethically as they can, and so manage to at least feed their kids. The news industry has changed so much in the last 20 years that you could staff a hundred good news orgs with the reporters who have been fired for objecting to the new regime.

Be glad that there are still people trying to do it right.

This. Reddit is not "a free speech initiative". It's a business. It's nowhere near dying. A lot of 15 year olds are bent out of shape because ... they're 15 years old. 

It's entirely possible to spend an entire day (or night) on reddit right now without even knowing about this "scandal". I know about it because I subscribe to /r/announcements, but the other 50 or so subreddits I visit haven't even noticed the "uproar".

If you're bothering to read /r/all, stop. It's a piss-poor substitute for the combination of good subscriptions plus use of the "random" button. And SRD is a cesspool to be avoided at all costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hedges and others are smart enough to recognize that if there isn't a peaceful revolution there will be violent chaos.

But not apparently smart enough to take the lesson that a "revolutionary moment" is when the people's resistance has the capacity to manage the earthquake of global economic disaster, not just when old systems and structures are failing. That term has a specific meaning, and this isn't it. 

To only point  to the objective conditions without assessing the subjective factor -- organized strategic resistance -- is to raise false hopes of a shortcut that doesn't require the tedium of base-building. If those false hopes lead self-declared revolutionaries to assume there's a mass movement at their backs when there isn't one, the result will be worse than ugly.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah ... no. There's a reason why the leaders of the New Left summed up the main error of 60s and 70s as having believed *that* was "a revolutionary moment". Until there is a unified movement capable of both strategic planning and logistical resilience, the only thing going on here is temptation to take shortcuts.

There is a real danger in this moment from the agitators on the left and the right who wrongly think that it's enough to "bring chaos", after which everything will sort itself out. Such a scenario would default to the right, but probably not the way some of them assume. Preventing that is probably the most urgent task; leading a revolution is rather more than the left can do, especially in the US.

<TEXT> Thank you! I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but right away you can see the type of seats my friend and I got -- right at field level, behind a low railing -- and even see another girl get the same treatment my friend got. I can't wait to see if we're in this film!

Adding, I can already see it includes ["the fifth Beatle", radio DJ Murray the K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_the_K#.22The_Fifth_Beatle.22), whose "Swingin' Soiree" show on WINS in New York was the soundtrack we listened to every night on [first-generation transistor radios](http://www.mcrfb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1963-Teen-Girl-Listening-to-Transistor-Radio.jpg) when our parents thought we were studying or sleeping. Murray the K was referred to by some parents (not mine) as "Moral Decay", and blamed for fanning the flames of Beatlemania. The idea that the Beatles' music was just that good was lost on a lot of older folks then. 

Fortunately, my parents knew enough about music to appreciate both the roots and the innovation that made the band sound so new. My mother even bought herself a four-inch diameter button to wear that said "I love Ringo!", and although they didn't attend, they bought me and my brother tickets and drove us to Shea. It was an unforgettable gift.

BTW, the classmate I went with climbed over the railing in front of us to try to storm the stage (we had GREAT seats), but was grabbed and pushed back onto her seat by stadium security. I don't think she even paused in her screaming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Columbus Guardian* was a better paper, for the short time it existed. It had serious reporters, serious attitude and Irv Oslin, FFS. 

Even *Alive!* was a better paper than *TOP* until *Alive!* stopped covering local news in 1988. Hell, even *Hoot!* was a better paper than TOP, whose business model boiled down to pissing people off to guarantee newsstand pick-up greater than the skin ads alone brought in.

And the FreePress has been squatting space that should be taken by something better grounded ever since it went cuckoo for chemtrails. The Black Box voting obsession didn't help their credibility -- or that of saner organizations that affiliate with them for lack of any other general purpose progressive outlet.

Anyway, I don't see *The Dispatch* coverage changing much. The news hole is so small already that it *can't* change much, and they don't need to feed readers' inevitable resentment against the interlopers even one minute sooner than absolutely necessary. I'm guessing the new owners will tweak the peripheral businesses before they change the flagship publication, drawing out the advantage of reflexive reader loyalty to the familiar format while they study the market up close.

<TEXT> Civility is *everything* in an anonymous online forum. This is where we get to make up our own rules, which are based on what we want to get out of the experience. 

Reddit allows for thousands of places where users can be brutal to each other if they want. But this is the subreddit that represents Columbus to the world, and it *can* be the kind of ideal neighborhood almost nobody ever gets to live in IRL: respectful of others' choices, supportive of others' needs, irreverent enough to laugh at ourselves, passionate about the future of our common homeplace.

Civility until unjustly attacked is a pretty good standard.

<TEXT>  That's not a personal attack. She's a pretty shitty poster. Everything she posts is either uninteresting, self-promotional or has been posted a dozen times before.

Are you listening to yourself? Of course that's a personal attack. If one user's posts are so annoying that you're willing to go round up 18 citations to her posts -- four of those from other subreddits, and three of *those* from another state -- it's well beyond a discussion of why people in this subreddit, in general, seem to downvote everything, from anybody.

If you want to critique a certain style of using reddit, fine. I'd probably agree with you about this style -- not because there are a lot of similar pleas for help that could/should be found independently through simple searches, but because there aren't any posts contributing important local information or art or opportunities. It's a very selfish way to approach a public forum, let alone a community. I thinks it is a style deserves criticism, because if it becomes the norm it undercuts the usefulness, never mind the enjoyability, of the forum.

*[donewaiting.com, I'm looking at you.]*

Anyway: did you notice that I did not actually name the annoying poster in the comments above? That's giving the offender room to gracefully absorb the criticism and decide to change, without making their entire existence the issue and the target for the everybody who wanders by.

I wrote long here for the same reason you went out and researched those posts: both of us want a better /r/Columbus. We might not agree on what that means, but could we please agree to try to minimize targeting individuals this way?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you remember that with such vivid (and appropriate) bitterness, you probably also remember the brief, golden moment when Columbus readers benefited from the competition between *three* weekly alternative papers -- Alive! and Columbus Guardian being the others.

And as for bad moments in journalism: the out-of-state owners of Columbus Guardian *pulped the archives* on their way out of town, which is why many here may not remember that award-winning paper. That move was especially galling because it came on the heels of learning that those publishers, who had lured experienced reporters here from much bigger papers on the promise that they'd be on the cutting edge of the move to digital, had never bothered to digitize the archives. All that lofty talk about reclaiming serious journalism, and it turned out they were all about the widgets. </TEXT>

Then it turned out that such papers had to compete in the same economy as those owned by soulless conglomerates with no commitment to traditional journalistic principles. That should have been predictable, but our hope was fed by desperation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One irony here is that 20 years ago, when concentration of ownership in print media was just starting to decimate the ranks of working reporters, journalists around the country were telling each other that family-owned papers, of which the Dispatch was the prime example, were the last hope for serious news reporting. Then it turned out that such papers had to compete in the same economy as those owned by soulless conglomerates with no commitment to traditional journalistic principles. That should have been predictable, but our hope was fed by desperation.  </TEXT>

The answer is "not yet". Somebody needs to take responsibility in every town and city to start a local campaign, and that involves ordering, prepaying for, and distributing/re-selling these at cost. Why wait to start that? If this campaign isn't about grassroots organizing, it's nothing. </TEXT>

Except in this case it did. 

And in my experience, that's pretty normal -- while willingness to make a meaningful apology is still very rare. For instance, you've now called me an "asshole" and such several times *without explaining what you mean*, and you show no inkling that this might be something that merits apology. If you can articulate what you mean, and apologize for name calling, we might have something to talk about. But even then, I'd have no idea who I'm talking to because you've erased your user history by changing names. For all anybody knows, you're one of the trolls who've been treating me unfairly for years here. Nobody has any basis to judge whether you're somebody whose criticisms are worth the time to read.

So unless you're ready to apologize for being overharsh and unspecific, we're done here. </TEXT>

Thanks for your reply. I never meant to be rude but I was careless in my phrasing. I'm glad and proud that Columbus finally passed this law -- that's what I was trying to convey, but the way I said it completely undercut the intent.

You should also know that this sub has a reputation for being so brutal that it once was near the top of the list in a discussion of most toxic local reddits, and that in particular that I have a small posse of haters who downvote and disparage almost anything I say. That doesn't account for all the critical comments-- some were right on target about how unwelcoming my original comment was -- but a couple of those people hate me so much they'll come into a thread on /r/aww to snarl at me. So it's not all about this discussion.

Anyway, I hope you find what you're seeking here, and add that the weekly "Bar Thursday" gatherings listed in /r/ColumbusSocial are reportedly very friendly. I won't be there, because I don't feel welcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Review-Journal is unfortunately Nevada's largest newspaper, but the more reputable choice is the Las Vegas Sun.

What would be excellent is if you could never let anybody forget the Colebrook story, and Suprynowicz's role in its aftermath. The attacks happened before most people understood the danger of lone wolves motivated by Sovereign Citizen crackpottery, so a lot of people wrote it off as a singular event with no political significance. (It was also the week Princess Diana was killed, and that ate the newshole almost everywhere outside the affected local area.) But Supryowicz took this horror, turned it upside down and spent years touring the backwaters of the US using his book to mobilize anti-government RW crazies. 

More people should know about the reflexive heroism of another newspaper editor, Dennis Joos, who threw himself on Drega when he attacked the newspaper office. Joos was killed trying to save his staff and friends. The local library is now named for him.

All of which is by way of saying, too late, that deleting this post might not have been the best choice -- although I understand the logic. </TEXT>

The new law applies only to enclosed areas. As that term is defined, however, it includes more than just indoor spaces. Decks or patios that are covered overheadby a roof or even umbrellas or awningsand on more than two sides are also enclosed under the law. Smoking is not allowed if members of the public are invited or allowed into these areas, or if anyone works there as an employee, an independent contractor, or even as a volunteer. Business owners still have the option of making their entire facilities non smoking, both indoors and out.

<TEXT>  Don't think they have the revolutionary drive to support massive change for their workers.

And they won't until there's more engagement and education within the unions -- which are, after all, pretty much all there is in terms of a class-conscious infrastructure in the US. Remember, unions have been the money and mobilizing force behind major struggles for civil rights and against unjust wars.

[Teamsters for a Democratic Union](https://www.tdu.org/) will be an important ally if you do get into this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Alley Cat Allies](http://www.alleycat.org/Kittens) can help you with every step of the decision, from assessing their age and degree of socialization to building an outdoor shelter or finding a rescue org. They can even help you [find out who in your area is working with feral cats](http://www.alleycat.org/FeralFriends), which may lead you to the individual who is feeding them. (Because this is dubiously legal in some municipalities, they may be working at night.)

You could also try posting in your local and state reddit communities to ask how to contact local feral cat caretakers.

One thing you can do immediately is make sure they have access to clean water. Sometimes feral cats are fed, but not given water -- and that's a big deal.

There are many, many people doing this work, all of whom will be happy to help. Good on you for wanting to help, and good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's part of the problem. There are union democracy movements particular to many national unions, but most don't have a high enough profile to reach down to the local rank and file unless there happens to be a member who has wide general knowledge of and interest in unionism in general. Some such groups, like Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) have been so well-established for so long that they have actually wrought major changes. I'd suggest that anyone who is a union member should go looking for their union's rank and file oppositionists, because there usually is help to be found. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That is their job. they have to defend every single worker.

No it isn't, and no they don't. Not all complaints are legitimate greivances; the job of the union steward is to sort them out and decide whether/when to file a grievance.

The biggest problem workers have with unions is foot-dragging on filing and aggressively pursuing grievances. The most annoying problem for unions is members who don't bother to read the damn contract and thus either don't bother to seek redress or do so for ridiculous complaints.

<TEXT> [Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) is essentially the faction within the Democratic Party that doesn't want Clinton to be the nominee. They are not the problem. 

Many PACs serve a legitimate purpose and do good work. Super PACs, which don't have to disclose who their donations come from, are the biggest part of the problem. The "Ready for Bernie"/"Bet on Bernie" PAC is another sort of problem: they disclose, but although they claim to be supporting Sanders, there's no way to tell whether the uses they put donations to are helpful to his campaign.

I say "they" when referring to this PAC (which is a hybrid form, but not a Super PAC), but right now [there's no reason to think it's more than one person, with unclear motive.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crql9z6)

<TEXT> There is, but it's not what you think. 

The PAC is real, and apparently registered with the Federal Elections Commission. That doesn't mean its existence has the approval of the Sanders campaign. 

This PAC, which is in no way connected to the Sanders campaign, is the project of a middle aged lobbyist named [Carey L. Peterson](https://sites.google.com/site/caryleepetersonprofilearticle/). 

From a quick survey of this lobbyists' history and other projects, he appears to be a political entrepreneur -- he's in it for the money. I don't see anything that suggests he's a true believer, and sending money to this PAC is not a good idea.

EDIT: [**Here's an article from Bernie's hometown paper that explains this PAC.**](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/30/sanders-unable-superpacs/28184005/)

Yes, and how that happened deserves a lot more attention.

OP, while you're doing background research, be sure to look into the movement that *preceded* second-wave feminism: Women's Liberation. Based in an internationalist, class-based analysis, this is a perspective that simply could not ever be warped into the grotesque caricature that academics made of feminism. And the women who considered themselves part of a global women's liberation movement were the ones who shook the world in the late 60s/early 70s. </TEXT>

Oh, come on. You went backpacking with *strangers*, not friends. With friends it's a kind of fun your non-backpacking friends can never even dream of. Especially when you plan a big trip that takes months to jointly plan and prepare, which can be the best part of any trip. </TEXT>

That's a major dynamic in *all* conspiracy theories. Overwhelmingly scary things seem to require overwhelmingly big singular explanations -- compound dynamics and "we don't know yet" don't cut it.

<TEXT> ...  a reporter is considering doing a brief news story that might negatively portray one of the sponsor companies and the company prefers they minimize coverage...

I don't know how much of a problem media corruption is...

The kind of corruption you cite is infinitely less common than you imagine. The vast majority of reporters and editors in serious news organizations are honest. The problems you see are primarily due to the model of journalism being practiced: a blind belief in "objectivity through balance" combined with a skewed agenda favoring what readers want to consume rather than what they need to know, all dialed up to 11 by the concentration of ownership that happened over the past twenty years. Investigative teams all over the country were disbanded and defunded as marketing experts convinced the new beancounters to chase reader/viewer eyeballs with increasingly salacious clickbait.

This isn't something that's going to be fixed anytime soon -- especially not by non-journalists after the main players have spent two decades trying to figure it out.  So focusing on this instead of on-the-ground organizing would be a serious mistake.

<TEXT> I thought this was an interesting intellectual debate -- until I learned more about the "poet" in question. As a *real* poet informed me after I stupidly Tweeted this story without researching further,

Place is a white conceptual artist and lawyer who has published the documents (all of them) from a criminal case and called it poetry. She wrote in Joel Chandler Harris dialect, and her appropriation of this has been the subject of extensive debate. She says, "Authorship doesn't matter. Content doesn't master. Form doesn't master. Meter doesn't matter. All that matters is the trace of poetry."

So the answer is, no, tweeting GWTW doesn't make this poet racist. That ship sailed long ago: she was a consolidated, intentionally provocative racist long before this project.

EDIT: ...and damn the Daily Beast for omitting that critical context.

Getting rid of [conspiracism](http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/conspiracism.html) will also require dealing with people like [Bob Fitrakis](http://fraudbusterbob.com/blog/2013/01/03/call-it-by-its-real-name-chemtrails-harvard-prof-calls-for-spraying-to-re-freeze-the-arctic/), a political science professor and perennial Green Party candidate with a law degree and [his own newspaper](http://freepress.org/profile/bob-fitrakis). 

I don't know what the answer is to people like him.

<TEXT> Nope. They didn't *steal* it, they just did what ProPublica hopes other news orgs will do, which is reprint their work (by prearrangement). 

I just have a fixation about this because PP is the result of the abandonment of investigative journalism teams at major newspapers in favor of outsourcing to free-standing groups dependent on foundations for funding. It's a terrible model, and the transition cost a lot of very good reporters their livelihoods. So I want PP to succeed with its mixed-funding model, and right now it still needs to demonstrate support by showing public support via clickthroughs and shares.

You did more good than harm by posting any version at all of this very important story. I was speaking mostly to other readers, not you, and I thank you for taking this seeming criticism so well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's everywhere on reddit right now. It would take a lot of swatting, even with the best possible answer, to deal with all of it. I suggest ignoring the venues that will always be hostile to Sanders, and focus on dealing with it in general discussion forums.

And, frankly, this WILL make it to the venue that still determines how a lot of people vote: your local daily newspaper. You may not usually read it, but during the next 18 months, it's a must-read and an important place to speak up, through letters to the editor. </TEXT>

I've been in this business along time, and the amount of self-censorship I see today based on what's assumed to be the consensus about what's worth covering is quite alarming. I think it's partially a function of overvaluing what readers want, rather than an editorial vision of what readers need to know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Good Sam" funds -- which are donations from wealthier clients -- are never advertised, and are used at the discretion of  the vet. I've had good luck with just being upfront at the first appointment about the fact that we have almost no money. 

I hope you will be able to get him in sooner than later, because while this could be a big nothing, it could also be an upper respiratory infection. 

Adding, I once found a filthy, scrawny white kitten so close to death that we named him Spike (after Buffy's undead boyfriend). With a little help from an understanding vet, we saved his tiny life -- and he's now a big, robust 9 year old! So please come back and show us photos of your kitten once he's feeling all better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All true. Every defendant has the right to the assumption of innocence, and to a vigorous defense at trial. But usually this level of comment from defense counsel is saved for the trial, rather than trying the case in the press by blaming the victim.

This particular lawyer, whose bread and butter is DUI cases, has a long-standing obsession with the way consent is defined. Is it ideological? Is it a career move? I don't know, but I do think this interview is over the top.

<TEXT> In 1985, the strike by meatpackers at Hormel's Austin MN plant, represented by United Food And Commercial Workers Local P-9, was the cause celebre of the labor-oriented left in the US, gaining wide support nationally from everyone to the left of Ronald Reagan. Only a handful of trade unionists and labor activists disagreed with the strategy of the local, which pitted it against the national union as well as the bosses. P-9 supporters were outraged by the criticism, which history has vindicated. The dispute has long-lasting implications for all labor organizing, and deserves the closer look it did not get at the time.

The linked piece was written while the strike was ongoing, but it remains the most complete explanation of the issues. It's a very long read, but the key graf is this one:

The outcome of the struggle between industrial unionism
and enterprise unionism will determine the nature of the labor movement in decades to come. Concessions can be won back in later bargaining, as many unions have shown. But a fundamental shift to enterprise unionism will destroy whatever class consciousness still exists in the labor movement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Did it occur to you that a lot of those people have the same sort of analysis of all this that I have? Because they do. 

I suspect that I have a better handle on who does this work nationwide than you do -- if we're talking about people who primarily build organizations and coalitions rather than people who turn out for demonstrations. In my experience, the latter group have almost no idea who the activists are *in their own cities*, let alone nationally, who have been working on this issue for decades. They often don't even know whether DOJ has had any previous involvement with police departments in their own state -- which is such basic ignorance it blows my mind. 

There are *plenty* of very radical people involved in the national movement for police accountability, but they are not anarchists. They are people who have learned the cost of letting the perfect become the enemy of the good, and they are not about to let that happen again.

DOJ intervention does make a difference. I live in a city that was forced into a settlement, and although there are still problems, policing here is nothing like it was before. It is literally a life and death difference for people here, so hearing you dismiss it as "an attempt to sap the energy of movements with shallow reformism" is incredibly insulting.

I don't think you and I will get any closer to agreement with further arguments here, but please, get to know the people who were on this case before you woke up. It will expand your political horizons and give you lots more leaders to respect.

<TEXT> I have attended co-ed schools, so I do know the difference. I was just lucky enough to attend an all-girls school for the critical years when we were all hormonally deranged and socially insecure. If you had no problems in a mixed school, you're lucky. The  problems girls in co-ed schools have are of the sort that are hardest to see, because they consist of omissions: not being as assertive or competitive as they would if not competing for  approval from potential dates; not forming the same kind of intellectually-based friendships with other girls, etc.

EDIT: Adding, this is not just my opinion. There is plenty of research that has consistently found the same result over many decades: [single-sex school produce girls who are academically better prepared, more science oriented and more likely to continue their education.](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/graduates-of-all-girls-schools-85038)

<TEXT> He loves you! My tiny calico used to bring home multiple snakes every spring, to the point where we had to put a sign on the inside of the front door cautioning everyone to beware of cats bearing snakes: if you didn't check before opening the door, she'd run right past you to deposit her "gift" in the middle of the LR floor. Once I took the same snake away from her multiple times, releasing it back into a ravine nearby, only to have her go find the damn thing and bring it back over and over. 

And the thing is, kitties are so *proud* of the gifts they bring that it's hard to get really mad at them for doing what they're born to do.

<TEXT> Yes:  that's the imgur rip-off of the full story -- this is the original source. I saw that album on imgur, recognized that it *must* have come from some journalistic source, because it was too detailed and professionally shot to be just "some guy on the internet", and so went looking for the original source. As a journalist, I'm allergic to rip-offs that don't credit the journalists who did the work.

<TEXT> I'm sorry for your loss. Baxter looked like a lovely friend.

This is a terrible way to learn it, but perhaps your experience can help others get the lesson that cats *always* freak out during a move, and need to be carefully monitored during the run-up and contained during the move itself. Four of my cats flipped out and fled while I was loading the car for the last bit of a move, and I had to stay behind for three days in an empty house before I was able to round them up. I was lucky that time, but I should have known better because it wasn't the first time I'd lost a cat while moving.

May all of us be extra careful with our fur friends hereafter, and may you be comforted by your memories of handsome Baxter.  </TEXT>

Anybody who does this should remember that events like concerts and festivals usually prohibit commercial use of photos of those events, and there's a whole industry of researchers looking around online for images violating those bans. Plus, the big ones have major police presence (that includes OHP), which could bring unwanted attention to the drone operator.

<DATE> 2015-04-22 20:11:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Columbus residents are fortunate to have curbside recycling -- but how well are we doing it? I thought I was being good by saving even scraps of clean cardboard and paper, washing out food containers before putting them in the bin, etc. But then I saw that a friend is saving every plastic bag (although I don't know where she plans to take it), and now I wonder. Do you 

-- empty and wash jars at the back of the refrigerator with contents that have turned into slimy science experiments?
-- tear apart pizza boxes to save the clean cardboard?  
-- refuse styrofoam takeout containers?  
-- use only cloth kitchen towels, rather than paper?  

Bonus question:
Do you urge your friends and relatives to work harder at recycling?

And of course:
Why or why not? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've worked the polls in Ohio for several years, but Columbus has turned decisively blue, and local Dems are more active by the day. So by waiting too long -- a few hours! -- to respond to the BOE's call for workers, I lost out on getting one of the slots reserved for Dem poll workers.

May other pollworkers here also find themselves facing such an embarrassment of riches! </TEXT>

<TEXT> At 4 AM, driving on Sawmill was dicey at best, with visibility of less than 20 feet. Route 161, with no street lights and few residential or commercial light sources, was frankly terrifying. It looked like east Tennessee out there.

If there's a [dead skunk in the middle of the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu5hzc2Mei4) just west of Linworth, I'm afraid that's my fault. It just came out of nowhere. Take care that no animal, car or pedestrian does that to you this morning! </TEXT>

[Applications are online for performers and workshop presenters](https://www.comfest.com/perform/signup.cgi), so nudge your favorite local band to apply soon. Ideas for workshops are especially timely: send these to lithag(at)aol.com with a subject line "ComFest workshop idea".

Whether your thing is pouring beer, wrangling band equipment, recycling or helping visitors find their way around, be sure to get in your request early to get the shift you want. 

And believe it or not, [the Logo Contest is just two weeks away -- March 5](http://www.comfest.com/logo-contest.php) at the Shelterhouse in Goodale Park. If you have an idea but aren't a great artist, try a collaboration with someone who is.

And as always, the [General Planning Meetings are open to all.](http://www.comfest.com/calendar.php) So if you're interested in building this volunteer-run, [mission-driven](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php) work, c'mon down and introduce yourself!

<DATE> 2014-09-28 21:02:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [FAIRHealth Consumer Cost Lookup](http://fairhealthconsumer.org/index.php) can tell you, based on your zip code and the medical procedure codes, what a medical or dental procedure *should* cost, and how to navigate through the reimbursement process. Here's how this invaluable site came to be:

In 2009, an investigation by then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo uncovered conflicts of interest in one system that health insurers used to calculate reimbursement for patients who received care from providers outside their plans network. As a result of this investigation, FAIR Health -- an independent, not-for-profit corporation -- was created to establish and maintain a new database that could be used to help insurers determine their reimbursement rates for out-of-network charges, and provide patients with a clear, unbiased explanation of the reimbursement process. 

As part of the collective settlement the Attorney Generals office reached with the insurers, FAIR Health received millions of de-identified healthcare claims that many had used to help them determine their rates.  This data continues to be analyzed and processed with the goal of increasing its completeness, accuracy, and neutrality, as it will form the basis of our licensed products. The data is also the basis of educational products and tools for consumers made available on this website. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-09-12 05:29:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> She's old (19, spayed), but has been in good health until this afternoon, when she started peeing pink in the bathtub and I immediately made a vet appt. for tomorrow afternoon. After a couple of hours I got her to eat (heartily, Science a/d that we had on hand) and drink, and she went to sleep for a couple of hours. But since she woke up a two hours ago, all she's done is try to pee, with almost no success. She's walking back and forth to the litter box, then crouching there, shaking her tail. She produced a small amount of clear liquid, then nothing. She's miserable.

Other things that might be at work here: she's had an impacted anal sac (6 mos. ago) and does suffer intermittent constipation; the vet says she has small kidneys but hasn't done tests to find out why.

Is this situation dangerous? Is there anything I can do before morning to make her more comfortable?

Thanks in advance for any help of any kind.
