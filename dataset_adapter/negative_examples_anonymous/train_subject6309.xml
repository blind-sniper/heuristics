<TEXT> Hey fellow teachers, In August I will be teaching at a new school(7-12). The current Language Arts teacher is very, very into ECAR(every child a reader) and ECAW(every child a writer). I have done a little research into this program, and it seems to be geared towards elementary age kids, not middle school(what I teach). I am very hesitant to adopt this new teaching program. Any thoughts out there? Are there benefits? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would obviously talk to your administration and if they do nothing, then I would get the union involved.

By the way, a degree in education means that you have training for students in special education. If you don't want kids with special needs in your class I would look for another job, maybe at a charter or private school. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I leave my current teaching position?? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-08 04:48:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, long story short...I am a teacher in a low-income/high teacher turnaround district. This past year I have had some unbelievably horrible encounters with my principal and administration(to the point where I have actually reported to HR). After all of this, I am obviously keeping my eyes open for new teaching jobs, but I have some preoccupations about going to a different school because I truly love my kids and I adore the members on my team. I was hoping all of you could give me some advice?

1. Are all principals bullies? 
2. Do all principals/administrators they use their power to intimidate? 
3. Do all principals compare veteran teachers to newer teachers? 
4. What happens at your school when there is a huge behavior/safety concern ? (For example: a student throws a heavy backpack at another student's head)
5. How does your administrator discuss concerns?(i.e. email? text? face-to-face? hallway?classroom?)

**Thank you all for your help!!**

I need some reassurance that there are good principals out there! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most states require you to take a teacher certification exam like the praxis and they typically require you to complete a student teaching semester/s. 

Just curious, why do you want to become a teacher? (The degree that you have is not as important as your passion for teaching and your passion for your students)

If you haven't taken any education classes I would recommend doing some reading on teaching, observe some classrooms, talk to an expert teacher etc. Make sure that you want to be a teacher of students first and a teacher of your content second. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take care of yourself!!! 
Take breaks, spend time with friends and family.

It is definitely important to work hard and learn a lot in your student teaching;however, it is important that you are sane enough to take in that new wisdom! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a kiddo that sounds just like this kid ,Cameron. I agree with what everyone has said about positive reinforcement, but all of that can take time.

I would suggest a simple change. Do not ask, tell. 
For example, rather than saying " I'd like you to stop talking", say "Cameron, stop talking" or you could put a more positive spin on it and say "Cameron, this is important. You'll want to hear this."

Also, try to have as many of these conversations in private, unless he is shouting out during your instruction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over plan, over plan, over plan!

Make sure that you are rather firm on your classroom procedures and expectations from day 1. Once you have a relationship with your kids, you can ease up on management.

Depending on your grade level, make sure that the first week (unless high school) is really just get to know you activities, team building things, expectations, etc.

Take a deep breath!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in a very similar population, about 90% hispanic with high levels of LEP and NEP students.(This will be my second year) 
I absolutely agree with brettbaileysingshigh(below)!

I would also say to be a hard ass from the get go. Last year, my first year, I wanted my kids to know that I cared and that turned into me being a target for being walked on. Be firm on your rules and expectations! 

Also, make a friend in a veteran teacher! They will know your kids and what works and what doesn't work.

Most importantly, BE YOURSELF!! Kids no when you are being fake in behaviors, rules, etc. Show them how much you care with firm expectations and love! </TEXT>
