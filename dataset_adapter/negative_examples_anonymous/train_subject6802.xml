<TEXT> I was 13, and got a growth spurt which suddenly made me 5'8. Then we went on holiday in Rome and i wore all the same clothes i'd always worn, since i'd only gained height. A specific pair of white shorts- then hotpants got me so many whistles i didn't wear them for the rest of the trip. Hell, I was still reading lemony snicket back then! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, you should definitely complain because that's a disgusting way to treat a person. Being completely honest, probably nothing will happen. I think you should complain for your own peace of mind and in the hopes it ends up in some sort of record. If you can give enough detail, maybe the asshole in question will get a slap on the wrist. I'm sure you're not the only person that ran away from a controller. The stib controllers are there to check your ticket, not critique your life. </TEXT>

-I'd say most people on here are from Flanders

- I think you could be right about that. I think Walloons tend to be more into French culture, they have a bigger market that Dutch speaking areas so we have to turn to English media

- I have honestly no idea! 

- I'd say it goes for the whole country. We tend to see ourselves as two different people but when someone from the outside turns on us, suddenly we're all Belgians. 

- Being totally honest, yes. I personally think it's not done to eat with only your fork if you have company and I think a lot of people will agree.

- I agree with all of those, but I always like giving tourists Duvel for the hell of it. They think it's like lager while it's twice as strong at least! </TEXT>

There was also a portuguese man was found in yet another dock. I believe a couple of months ago they found another body that they couldn't identify.

<TEXT> 1. typical fashion for girls: in student environments i'd say you can wear whatever you want. In my classes (language and lit student) you get goths, preppy, hipsters,... Law students tend to dress more conservative.
2. regular groceries: not sure what you mean by this, but i'd say you can never go wrong with lots of fruit and veg. I feel like those are cheaper than in the US. I'm always stocked on yogurt and cheese as well. Supermarket bread is usually no good so i'd recommend going to a bakery for that.
3. Learning dutch: don't be embarrassed, we all have shitty dialects anyways!
4. blend in: don't! I'm sure people will be interested in where you come from. Belgium is quite boring so we're always happy to hear some stories from the outside world :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 9 years old we had mardi gras (?) at school and me and my best friends dressed up as witches. Our teacher(who i LOVED) was going to take a picture of us together, but before doing so she pushed me out of the group and literally said 'not you'. Apparently she didn't recognize my disguise as a witch... </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad recently became a vegetarian again after 10 years of eating meat. This is all very well and I support him, but the man can't cook a meal to save his life. I go to uni full time and take on the cooking at home - prefer to make everything from scratch. 

My dad being a vegetarian adds 15-20 minutes of cooking every day. I try to make vegetarian dishes we all enjoy as much as possible, but my sister, mother and I do enjoy our meat. Meat and three veg for my dad often comes down to a fried egg and three veg. 

He won't eat tofu, seitan or quorn and I'm honestly getting a little desperate here! Any tips are welcome :-) </TEXT>
