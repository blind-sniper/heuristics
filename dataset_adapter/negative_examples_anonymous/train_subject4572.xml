<TEXT> I was 12, and scared like the title suggests. It was 1994, and my father married the love of his life. I was raised Christian and my Father was thrilled to find out that the 2 houses down neighbor woman was his age, single, and christian too. They met at a neighbors house for a neighborhood wine and cheese party (Sounds silly but this is Portland Oregon and this happens...) He dates her for a year or so then they get married, We go to church and everything's great. When they get married they both decide to keep their own houses and split sleep time between the two. Sweet! I think to myself. I had 2 bedrooms and 2 yards to play in, and now a wonderful little sister.

When Linda was here everything was great! We climbed the trees in the backyards, made perfume for her mother out of summer lavender plants, and went to summer camps and all that usual stuff. When she left to go back to her fathers house in Florida after summer ended, things would always turn dark. The light in the house would seem dimmer, sunlight filtration through the windows would be, I don't know, less like light? One particular night I was in "my room" at my step mothers, in the basement also know as the guest room. Do you know what it's like to bite into a real OREO cookie and how familiar and wonderful it tastes? Then eat a Safeway (West coast food store chain) knock off OREO and you can absolutely tell something is different? That is particularly what this night felt like. I was a fan of Archie comics, I was allowed to read until 10 PM on school nights. I was fully into a new Archie double digest when my flipper clock (Anyone over 30 knows what those are) said 10 PM. 

So being the always eager to please youth that I was, I set my comic down and pulled the string on my lamp and made the room dark for sleep. As many kids do, I gave myself a few minutes to reflect and think, I could not get in trouble for being alone with my thoughts, That was my time. About a minute into my contemplation's of the day, week, or whatever, I heard wind. Slow at first, then steadily picking up in sound. I could not feel it necessarily but I could hear it. I thought, "Fine!" no big deal. But when the wind noise stopped with a sudden veracity, followed by a brief audible "Hshhhh"  I got a little scared, hell, I was 12.

As all this is sinking in (Remember it's summer time and outside it's like 65.) I could visibly see my breath, Puff, puff, puff... I reached my  hand into the complete darkness. A blueish white glow surrounded my splayed fingers and The temperature I felt was cooler than a freezer, the light seemed to be flowing around my fingers like petting a passing furry animal, then it was like there was a vacuum that seemed to pull the anomaly into the abyss directly away from my outstretched hand. Wide eyed and scared, I managed to pull the cord on my night light, scared as to what I might see, I still managed to. The lights came on, and the room looked normal. the temperature slowly over the course of a few minutes returned to normal. 

I told nothing of my experience to anyone for a year or so. In 8th grade when I was 13, we were assigned to write a scary story for Halloween. I figured it had been long enough and I was not so frightened by the experience I would write about it. My teacher was really impressed with the imagery I used with words in the story, she read it to the whole class. Everyone told me it was a really good story. I had one friend I trusted. I told him it was true and he looked at me sideways and laughed and said " Sure Mike!" Later I come to find out my stepmother, after the divorce from my very Christian father, was a Luciferian. A tie maybe? I don't know. It is the most real supernatural experience I have personally ever had.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have never been hacked, 64 key encryption on my Bitcoin core PC wallet. I have mined on the same PC as my wallet... since 2011. Max coin has been 22 BTC. Why is it that people have been hacked? I have a pc that is only online when I do my transactions that hold my coins. Mining for me now and for the last year is unprofitable. Am I wrong in suggesting that you purchase coins on one.. Boot "ye old PC" and transfer real quick, wait for confirmation and then shut down "ye old PC"? Its worked for me maybe you have an old laptop and only use it for BTC stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I brew often(30 or so gallons last year), My highest yield was 10% ABV. A delicious Rye IPA. From what I understand more sugar more potential alcohol. [This guy](http://byo.com/boiling/item/51-21-alcohol-all-grain-beer) has a 21.4 ABV by his readings and he uses some pretty wonky methods I am not familiar with (I am not an aficionado) But it seems he pumps o2 into the fermentor with a welding tank... This is neat to me. I might have to try a super ABV beer for fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Story time: 
I was a big kid, and now an adult who is smaller, 6'3" 250 range. Big but not a fat ass. Its hard to find friends when you are different "Yuk Yuk Yuk, what are you talking about mate, all Americans are fat! Hahahahahaha", ok are we done?. Anyway I was the nice kid, gentle giant, would help anyone anytime. That's how I was accepted and loved and enjoyed every minute of it with enthusiasm. There was a fella, several but this story is about just one.... Because I annihilated him.... Back to my story, he was about 5' 2" and was semi popular. He would poke and prod at me with chummy vigor. I was the first to make a joke about myself (Fat guy defense) but one day he went a little far. We were in shop class, automotive to be specific, and he decided, while the teacher was downstairs answering a phone call, it was his time to assert dominance over me by belittling me in front of my 20 some odd classmates. He told me to shut up and smacked the back of my head... TRIGGER for me. So I turned around and punched him in the side of the face with not 1 iota of hesitation. Mind you I'm mild mannered. The class had an audible "Gasp!" He looks at me with a look of dumbfound confusion. He decides to go forward so to not loose face, mind you I have over a foot on this guy and 100 lbs. He charges me and punches me in my stomach, (It would be more epic if I laughed) but I did not. I grabbed him around the neck and gave him 9-10 solid punches to the spine. Then I picked him up like the dude in the gif and threw him into an area of empty desks. The desk's went scattering and he was on the floor, he gets up and he was shaking like a leaf, stumbles toward me takes another week swing at me and I grab his hand and say "STOP! If you keep going I am going to kill you.... I don't want to hurt you anymore but I will if you don't go sit the fuck down!". He looks at me walks and picks up a desk and sets it upright and sits down. 10 seconds later the teacher walks in and says "What the hell did I miss?" No-one says anything. He looks at my foe and he is visibly shaking like a chihuahua and asks "Are you okay?" School fight rules in the 90's is you don't tattle, and says "yeah, im fine." Dude didn't talk or fuck with me for the rest of high school. Just to let you younger guys know, just because a guy is big and nice, He is like everyone else and has his limits. Don't Fuck with someone just because you think you can up your reputation, because most of the time, they will surprise you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heres a few tricks I used. Keep a scale in the kitchen. Weigh yourself often. Again it's all mental. Constantly ask yourself why you're depressed, ultimately it comes down to your weight and how you feel physically. To be completely honest it will be one of the hardest things you'll ever do but believe me when I say it's worth it. One sure fire way I use when I am gaining a few lbs is to go Paleo. it's not a diet really because you can eat and eat often if you want. Meats, vegies, fruit and certain oils. It takes a bit for your body to adjust to eating healthy but after a week or two its not even a big deal. Last I did it for 2 months and dropped 20 lbs in about a month 260-240. One thing NEVER do is starve yourself, I tried this and ended up in the hospital for 3 days early on in high school with Gallbladder stones, The doc told me a dramatic drop in weight was to blame. The more often you eat and smaller portions will up your metabolism a whole bunch, I can attest to that. You burn calories as you digest, quite a few too, and if you are constantly digesting you are constantly burning calories. Look into the paleo thing, I liked it because I could eat 2 porkchops for dinner if I wanted and not feel guilty, just no bbq sauce but you can grill pineapple and put some sesame oil on it and it's wonderfull. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Roughly 375 lbs huh. I weighed exactly that senior year in high-school at 6'3". Got all the way down to 225 then leveled off in the mid 250 range since. You can do it. You will feel amazing. It's hard work.... Really hard. What I did was convince myself food was my enemy (Really it was) and I would only eat enough to keep going. 100 lbs in a year and a girlfriend. Being healthy opens doors my friend, you just have to figure out how to use your key. </TEXT>

If you drop the apple out of reach of the fat lady another yet mysterious appendage (A fish netted leg) comes from the other side to kick the apple closer to the fat lady so she can reach it, get her fill, and get stabbed yet once again so she can eat more apples. there is creepy violin music with a little piano playing in the background, real scratchy like, And the artistry is that of a French coffee house drawing. </TEXT>

I have a friend with a Sasquatch story from when he was like 13 (Were in our 30's now) that he doesn't tell a lot of people for the above reason. But when he tells it you can see in his eyes and paled face that he is not joking. I believe there's some weird stuff out there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those tubs are used for delivery only, the dry Ice we pack them in only keeps the food to standard temp for like maybe a day, 2 at most if it's winter. But 95% of our frozen food orders are just your standard pallet of frozen food stacked 65 cubes per pallet, then the store puts them in their freezer. We use the Chests and tubs only when the trailer delivering the product's route has a store on they way to their end route. Many factors for using chests and tubs. We try not to use them so much. For routing profitably they are essential. But no, our largest customer is Cash Carry and they never get tubs, they order so much it's profitable to give them the frozen section of the refrigerated trailer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in a Frozen food distribution warehouse, I have seen this before. What happens is the store leaves/forgets the product in an insulated [chest or tub](http://www.bonarplastics.com/Portals/0/Templates/images/PB30.jpg) and it sits in their storage with the pallets and what not for a week or more and the dry ice gets used up so it thaws. When the distributor comes to reclaim the chest or tub they throw it back on the refrigerated trailer and it refreezes. The frozen food warehouse employee assumes it's a return (Because its frozen still) and puts it back into the big freezer and then unfortunately it gets sent out to some sad unsuspecting store assuming the product is fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has anyone else gone through this experience? You're at a 7-11 or Plaid Pantry, the line is like 2 people long, you calmly take your place at the end (Curving because the aisles interfere) and someone walks to the other side of the curve and stands there with their delicious treats. For me it's 3 minutes of "Am I going to have to make an awkward situation by saying something?" And then their is the Dick fuck Busy business guy who grabs a paper and walks to the front of the line and throws the money down and raises the paper, shakes it and says keep the penny and walks out while you do the normal person thing and wait your turn. Or how about the fat disability lady who spends 12 minutes buying lottery tickets while 12 people wait behind her blobenly welfare recipient ass, she has nowhere to be, WE ALL DO! That's worse than cutting as far as I am concerned, Plus it's 8:30 and I have to be to work! Who buys lottery tickets at 8:30 in the morning!!! But yeah I hate cutters. </TEXT>

And yes I told her she is not allowed to drive them anymore for my own reasons mainly and insurance reasons. And you're correct "petite and pretty" has nothing to do with it. The reason I said "petite and pretty" was to give my pissed off brain something good to picture instead of anger towards her. It was an accident but one that kills me a little inside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure the old cases took AT style motherboards. The new standard is ATX so that case is no good. And the power supply was probably like a 230 watt, not to mention Windows 7 takes 35 gigs (For 64 bit) 7.5g is too small, That old AGP card couldn't even run angry birds. Try finding games and software to install on "CD rom". So, New case, new mother board, new hard drive, new DVD rom drive, new graphics card, new power supply, Oh and ram, lets not forget that= New PC. Your old CRT monitor should still work. If Emachines honored all that for 99$, They most certainly would Rock! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can verify this. I work in a freezer, temps are between -10 and -25 degrees Fahrenheit. Years back when my hands would get unbearably cold I would rush to the bathroom and run them under hot water, then a few minutes later they would be in throbbing pain. I was told to not do that because it causes nerve damage over time. Cold slowly to warm is what to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I often have dreams in which I cannot tell whether they happened or were dreamed. Usually these dreams were preceded by a night of drinking, albeit sometimes not much drinking, but drinking none the less. If not maybe ask a doctor, or perhaps before you go to sleep write in a journal of your day and person to person encounters. Then keep a separate journal for when you wake up to report your Dreams/false memories and compare the two. Good luck, I hope it's nothing serious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I worked at Safeway 15 years ago or so, we would have employee parties and there would be way to much food, I'm talking in excess of 5 time to much. Instead of sending leftovers home with employees, or better yet, donating to a local charities. They had us (Courtesy clerks) throw all the food into the trash compactor. I asked my GM why they didn't donate the food or send it home with the employees and he said "If we send it home with you guys that's stealing, If we donate it we make less than writing it off as a loss." Fucked up as far as I am concerned. There's homeless people rite outside of where I worked.... GIVE IT TO THEM DOUCHES! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am 31, our first isp was Prodigy. We had a 14.4 external dial up modem on our 64 mb hd, IBM 386 . When we first logged on I noticed there was a game button on the sweet 16 bit windows 3.1, 12" brilliant 32 color display CRT monitor. Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, the rest is history. Thanks for the memory... Prodigy, I'm getting all nostalgic. But I agree, Bitcoin is here to stay because it is the next big thing. Happy mining. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I myself was introduced by a friend very early on about Bitcoin, back when you could mine one BTC in a pool every 2-4 days, unfortunately for me I stopped at 9.35 BTC about 2 years ago. I have updated my wallet and am now worth 437 US dollars :) I will sit on them for some time and watch my 12 dollars spent in electricity grow. </TEXT>
