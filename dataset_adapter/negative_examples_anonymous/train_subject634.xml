<TEXT> For me the movie I love but everyone else hates is Spiderman 3. Yes, it has its faults, but I still thought it was a decent entry to the Tobey trilogy. I just think everyone had really high expectations for this one after the masterpiece that was the 2nd.

The movie I can't stand but everyone seems to love is Django Unchained. I thought at this point in time and through all his previous films over the years, the good ol' Tarantino formula and style began to wore out on me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Daigo didn't even played badly. Ai Ai Juri play was beyond insane and thoroughly outplayed him. So happy he won and made top 8 at EVO. I hope to see him appear future tournaments to come. 

The saddening thing was Daigo even admitted before Evo he was scared of him because of Ultra 1 so he should've used another character. Again Daigo's biggest weakness of his pride when it comes to counter-picking is shown here. I hope him watching Top 8 EVO makes him realise this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pros for Evo:

- Most prestigious tournament due to its long-standing history
- Insane competition. Have to battle out between 2000+ players
- Biggest fighting game tournament in terms of media, attention from FGC and mainstream public and amount of foreign players entering it
- Biggest points allocated as a premiere event
- Good prize pool


Pros for Capcom Cup:

- Insane competition. Have to battle out between the top 32 players of the entire year.
- Dat 120K and biggest ever prize pool.
- Points wise and organisation-wise from CPT, this is the most important event because every tournament leads to THIS.

What do you think?

2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Wakou): Daigo 2-0

2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Akihabara): Daigo 2-0

2014 Topanga A League 4th - 1st Stage Online: Momochi 3-0

2014 Topanga A League 4th - 3rd Stage Offline: Daigo 8-6

2015 SXSW Invitational: Momochi 2-0

2015 Topanga World League 2: Momochi 5-1

2015 Stunfest: Momochi 3-2, Daigo 3-1, 3-1


Overall: 21-21

<TEXT> The average player from Japan is better than the average player from US. I'm tired of seeing no-name matches on stream while all the higher-profiled players getting blown up off-stream. This is purely from a spectator mindset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Filipinoman's C14 pool is no joke either. His 3rd potential opponent is a a very strong Japanese cody player, Sidou13.

This potential match should also be streamed.

Daigo's pool looks simple and seems to have mostly unknowns. But you are dead wrong. He has some pretty strong possible Japanese players to contend with:

- baby nine (#8 BP ranked Guile in Japanese Arcades)
- Aiai ( (#4 BP ranked Juri in Japanese Arcades)

These matches should also be streamed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seth Killian's commentary can be very condescending and smug sometimes. Also dickrides Daigo too much when he's playing (see Evo 2013 Top 8). However, his style is very interesting to hear compared to other commentators since rather than focusing by what's happening in the match, he focuses on the mindset and mentality of players as a whole and on the fly. You can thank his doctorate in philosophy for all of these insights. 

Zhi is an enigma. When he's under restraint in a professional environment, he is actually the best commentator when it comes to play-by-play. But 90% of the time, he's on the extreme spectrum of "colour" commentary. He's like a hit-and-miss vesion of Aris when it comes to the anime references/memes/jokes. He's halfway between good and high tier a.k.a his own tier. This is because he has the advantage of knowing the Asia FGC scene better than the US commentators as well as capable of speaking it.

Mike Ross is terrible end of story. But I guess that's his style in terms of being a "hype" man in a WWE way. Both Ultra David and James Chen admit that when they are paired up with him, they sometimes accidentally say stupid shit. That says it all. 

Combofiend isn't much better but since he works for Capcom, his play-by-play is slightly better and seems articulate on the mic.

The most frustrating thing about James Chen is that he's the perfect template of what a commentator should do, but I feel like his work on it has barely improved throughout all these years of experience. He should already realise by now on the faults he has when commentating such as getting stuff wrong within the match, being mis-informed on other stuff relating to players and such. Otherwise, when he's paired with Ultra David, most of the time he is very good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tokido is a solid pick. I don't why people only praise for his technical side (vortex and set-plays). His ground game since Ultra has levelled up a ton and it's a testament to his skill as a player that he had to reinvent himself in the way he plays Akuma to succeed in this iteration. 

I doubt EX Pugera will do as well as he did last year (9th place). Ibuki might seem top 5 on paper, but in tournaments, his character gets exposed by her bad matchups a little too much.

RB is an inspiring choice. Hope you're right!

Momochi is a straightforward pick. No complaints

Dieminion is also another good pick since he has a decent track record against the asian killers. Although I vouch Nuckle Du to do better since he has the edge of having multiple characters up in his sleeve.

I can't comment on valmaster since I don't know him very much. I do know he's probably the best chun in the world; on par with Vivi if not better.

Fuudo to me has stagnated. At this point, his character feels too linear and already figured out to really make a dent in the tourney. He will remain a solid, workhorse at the Top 16 spot.

No complaints about Xian as well although his myriad amount of pocket characters will serve him well in pools and semis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ryan Hart uses Ryu, Yun, Decapre, Abel. What do u expect? He's given up being a Sagat specialist. 

He's no Bonchan. He's not even on Gachikun and Santarou Man level in terms of Sagat play.

He's probably on par with Sanford Kelly though. hehehe.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> He is a very underrated player (along with Gackt) since he doesn't enter tournaments that much. He's still probably the best Sakura player for the last 3 years. Only other people that come close are Uryo (when he still mained her as a specialist) and Juso.

<TEXT> Eita has better reactions and better anti-airs than Tokido. He is also better at the akuma mirror when these two play.

But, yes he does play very "freestyle" like. He still plays very technical (vortex heavy) like Tokido and -6 (he now plays Poison) though.  </TEXT>
