<TEXT> I've been on the sea my entire life you see. But worry not,the story of mine starts with no thunderstorms and ten foot waves splashing the deck of my fathers old catamaran. In fact, we made it through one of those last night just fine! Sure, there were moments when i thought the wind will send me flying over the borders and into a salty death, hell I even almost got my head knocked straight of by a rampaging crate that had gotten loose, only to be saved in the nick of time by my reflexes. My ass I'm too old to be on the ship, bet that must have showed them I can still walk that hard walk and talk that smooth talk, but sure they've been awfully quiet all day today, even going as far as complaining about it being cols every time I strolled around. But enough about that, what's been in the past should be left there, even if it was yesterday.


We got off on a tiny Italian harbor, looking just like the one I grew up in. Well I'll be damned, I said as soon as i got off, those church bells look just like the ones we used to throw rocks at to hear them ring, old Augustino and I! Been a long time since I saw him too, something along the lines of cancer or other bullshit they tell you these days when you go to the doc. None of the boys seemed to care for either what I was rambling about nor all the Innkeepers coming to see how our trip had gone, they just pushed through,shoulders wide and still soaken sailor hats in their hands.


I felt not the rush they did. I was just fine with walking around and taking a look at the masses that had gathered around our ship, as if something on it was different than all the rest that docked here every other day. Why on earth do you people take such a liking in the old lady,sure,she aint no pretty gal, but she knows how to keep her head high in a storm!



All these years and you still havent learned when to shut up?


I turned around towards the ship just in time to see two familiar faces, Augustino and Francesco, both my childhood friends.Sheesh, time sure didnt take a toll on either on them, they both looked as young as I remember them, even Francesko who I heard from some fellow sailors was battling some disease he caught going naughty in places he shouldn't have. Must have also kicked the shit out of it while at that, or at least proved those labcoats were just bullshitting again, judging by his looks.


The fuck are you two doing here?Is this some kind of a reunion I came late to?



Well you certainly are the last one to come Vinnie, but fuck it, you sure did choose a more fun way to go than either of have! Augostino said that through a grin that almost made him choke on his own words.


What do y-


As I have said that, a coffin was dropped from the Ship in front of me, making me realize my reflexes are nowhere near what they used to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Story time:


During a party at a friends place,one of the friends got really,really drunk.Like he didn't know where the hell he was most of the time.At one point,i see him wondering outside and tell him lets go inside and have you sit down.

But I have to find my brother!

At this point his brother was standing next to him and looking at me trying to figure out what was going on.So I tell him:


Your brother's right here,lets go inside,he'll go there with us.

Instead of responding to that,he gives me a long stare and gives me a slap across my face.Now if he wasn't a good friend of mine and half my size,this would have ended a lot different.So i pick him up,take him inside and lay him on the couch and tell him to stay there while i go get something for him so he sobers up.


Now,as I'm walking my female best friend walks up to me and asks me why i look angry.To which i respond by explaining what happened.Now the funny part.


She starts screaming at me.Direct quotes:


You cant be fucking angry at someone thats drunk!


But im not angry at him!


Yes you fucking are i see it in your eyes!


Im slowly starting to get confused here,as I would never hurt the guy even when he was sober.
Dude Im just going to go get him something to sober up


No!Youre staying right here because you will hurt him if you go there!

At this point people are gathering around and laughing due to her screaming at me and me looking confused as fuck.Later on,instead of apologizing the only thing she said was We both made mistakes then.

Thats pretty much what caused me to stop hanging out with her for some time,but alas shes still the best friend i ever had. </TEXT>

Anyway,i want you hear what you guys think!

<TEXT> The server kick?Well if i remember well in that time it would take you a lot to get a hat.I remember that getting 1 drop per 50 hours was fantastic,because that was all the way before they updated the drop system...Well anyway,the kick was just a running joke we had on the servers,even if there were no admins around the guy that got the hat would just leave and come back,hell i even remember when my friend got a Camera Beard(mind you they were awesome back then),left the server,came back only to have another Camera Beard drop for him.The funny part was that one of the head admins was hoping to get that item for awhile,and with no trading implemented then all we could do is laugh at his fortune </TEXT>

<TEXT> You guys should try out Lost Planet 2...even though the game received a negative response from the ign/gamespot,two of my friends and I found the campaign quite entertaining.Aspecially if you enjoy Big Boss Battles.

As for it having to be free,well I'd have to say you could always try Spiral Knights...that's the only free coop game that is right now on my mind

Edit: Just remembered,if you don't mind downloading it,you can get Marvels Ultimate Alliance.Now that game is something fun to play,and I'd say its  maybe 3-4 years old </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh well,I honestly tried writting you a haiku.But unfortunately my non traditional(5-7-5)haikus were spat on from the side of Private.
So i will call this a-short-not-a-haiku-poem-that-rhymes

Fine Says He.
Then spits on poetry of me,
The Private he be.

Good enough? </TEXT>
