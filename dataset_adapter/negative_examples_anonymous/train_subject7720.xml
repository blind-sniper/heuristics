<TEXT> i would disagree, wizards already puts out the basis for magic the gathering as an animated property with its set trailers,  animated does not necessarily mean for children,  look how clone wars is done or avatar,  you can have serious themes like war and politics with humor and it still be an amazing show.  that being said magic's already expansive cast of characters would be amazing on screen, plus planeswalker action figures </TEXT>
