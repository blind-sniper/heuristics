<TITLE> If the Academy Awards were ever going to decide to acknowledge stunt performers/choreographers, I feel like this tear would be the perfect year. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've always thought that stunt performers and choreographers deserved to be recognized at the Academy Awards. I know a lot of people might look down on action movies, but I don't see how this category would be any less deserving than any special effects or other technical categories.

This year we've had Avengers, Fast and Furious and Mad Max, and we've still got Star Wars, Mission Impossible and Spectre to come. 

Obviously this year has been a hell of a year for stunt performers and choreographers, and would be the perfect year to finally show some respect towards people who literally risk their lives for entertainment.

Edit: This YEAR not tear. Dammit. </TEXT>

Also, was it ever confirmed that there was more than Afghanistan and Africa as locations in the game? A lot of people have been saying there's a third, and I was hoping for a snowy forest/tundra environment, but the release is very close and it doesn't seem like anything official has said there's any more than 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it was fine. Some great destruction porn scenes, great CGI and San Francisco and LA get nicely decimated over and over again. Not as crazy stupid and cartoonishly over the top and insanely massive as 2012, which could either be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for. The Rock has some emotional serious moments, there's also some terribly cheesy moments. Not the best disaster porn movie ever but probably better than most maybe, I never thought it dragged or got boring. Pretty much no better or worse than I'd expected from the trailer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In some of the early videos, it looked like there were dev options for "easy" Fatalities or even maybe turning off Brutality requirements. Are these options in the same for single play or local multiplayer? I'll probably play a lot of this game with friends, and they don't really know how to play these types of games, so I thought it'd be cool if there was an easy mode so we could just hang out and have a laugh and see all the violent stuff.

Transformers is obnoxious annoying characters and offensively terrible cringey comedy along with exhausting shaky cam incomprehensible loud dull cgi action scenes. Transformers movies are self serious boring 3 hour long messes.

I'm all for opening up a dialogue and talking about certain topics and I'm certainly not trying to be biased towards one point of view over another, but stuff like this is just annoying and embarrassing and pointless.

<TEXT> Recharging health? Great. Sutherland instead of Hayter? Perfectly fine with me. Open world instead of linear levels? Awesome.

However, not having access to the awesome Codec at any time and being able to call who ever you want whenever you want is a real bummer for me. That was honestly one of the coolest and most unique and impressive things about the older games. All that detail and crazy back story and funny secret dialogue being put in to boring cassette tapes is a real step backward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't remember exactly what morning talk shows he was on, but I've seen at least 2 interviews where he talks about how difficult it was for him to film scenes without Paul and pretend he was still there and how he basically couldn't stop crying the whole time. He said it was the most difficult time he has ever been through. He didn't say anything overly negative, probably because he was still selling the film, but it was clear he really didn't enjoy pretending his friend was in scenes with him. 

Maybe in a year or so everyone will be feeling better and want to make a new film, but it seemed pretty obvious that everyone was having a rough time continuing the film without Paul. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to the behind the scenes videos and pictures that were leaked/released, Paul was on the set for most of the bus stunt and cars jumping out of the planes. There's behind the scenes clips of him doing the bus jumps stunt and shots of them filming the cars falling from the plan in front of a giant green screen. Also that scene at 1:33 was in the first trailer.

However, Jordana Brewster had yet to have her first day of filming before he died, so any scenes he shares with her (like the house exploding at the start) would be faked.

I believe they said they had reshot the film so that Paul Walker's character would retire to be with his wife and child, leaving the rest of the crew open to more adventures if they felt the need to make more. I know the plan was initially to make at least another 2 films after this. But who knows what they're going to do now. Vin Diesel seemed to really struggle working on the film without Paul. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I really wish passengers in vehicles could use 2 handed weapons </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-04 07:56:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Obviously anyone driving a vehicle can't use two handed weapons, but it really bothers me that passengers can't.

Often during a job or a mission my friends and I will be in the same car, and if we get chased by cops or Merryweather or anyone with a helicopter or heavy vehicles, it seems really silly that the passengers just have to sit there and use SMGs or pistols. This seems especially silly in boats because there shouldn't be any reason why passengers can't use every weapon there.

Throwing grenades or sticky bombs out the window as a passenger is pretty helpful sometimes, but I don't see why the passengers can't lean out the window and use a normal gun.

Maybe there could be a button that has your character lean all the way out the window, which would make you way more vulnerable and a much easier target, but you'd be able to use machine guns and launchers.

Just a little thing that would improve online a lot for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously we've seen there's a few more cars and masks and whatnot, but I really hope the Heist update comes with a whole tonne of new clothes and tattoos and properties and new fun stuff.

I've only just hit level 90, I don't have a crazy amount of money, but I just feel like there's nothing left for me to buy. There's not really any more cars I want or any reason to go buy a new property. I feel like I already have everything I want in the game so I have nothing left to work for.

I'm excited for the heists because my friends and I are kinda bored with the regular jobs and would like to play through all the heists together. But I really hope they add in heaps of new fun things to buy so we have a reason to earn hundreds and thousands of dollars after every heist. Because right now there's not really a whole lot left to unlock and not really anything left to spend my money on. Not anything that's worthwhile that I really want anyway.

EDIT: I wish they added the ability to fast travel between properties, that way I'd have a good reason to buy a second property up in Sandy Shores </TEXT>

But now we're all a high enough level that there's nothing new to unlock, and we all have enough money that there's nothing new to save up for. So I'm eagerly awaiting Heists so we can get excited about playing together again and have some new fun things to do.

<TEXT> Those are more revenge movies than vigilantism. Vigilantism movies tend to be positive towards the violence portrayed by the protagonists, whereas revenge movies tend to be more anti-violence. They are very very similar tropes and there is a lot of overlap

*GOOD* revenge movies tend to show that revenge is ultimately futile. Violence ends in heartbreak and destruction and corruption, the the protagonist is usually worse off in the end. A good revenge movie shows how letting emotions and rage and violence control you is the ultimate evil. Much like the movies you listed.

Bad revenge movies (and most vigilantism movies) are about how cool and fun it is to kill everyone you want and how it solves all your problems and the protagonist wins in the end. Like in Boondock Saints. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would it be possible for someone to 'give' their Online character to someone else? </TITLE>

<TEXT>  Character Transfer
 You will need a Rockstar Games Social Club account linked to the console accounts used when previously playing GTA Online.
 When entering GTA Online, you will be given the option to transfer your previous GTA Online character and progression data. Once you have chosen to transfer your previous character and progression data, the transferable in-game money, RP and Rank of all previous characters will be displayed. These are the characters that will be transferred to the PlayStation4 or Xbox One. Once the transfer has completed, you will be prompted to choose a character and enter GTA Online.
 You will still be able to play your existing characters on PlayStation3 and/or Xbox 360, however any progress made with versions of the characters on those systems after a transfer will remain on those systems only. Any existing PlayStation4 or Xbox One GTA Online character and progression data will be replaced by the previous character and progression data during the transfer, except for any existing in-game money, which will be combined with your transferred balance.
 All earned in-game money will transfer. Purchased in-game money that has not yet been spent will only transfer within a console family (e.g. PlayStation3 to PlayStation4).

So next gen and last gen characters will now be separate across both platforms. So would someone on last gen who does not wish to purchase the new version of the game be able to essentially 'give' a next gen player their GTA Online account? The last gen version will remain, so as long as that person isn't planning on upgrading, they won't lose anything and can keep playing, and then a next gen player would be able to start with a GTA Online character that's already leveled up and wouldn't have to worry about grinding to unlock stuff.

Basically, if a friend A has the game on last gen and doesn't want to buy the new version, and friend B buys the next gen version but doesn't want to have to start from nothing, would friend B be able to use friend A's Rockstar account once to log in and get their character, or is it locked to the Rockstar account you already have </TEXT>

<TEXT> Handling and physics still need some serious tweaking.

The UI is really overbearing and messy

The rubber banding is very frustrating

Too many long loading screens and cutscenes and other screens and pop ups to click through stopping me from getting back into the game. 


I really think this game is super cool and has amazing ideas and has the potential to be an incredibly fun and massive experience. Ivory Tower has certainly worked really hard to make such an ambitious game come together and I so badly want it to work. But I just don't think it's quite there yet.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not trying to be a troll or a hater or anything so sorry if this seems harsh, I'm just a disillusioned Sony/driving game fan.

Servers still aren't working so I can't really comment on the social club aspects, but after playing it all day I'm incredibly disappointed. Firstly, the graphics are amazing, so that's a plus. I also think the driving physics are fine. But it's so depressingly bare bones. And I don't just mean the PS Plus version.

Now, I wasn't expecting a big Forza Horizon style game at all, and I'm certainly not a Forza or Xbox fanboy just trying to bash the game. I knew this was a simple, small game with a clear direction. I was very excited for this game and was really hoping it'd be fun. Unfortunately after about five minutes of playing there's absolutely nothing new or fun to see.

The full game doesn't have a very big or varied car selection at all, no American or Japanese cars of any kind, only three game modes, only one of which is worth playing, no customization, no tuning, no worthwhile options or replayability to be found. You can't even go slightly off the road without a big timer threatening to reset you for some reason, the game slows down your car as a penalty if you so much as slightly cut a corner or hit the AI too many times, and the AI is pretty oblivious and sketchy so this happens a lot. The game just feels so small and restrictive and aggressively mediocre and boring. Just seems like a really basic stripped down simple game with nothing at all going for it aside from having nice visuals and the fact that Forza isn't on Playstation. Plus even the social stuff I don't yet have access to isn't exactly super exciting either.

Obviously going into this game I knew it wasn't going to have tonnes of depth or any customization or anything. I wasn't expecting a massive game and I don't want to put bodykits or anything on my car, but you can't even play around with ABS or traction control or even change the color of the stock car. The game is constantly restricting you and denying you and penalizing you. It's hard to believe a big budget retail game released in 2014, after a year long delay, could be this empty and pointless.

I know there's some updates coming after launch (after a whole goddamn year long delay) but I can't imagine I'd still be playing this game by then.

The game is very very pretty, and I do actually think the driving physics are okay, it could have and should have been good, but it's so incredibly boring and shallow and empty and lifeless. Even if the full version was free I don't know if I'd keep playing it. This game just brings absolutely nothing new or interesting or fun to the table. There are a million driving games on the market already and this game seems like a huge step down compared to pretty much all of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm super excited for this movie but this description sounded really crazy and dumb. 

For a movie about dinosaurs on the loose in modern day, Jurassic Park was all fairly grounded and realistic. The park and the way it operated and the science behind it made it feel real. This just sounds like really over the top crazy fantastical sci fi nonsense that is way too far removed from reality for me to care about. 

Muzzled raptors, kids in gyrospheres in an enclosure with giant theropods, feeding great white sharks to dinosaurs, genetically engineered super-dinosaur monsters. I really hope it doesn't end up being as ridiculous and unbelievable as it sounds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely sounds like raptors attacking a woman on a tennis court. Sounds pretty darn graphic and dark for a Jurassic Park movie. Do we have any idea where this audio is coming from? If it's from a reliable source who was on location then that's interesting, and it's pretty common for sound effects to be played on set for people to react to since they'd be using CGI, but realistically anyone could make these sounds at home pretty easily.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've yet to start the Batman Incorporated storyline, although I have read all of Morrison's work leading up to it. I am planning to purchase the Pre-New 52 Batman Incorporated paperback, and then both Volume 1 and 2 of the New 52 Batman Incorporated. 

I'm kinda confused by the fact that the new 52 paperbacks are titled Volume 1: Demon Star and Volume 2: Gotham's Most Wanted. When I look up the storyline on Wiki it says pre-52 was Volume 1, and New 52 is Volume 2. I just want to make sure I'm buying the right books and reading them in the right order without missing anything or making any redundant purchases. So is pre-52 part 1, and then New 52 is part 2, but then part 2 is split into Volumes 1 and 2?

I'm so confused. Is there a paperback that collected Demon Star and Gotham's Most Wanted into one book?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Hes not like Peter Quill. Theres not much humour, I think hes a little more John Wayne than Marty McFly. Hes deadly serious. There are comedic elements in the film, just not coming from my character."

Huh. I don't think I've ever seen Chris Pratt play a character like that. I obviously wasn't expecting a character as funny and wacky as Andy or Starlord, but I certainly wasn't expecting this. I'm interested to see how this goes.

Theres humour but then, from page 25 on, theres not that much to laugh about.

This is also interesting. I'm no expert, but that seems pretty early for things to go wrong. One of my favorite aspects about Jurassic Park was that we got through almost the entire first half of the movie with *pretty much* no dinosaurs or deaths, and I was really hoping to get a good long exploration of the new park and how it works and functions and people interacting with it and how the dinosaurs exist in the park before everything goes bad.

I really can't wait for a trailer because I still feel like I have no solid idea of what the general tone and direction of this movie will be. I'm excited. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jeez that article took a damn long time to get to the point. Basically it's saying we should stop referring to the alien in the Alien franchise as a Xenomorph, since it isn't the real name of the alien, just a vague term they use to describe a life form they haven't documented yet. Well duh. Xenomorph sticks because it's the only name anyone ever gave it and it's better than the Alien alien.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suck at math, but if you could guess roughly how many hours he spent running, and estimate what his average running speed would be (probably faster than an average man, maybe mid-tier athlete speed) then you could maybe work it out that way.

I haven't seen the movie in ages but didn't he run for pretty much a whole day straight from when he escaped from the city to where his wife was stranded back at their village, give or take a couple hours. 

I don't think there's any way at all to get a real answer but you could get a rough estimation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "It's BONKERS  weird, weird, weird," one person who saw the film told me. "It made me laugh out loud several times, but not in the ways you might expect. The humor is not so much 'Boogie Nights,' as I think a lot of people are expecting. For reals, it tips into, like, Zucker Bros.-level gags and broad humor."

PTA is one of my favorite directors working today, and I'm really looking forward to this film. But I really hope there's a trailer some time soon so I can figure out what the hell this movie is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't played GTA Online at all, I completed GTA 5 on Xbox and was waiting for Online to be working properly before I started playing again but I never did. But I'm still super keen to get GTA 5 when it releases on next gen systems. One of the things I'm really excited about is all the new awesome vehicles and weapons that have been released on GTA Online since launch. 

I was just wondering, will all these new updates be available for use in single player? Do all the new vehicles and weapons currently become available for purchase by Michael/Trevor/Franklin once you've installed the GTA Online updates?

Rockstar had this to say 

"All new content and gameplay created since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including an extensive array of new Jobs, an arsenal of new weapons, scores of new vehicles, new properties and player customizations will also be available for the PlayStation 4 system, Xbox One and PC with much more to come. In addition, the current community of players will have the ability to transfer their Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to their choice of PlayStation 4, Xbox One or PC," 

So if we buy the game on a next gen system of some kind, will all these new things be available for purchase in single player from the start? </TEXT>

I think Joe is just used to saying whatever the hell he wants on his show with no repercussions, since it's a very casual non-formal podcast where anyone can talk about anything they want like friends hanging out.

Dunning on the other hand, is from a podcast where he is claiming to be scientifically accurate and constructive and influencing people's ideas and behaviour.

They're two completely different guys with completely different goals with completely different beliefs about what their responsibilities as a host of a podcast show are, and so their styles just clash horrendously and they can never really find any common ground.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I listened to this podcast when it first came out, and man, I love both these guy's shows, so this was pretty painful to listen to. 

I really hate how Dunning said "you're taking my words too literally" whereas absolutely  every single complaint Dunning had against Joe's podcast was based on taking all his words totally literally and then trying to pick them apart to prove Rogan to be wrong.

Dunning clearly wasn't expecting Rogan to fight back as much as he was, probably because whenever he debunks things on his Skeptoid podcast it's just him by himself talking to no one. But then Rogan also clearly doesn't give a shit about logical fallacies and scientific arguments and cares more about just chatting casually person to person, and the two styles do not mix at all. 

Dunning seemed to just keep trying to pick apart everything and anything he could to try to seem smarter, and Rogan was just so non-specific and all over the place. It made Dunning seem like a total petty douche bag, and made Rogan seem like he doesn't get a lot of points Dunning is making, or doesn't really care to.

I still enjoy both their podcasts, and they both seem like really nice dudes, but this podcast just went on and on and on in increasingly argumentative and petty circles that it was too infuriating to listen to.  </TEXT>

But when it got good, it was an incredible experience. Really well shot, all the bits with Godzilla were great, the first act felt really strong and like it was building to something great.

One of my favourite composers around, everything he does is so fun and lively and interesting and full of energy. The only complaint I ever hear about him is that he's clearly very derivative of John Williams' style, and that's definitely an intentional thing.

<TEXT> TLDR; 9/10

"Few recent films have had as much pre-release hype as Gareth Edwards Godzilla, as legions of devoted fans have hungrily devoured each new detail, tease, and marketing release. So, does it deliver? In a word: Yes.

Legendary Pictures' Godzilla origin story carries the weight of unwieldy expectations, but rather than buckle, it is ultimately a fantastic - though imperfect - example of the genre. Gareth Edwards both depicts what is beloved about this magnificent creature and creates a film that is distinctly its own entity, one that brings Godzilla to gorgeous new life. The Easter Eggs and nods to previous versions and additional suitmation favorites will likely be appreciated by sharp-eyed aficionados. If Edwards installment serves as your introduction to the King of the Monsters, though, theres plenty for you to enjoy as well."

<TEXT> I disagree but it is pretty dang fantastic .

The final fight in a The Raid 2 is incredible. It's so intricately and amazingly well choreographed, and is certainly an unmatched show of skill and technique. But the final fight in the first Raid just felt way more brutal and exciting, all three men were completely destroyed and battling to survive and you could feel the desperation and brutality, coupled with the emotional aspect of Rama trying to save his brother. 
Plus the Assassin wasn't nearly as well built up as an unstoppable killing machine as Mad Dog.

I never once felt that Rama was in any way close to losing the fights in the second movie. And while they were much more varied and better choreographed on a technical skill level, the first film had an insane sense of urgency and brutality and it constantly felt like Rama was only just barely surviving each encounter. Plus The Raid 2 had tonnes of fights that didn't even involve the main characters so the outcome didn't even really matter. 

Fucking amazing film though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jurassic Park movies have always had very very normal every day looking characters. They were always believable and real and were perfect for the 'ordinary person in an extraordinary situation' theme that Spielberg has always been great at.
I mean don't get me wrong, Neill and Goldblum and Dern are all good looking people, but they were realistically good looking, and were just ordinary realistically-aged unexceptional scientists who were out of their element.

This whole cast looks super young and fit and Hollywood-attractive, and people have even been saying Pratt is playing an ex-marine dinosaur wrangler.

Doesn't exactly seem like the same realistic relatable ordinary regular cast of characters we're used to from this franchise.

But hey, I'm sure it's no big deal and I'm still super excited for this movie in a big big way. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got really excited when I saw that Toho was releasing every single Godzilla movie on Blu-ray this year, only to find out that none of them will apparently have English subtitles. 

I've been trying to collect Godzilla DVDs for quite some time now, but it's so hard tracking them all down and figuring out which ones were released in which region. I have a couple that have dubs and subtitles, some with just subtitles, some with both the American and Japanese versions on one disc, and other films I simply can't find on DVD at all. And of course there's a handful of Godzilla movies on Blu-ray already but no where near a full collection.

I was super excited to just get all these new Blu-rays, but without subtitles they're pretty much useless to me, so I just don't know what to do about building the perfect collection.

Any help or advice from any other Godzilla collectors would be greatly appreciated. Anyone know if these new Toho Bluray releases might find themselves getting an international version with subtitles or am I just going to have to be happy with my hodge podge of mismatched Blurays and DVDs forever </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would go for the original 1954 Godzilla, then the 1984 Godzilla, and then maybe Godzilla 2000. 
There are 3 distinct 'eras' of Godzilla, "Showa" starting with the 1954 original, "Hesei" starting with the 1984 Godzilla, and 'Millenium" starting with Godzilla 2000. Each era the timeline is 'rebooted' and starts fresh to be accessible for new viewers.

Godzilla vs Biollante, Godzilla vs Mothra (1992) Giant Monsters All Out Attack (my personal favorite) Tokyo S.O.S, and Godzilla vs Desotroyah are pretty highly regarded and very accessible and would probably be the best to watch before you start really getting deep into the weirdness that is the Godzilla franchise

Obviously this is leaving out a lot of the classics, (like Godzilla vs King Kong, Destroy All Monsters, Smog Monster, etc.) but I think starting on the older campier crazier Showa movies might be kinda jarring to modern viewers unfamiliar with Godzilla since they are pretty weird and cheap and out there, and aren't always easy to watch, and might need to be eased into after some more 'normal' Godzilla films.

You shouldn't really need to worry about any exact order or anything since most of the films are fairly stand alone so you can pretty much jump around as you wish. 

James Rolfe (AVGN) has a fantastic little series that briefly sums up each Godzilla film and explains the different eras and styles [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avc4AS3AvcA list=PLAAD30B9523D89FAA), and I highly reccommend watching this first and then choosing your own order based on what appeals to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, boo I am so jealous. Secondly, some spoiler free questions. 

How was it tonally? Was it as dark and apocalyptic as the trailers or was it a bit more summer blockbuster?

The trailers seem to be showing off a lot of Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe, how was Aaron Taylor Johnson as the lead?

Do we get the atomic breath?

Do we get decent story and character stuff outside of a typical big monster/disaster blockbuster movie?

We've heard a lot about not seeing a whole bunch of Godzilla until the final showdown in San Francisco. Mostly just glimpses and short sequences and a whole lot of build up. Is this accurate? If so, how does the first half handle not having much monster action? 

And most importantly, once we get to the big San Francisco sequence, how long is it and how much action do we get? Do we get some big extended city destruction like a lot of big action films have had recently?

It's so hard to avoid ruining this movie for myself. I'm trying not to read too much or even watch those new clips but the hype is so strong. Only 2 more weeks... </TEXT>

It's stupid and cheesy and can be horribly lame and cringy sometimes, but somehow less offensive than most reality shows around. A lot of the personalities were actually pretty fun to watch. There are always a few narcissistic delusional assholes on shows like this, but despite being quite awkward a lot of the time, some of them really seem like genuinely good people. 

Episodes are way too long and over-dramatized, but I was surprised at how much I got into it. And I usually really hate geexploitation shit like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 605 feet?

The new 2014 Godzilla is the biggest Godzilla has ever been and he's 350 feet. He was originally about 160 feet.

Godzilla certainly is more durable, and his radioactive breath and seemingly supernatural strength and healing abilities make him insanely powerful, but Slattern would still be a pretty worthy opponent for him. Plus we never really get a clear description of what exactly Slattern is capable of.

Due to Godzilla's radioactive breath and his ability to seemingly gain strength and power and heal himself whenever the plot requires, he'd probably be a Cat 6, but Cat 7 seems a little crazy and is downplaying the size of strength of Slattern a considerable amount.

Although it's really hard to put Godzilla and other Kaiju into the Pacific Rim class system because of how much their size and strength and abilities change from movie to movie.

<TEXT> Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies, and when I was a kid I absolutely loved all 3 movies. So I'll try to explain why, to me, the second two don't hold up anymore like the first one does.

Really boring stories, with no sense of wonder and discovery and science and wondering 'could this happen in real life?" Just generic stranded on an island with monsters plotlines. The Lost World has some potentially interesting ideas but didn't go anywhere with them.

Really dull and dreary tone. Jurassic Park was 50% fun and joy and childlike wonder, and then 50% terror and fear and tension. 2 and 3 were just bland, not very engaging, leaving us waiting for something exciting to happen.

Boring characters. Jurassic Park had fun lovable realistic characters, 2 and 3 were filled with pretty generic two dimensional dinosaur-meals. Even Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill didn't seem like they were acting like their characters from the first. Pete Postlethwaite in The Lost World is an exception.

Didn't do anything new or interesting with the dinosaurs. Jurassic Park made the dinosaurs seem real and amazing, like we had never seen before. It was new and exciting and made them feel like real living animals, and brought on all the emotions of wonder and amazement, and then fear, that comes with that. In 2 and 3, sure all our favorites came back, and there were some new ones, but they just felt like monsters.

Frankly 2 and 3 just felt lazy and boring and uninspired. None of the cast or crew seemed very enthusiastic about churning out more cash-in installments. Acting was meh. Direction was meh. Story was meh. No emotions or excitement or fun or discovery or wonder. Just dinosaurs killing generic characters. The Lost World had a potentially interesting premise, and some of the action set pieces were alright, but as a whole it was flat and dull and pointless. And then Jurassic Park 3 felt like a lame cheap sci-fi tv movie.

Jurassic Park made you feel like you were there and captured your imagination. It was a new and exciting experience like never before. 2 and 3 were just excuses to watch more people get eaten by monsters for 90 minutes.

That's just my opinion anyway.

<TEXT> I haven't seen it, but I believe so. 

Dark Knight had the same thing where the 65mm IMAX shots and scenes were a different aspect ratio than the rest of the scenes. Most of the movie was normal widescreen, whereas the action sequences and shots of the city were more 'full screen' or 'square'.

MI4 had IMAX shots as well, but the aspect ratio was made to be the same as the rest of the movie. I guess it depends on whether or not the director wants that fluctuating widescreen effect.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 35mm is the normal film size. 65mm is double size and is not so normal. Gives a much better quality, larger, richer, grander picture. Basically like bigger better resolution on your screen.

Sound of Music, Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, 2001, Samsara and recently The Master were filmed on 65mm. Chris Nolan uses it sometimes for special shots or sequences. It's a pretty big difference if you look at them side by side.

IMAX uses 65mm film as well, but I think you get a larger image due to aspect ratio... Or something... I don't actually know much about IMAX at all.

I'm guessing Colin will be doing this film Nolan style. Most of the scenes will probably be 35mm like a normal film, and then probably the big sweeping scenery shots of beautiful Hawaii will be 65mm, if not some of the actions sequences as well. (Hopefully)

Frankly it's great to see that it's being shot on film at all as opposed to digital. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I only like Quentin Tarantino's first three films. All the characters in his movies tend to be one dimensional cartoon characters and his movies never have any interesting depth or character development. It's just silly unrealistic dialogue, references and homages, and everyone trying way too hard to be cool. Django was alright as a fun silly bloody action movie but that's about it. Nothing special.

I don't like Jennifer Lawrence or Bradley Cooper or Ryan Gosling. Leo DiCaprio is alright sometimes I guess. The Departed was his last 'believable' performance.

The Dark Knight was great, but Inception was just okay, and Dark Knight Rises sucked. Unless he stops with the big budget action crap and goes back to smaller more personal thrillers I don't really care about Chris Nolan anymore.

I really don't like Marvel films. Or Wes Anderson films. They always both have great casts though I keep seeing them. I guess that's my bad.

<TEXT> Boogie Nights has always felt like the third in a trilogy along with Goodfellas and Casino.

Both Goodfellas and Casino, and now Wolf of Wall Street, show off what I think Scorsese is best at, showing us a crazy stylized alluring at first, but ultimately corrupt and doomed, fast paced get-rich-quick type scenario, that gradually falls apart as we see more of the horrible things that happen as a consequence, and how money and power corrupt the characters.

Scorsese is great at taking the classic rise and fall, American dream type movie, showing it in a twisted and corrupt light, and cranking everything up to eleven. Boogie Nights is so clearly aiming for the exact same motif, just in the porn world instead of the gangster world. PTA totally understood and reinterpreted and nailed everything Scorsese was going for.

American Hustle felt like it was trying for a similar vibe but just did not hit the mark.

Everything in Boogie Nights, the shots, the scenes, the characters, the cinematography, the pacing, the music, even the way the camera moves, is all dripping with Scorsese's influence. It totally feels like a twisted alternate-porn version of Goodfellas and I love the hell out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keitel has been in just as many Scorsese movies as Leo has.

And it's really weird that there's randomnly Cinematographers/editors/whatever for some and not for others. Most of these filmmakers tend to use the same cinematographers and editors for most of their movies, most famously the Coens and Roger Deakins, but instead there's a sound department guy.

But most importantly this is not what muse means. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a shame that they don't do anything together anymore. They were clearly great friends in the 80s and 90s and loved working together. Although their careers have certainly gone in very different directions.

Joel was an assistant editor on Evil Dead. Joel and Ethan both wrote Crimewave, which Raimi directed. Sam Raimi had a cameo in Miller's Crossing. Joel and Ethan were credited as  'developers' for Darkman

Bruce Campbell was also in the Hudsucker Proxy, which Raimi co-wrote, had a small cameo in, and was the second unit director on.

Plus Raimi's A Simple Plan feels a lot like a Coen Brothers film.

And Sam Raimi and Joel Coen also both had cameos together in the 1985 Dan Akroyd and Chevy Chase comedy Spies Like Us for some reason. </TEXT>

I feel like the whole movie was steadily building up to this big epic finale, and then this scene was over within ten minutes to make room for a much more bland and disappointing final fight under the ocean.

Also I did not realize that part with the office building was done with a miniature. That's insanely cool.

<TITLE> How does the licensing for car games work? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was just wondering how do developers get the rights to use version cars and how complicated is the actual process?

It seems pretty simple, but then you have games that hardly feature any cars vs games with hundreds of cars, then a huge franchise like Forza not being able to use Porsches, then Need for Speed not having Ferraris for like a decade, but now their new game has them. Do developers pay to use a certain brand of car, and then use whatever they want, or do they have to pay by each car?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long Halloween is an absolute must. Read it right away. 

Arkham City is actually a phenomenal Batman story, a super fun game, and a great expansion and compliment to Arkham Asylum, so definitely get right into that as soon as possible. Don't bother with Arkham Origins.

Then just go through the recommended reading on this sub teddies sidebar  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whoa this looks insane and huge!

The first one worked so well because of the simple, no bullshit, real time plot and structure, so I was a little worried that this one would have too many characters and subplots and just end up being silly. 

But this looks just as action packed and awesome as the first. One of my most anticipated movies of next year for sure. These guys know how to take what could be a relatively generic and boring martial arts action movie idea and make it insane and fresh and unique.

Although I'm a little bummed that Joe Taslim can't return, but even more excited that they managed to work Yayan Ruhian back into the mix. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Casino, obviously. 

Boogie Nights is basically Goodfellas but with porn actors, one of my all time favorites. 

The Departed is kinda similar. Not exactly the same but still gangsters and definitely worth watching.

Maybe try Snatch, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos Way, Usual Suspects, Blow, True Romance, Chopper, American Hustle.
Scarface is like a crazy cartoon version. 

There are a lot of gangster movies out there, but very very few of them are as fast paced and naturalistic with an awesome soundtrack like Goodfellas. Casino and Boogie Nights are definitely the other movies I can think of that are quite the same.
Wolf of Wall Street seems to be the most Goodfellasy thing Scorcese has done since Goodfellas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The giant killer sperm from The Filth freaked me out. Not especially gory or anything bit it just made me feel dirty.

There were some pretty dark things happening in the first half (good half) of Irredeemable. Mostly kids getting killed in various ways.  

There was that terrible Lovecraftian book that Alan Moore wrote where a woman got raped by a fish demon and then later gave him a handjob. That was doubly fucked up because that was the genius behind Watchmen, Killing Joke and V for Vendetta writing that nonsense.

And of course anytime Garth Ennis gets all shock gore crazy, which is usually more fucked up than anything else on my list but I think I've become desensitized to him by now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The T-rex wasn't originally in the cargo hold. 

It was in that big steel cage that was sitting on the deck of the boat. We see it in that cage after Roland tranquilized it when everyone is leaving the island by helicopter.

Then when Malcolm and Sarah get on the boat you can see that the cage is torn open. The T-rex broke out of the cage, killed a bunch of people, and then chased people into the cargo hold or something, and a dying crew member closed the cargo doors.

There was that one hand inside the captain's cabin holding on to the steering wheel, which was weird, but I guess maybe the T-Rex was able to stick his head through the door to eat that guy or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you continue playing as all three characters once the campaign is over?

I've heard rumors about one if the characters potentially dying. I remember how much it sucked when John died at the end of Red Dead. I mean it worked great for story reasons, but since there was no warning I had to restart and play through the entire game again so that I could create an alternate save before the end so I could keep playing in the open world as John. 

So without giving too much away, will I be able to keep playing as all three characters when the story ends, or am I going to have to create an alternate save or something? </TEXT>

Unless they somehow left it out of the script and none of the actors noticed when halfway through the scene the director yelled cut and they brought on a prosthetic body cavity and spent hours prepping the animatronics. In the making of on the special edition DVD they say they didn't know exactly how it would pop out and what it would look like, and they said they were surprised by how much blood there was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like it a lot, but I dunno, I think it's moving a little too fast. It's only a ten issue series so it might not have the time it needs to really flesh out the story.

I love the premise, I love the build up, I love the mystery, I love this huge epic storyline they're trying to craft, I love all the ideas, but whenever something really spooky or interesting or atmospheric seems to be coming, the issue either ends, or we have some monster movie horror action jammed in. I feel like this book would be perfect if it was allowed to be a little slower and more tense and restrained. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No way. The suit is fine for the Toho films, but it simply wouldn't work at all for modern Western Audiences. I love the suit and the miniatures, they're really fun and great to look at, but CGI can do so much more than a suit can. It can move so much more realistically and perform in a much more advanced way. For the direction the 2014 Godzilla movie is going, a suit would not work at all. CGI is the best possible way to make a serious realistic and dynamic modern Godzilla movie for a wide audience.

The problem with the 1998 Godzilla movie, wasn't the CGI, it was everything else. CGI is a great amazing tool that can do mindblowing things that couldn't be done otherwise. It's all about how you use it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. I know we all just want to see Godzilla fight monsters, but everyone knows that the best Godzilla movies are for the most part just about humans vs Godzilla. Except the 1998 American version of course but that's for a whole bunch of other reasons.

Plus we already saw massive monster fights in Pacific Rim. Seeing people getting reports of Godzilla encounters out in the ocean or on islands, slowly discovering that this mind blowing beast somehow exists and the ramifications of such a thing, and then seeing it destroy human civilization while soldiers try hopelessly to hold him back would be awesome and scary and intense and something we've never seen done properly before. Once he gets to fighting other monsters it gets a bit more fun and silly. I kinda wish they had saved the other monsters for the sequels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just for comparison with other similar and recent destruction filled disaster/monster movies;


Pacific Rim's budget was $190M (A lot more than I had thought)

King Kong (2005) was $207M

Transformers 1 was $150M

Transformers 2 was $200M

Transformers 3 was $190M

Man of Steel was $225M

2012 was $200M

Cloverfield was $25M

Battle: Los Angeles was $75M

Battleship was $209M

GI Joe: Rise of Cobra was $175M

Armageddon was $140M

D-War was $75M (Most expensive Korean film of all time) 

Godzilla (1998) was $130M

Final Wars was $19M (The biggest budget ever for a Japanese Godzilla movie)

And Gareth Edward's Monsters was half a million bucks; $500,000

<TEXT> I'm not sure what the exact budget for this movie will end up being, nor do I know if Gareth Edwards is experienced enough to truly create a disaster movie of this scale, but this movie really needs to turn entire cities into radioactive wastelands.
So far the poster, interviews with the creators, and the Comic-Con teaser (which I haven't actually seen) seem to be hinting at exactly this, but I'm still not convinced. The problem is, again, I think the budget for this movie is a lot smaller than most disaster films, and Gareth isn't exactly experienced in epic large scale apocalyptic disaster films. Although he is talented and certainly knows how to stretch a budget

Pacific Rim was okay for what it was, but didn't deliver as much as I had hoped in the destruction department. After how disappointingly careful and harmless the 1998 Zilla was, bafflingly so for a Roland Emmerich film, and after seeing all the destruction based marketing so far, we really need a movie that makes Man of Steel and Transformers look tame in comparison.

If they want to set themselves apart, and deliver a truly terrifying and realistic and worthwhile reimagining of Godzilla, then they need to blow people's minds by showing off what a giant angry living nuclear battleship loose in a major city can do in a way no one has ever seen before.

I mean, surely if something as large as Godzilla were to actually exist, he'd do a lot more damage just walking around than just cracking the cement and smacking down buildings. He'd be a moving earthquake generator, and each footstep would permanently destroy the earth beneath him. 

Gareth and the writers/producers certainly seem to have a deep love for the original film, and the cast is absolutely superb, I just really hope they can use CG and modern Hollywood effects to take the wanton destruction and carnage of the Japanese films, and crank it up to 11. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not bad. Bit too much background noise going on for me though. I really hope they do a new version of the classic theme for this movie. Big and orchestral and epic. Based on how many references to the original there have already been already I'm sure they will.

I'm pretty disappointed that Michael Giacchino isn't doing the score. If you listen to the theme he made for Cloverfield you'll see that he would have been perfect. </TEXT>

Also I really don't like the look of his face. I get that they don't want him to look like Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy and are going for their own take on the character, but he just looks strange.

But hey, Just Cause 2 was stupid and weird and poorly acted and that was still some of the most fun I've had in a video game in a long long time. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Will GTA 5 allow us to replay missions like in BOGT? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-13 04:22:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of my favorite new features in BOGT was that after every story mission you were graded on your performance, and given stats about your accuracy, time, headshots, things like that, and then you could replay any story mission you wanted at any time to try to get better.

Imagine how much it would suck to play through an amazing mind blowing heist sequence, and then not be able to do it again. Especially now that you can upgrade your weapons and gear and personal stats, or replay it again but switching to different characters at different times. 

I don't remember for sure, but I'm pretty sure while replaying a mission in BOGT you don't earn any extra money or anything, so no need to worry about people replaying heists for bonus cash or stat upgrades.

Sure, replaying the whole game can be fun, but if you just want to replay a specific mission or show off a cool sequence to a friend, or replay a certain heist to try to get better at it, you don't want to replay the whole game and lose all your progress in the story and side missions, as well as your money and weapons and possessions. There's already a pretty much perfect mission replaying system in BOGT that they could hopefully use in GTA 5. It only adds tonnes more replay value to an already jam packed game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first one is a brilliant and fun and hilarious cheesy old school action adventure movie. Honestly, I think reinventing a classic Universal horror icon in the style of a classic pulp adventure serial was a perfect idea. It felt like Doc Savage Meets The Mummy. It was going for the same tone and tongue in cheek reference-filled style as Indiana Jones, and I think it nailed it. It was purposely campy and self aware, but without being too goofy or jokey. I'm not the biggest fan of Brendan Fraser, but he was great, the movie was fun, great special effects, and some genuinely creepy moments. Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but I absolutely loved it, and still do. Very much an under appreciated movie.


The second one sucked though. It's a shame that Stephen Sommers seemingly lost his self-aware campy style after this movie and went all ridiculous and terrible. </TEXT>

Godzilla (1954)

Destroy All Monsters (1968)

Godzilla - or Return of Godzilla (1984)

Godzilla vs Biollante (1989)

Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2 (1993)

Godzilla vs Desotroyah (1995)

Godzilla 2000 (2000)

Godzilla: Giant Monsters All Out Attack (2001)

Godzila Final Wars (2004)

I think these have the most action, most interesting Kaiju, and are just the most fun to watch. Some Godzilla movies can be super cheap and light on the Kaiju action, or just plain strange. These are all fairly simple and accessible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The missed punches don't show how overmatched Batman is when Bane is still reacting to the hit. Not once during the fight did I think "wow Batman is out of his league!" or "whoa Batman is finally outmatched!" I could only think "Yikes this is poorly done."

There's a big difference between being deliberately choreographed in a sloppy messy fashion to portray the characters in a certain way, and plain bad choreography where punches miss clearly by inches and the other fighter acts like he got hit,  unrealistic moves, people swing their arms nowhere near an opponent just so the other fighter can block it, obviously awkward positioning, and Bane doing a sloppy little jump spin in the middle of a fight and Batman just sort of waits to get hit.

The negative things I said about that fight weren't the point of the fight, they weren't choices by Nolan or the choreographer. They were mistakes and sloppy filmmaking and poor stunt work.

The lead up was basically Batman saying,  "Take me to this movie's villain so we can have a fight scene." Then there's a weird awkwardly paced build up, before Bane and Batman finally clash in a pretty averagely choreographed slow fight with lots of missed punches and cheesy moments. I usually really like Nolan movies but his fight scenes are always terrible, and DKR was one of his weakest films by far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Roland's last movie 2012 was like that as well. It was so tonally inconsistent that it really drove me crazy. 

There's a scene where a man tries to make up with his son over the phone after not speaking to him for years. Right as the son picks up the phone a huge earthquake hits and the father listens to his son die. Then, as the old man cries, a giant tidal wave comes and kills him and like a thousand other people. Then there's a giraffe hanging from a helicopter and John Cusack's daughter says she doesn't pee her pants anymore. 

Also, a scene where a chihuahua walks across a tightrope while a wife angrily gives her husband the finger, all to goofy cartoony music, and then the husband falls to his death while his children watch and scream.

That movie was fucking weird   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole point of Die Hard was supposed to be that it wasn't a typical action hero guy like Arnie or Sly. That's why they casted a romantic comedy tv actor. Bruce only became known as an action star afterwards. If Die Hard was made today it'd be more likely to be someone like... Jeez I actually have no idea...

<TEXT> Both consoles have 8GB of RAM, but the Xbox One OS takes up 3 GB, and the PS4's OS takes up 1. So PS4 has 7GB of Ram devoted to games and Xbox One only has 5. Also PS4 uses GDDR 5 and Xbox One uses GDDR 3. Plus, PS4 is cheaper, has better exclusives, support for indie developers, no online passes, and PS Plus gives you free games every month. It's still all around a cheaper and more powerful machine.

EDIT: And a 50% more powerful GPU </TEXT>

<TEXT> We Australians really don't have any big international pop culture icons at all. But Mad Max was different. Mad Max was revolutionary, and has gone down in pop culture history. All current post apocalyptic fiction is based in some way on Mad Max. 

Mad Max was our culture's biggest contribution to the larger pop culture universe. And to just ignore a huge part of the character and fiction is just so pointless and silly. Why take away such an important aspect of Mad Max to just make him a typical gravelly voiced American protagonist? 

Mad Max was one of the biggest, if not the most important, pop culture icon we had, it's kind of offensive to try to mess that up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmmm. That seems kinda generic and disappointing. 

I was never super keen on the idea of the hand to hand combat. The car battles and open world wasteland were what were appealing to me. Did the car battle seem over the top and fun and disregarding the laws of physics like Just Cause? Did it seem like you could have done lots of crazy stuff during the car battle, and that the player has lots of control over the shooting and harpooning, or was it fairly scripted?

I heard a dev say the map was as big as Just Cause 2 and filled with side missions and random encounters and stuff to do, so maybe there might still be some potential when the game is further along.

Super bummed about there not being any Australian accents though. I'm still really interested in the game but it seems a lot less impressive than I was hoping. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm super interested in this game, and I'm surprised not more people on Reddit are as well. It sounds fantastic and fun, an open world post apocalyptic action game in the Mad Max universe from the creators of Just Cause. Apparently there's a demo people have seen, but I'm finding it really hard to find anything about it.

My most important question is are the characters Australian or not

We Australians don't have a lot of internationally known pop culture icons, so it'd be a shame if Max became another gravelly voiced American.

EDIT: Just noticed in the trailer that Max gets out of the right side of his car, not the left, that could be a good sign that this game is set in Australia, despite the American accent of the dude on the ground. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once my old man saved up and bought a real nice car. It was a Holden Monaro, the nicest bloody car he had ever owned. In fact the only car he had ever owned that wasn't a banged up old ute. He had a DVD player put in the dash, and that night me and him sat in the carport in his Monaro and watched The Castle together. We couldn't have food or drink in the car but the seats were very comfy and reclined a fair bit. It was fantastic. I will always have fond memories of this movie because of that. </TEXT>

It looked brilliantly fun and over the top and stylized and everything my young dinosaur-obsessed mind wanted from a game. But then it never came out, and it broke my heart. I've never really gotten over it.

But now this game comes along. I don't want to get too excited because it's clearly not the same and I have to be realistic in my expectations, but my god am I ever pumped for this.

<TEXT> That it won't eventually come out on next gen consoles. This game looks perfect to me, aside from the small graphical/technical issues that come with the game being a bit too ambitious for current gen. Things like rough textures, anti aliasing, frame rate drops and pop in are all something that we have to deal with in current gen open world games, and even though they don't ruin the game, it's a shame that it comes out so close to the release of a console that would fix those issues.

Plus I'm not sure how well they can plan to continue supporting the game with DLC and mutliplayer if everyone's off playing the new consoles. </TEXT>

Superman speaks with his father through computer holograms/visions/in the afterlife lots of times before as we have seen, so that'd be fine, but surely they wouldn't change the mythos to make him alive, and then spoil it in a trailer </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do we know if Sony is doing a similar thing?
I'm assuming their games will be also installing to the Hard Drive. Maybe the disc itself will act as the game ownership license? Like you still install the game, but you can't play it without simply having the disc in the machine, as opposed to an online pass or key code thing. That would certainly solve the problem and make it act basically the same as physical disc games do now. </TEXT>

How many action set pieces are there? I've heard the big finale takes place in Hong Kong, and that's what's mostly been shown in the trailers, and then the opening action scene takes place in San Francisco. Is this accurate?

<TEXT> Obviously Kavinsky has his own radio station, so we got our awesome techno electro stuff there.

A country station is confirmed, as is a classic rock station.

I think we can assume there'll be at least one hip hop station. Maybe a classics and a newer station.

And even thought R* hasn't mentioned it Lazlow will surely return for his talk show.

News shows will surely be back as they were in GTA 4.

Radio Gaga is in there, that might be on the classic rock station. But, hopefully, the classic rock station will be a bit more 'rock'ish and Radio Gaga will be appearing on a Vice City FM type station.

There were a lot of unreleased songs for a Metal station in Lost and Damned, so hopefully we'll get some of those here.

I know R* doesn't like to repeat songs (at least to my knowledge) but I hope Free Bird shows up again.

<TEXT> That's the one thing I didn't like about it. Otherwise it was a really fantastic fun action movie. But once it started going down *that* path in the third act it felt a little off. It kinda cheapened what was supposed to be the most emotional and important part of the movie. Also I thought the cameo towards the end was dumb.

But pretty much if you liked the first you'll like this. Fun and cool and fast paced and funny and with a surprisingly interesting and unpredictable story. A little bit darker and more serious, but nothing drastic. Maybe not quite as good as the first one, but its definitely worth seeing. I really really liked it. </TEXT>

I am excited as hell. Shaun and Fuzz are two of my all time favorite movies and I never get sick of watching them over and over again. Edgar, Simon and Nick know how to pull off some of the most fun and fast paced, and yet incredibly intelligent and well crafted comedies you're gonna find today.

Honestly, in my opinion, this trilogy might even be revered years from now along with other brilliant cult comedies like Big Lebowsky, Airplane and Dr Strangelove.

He's a very busy man but I get the distinct impression he doesn't really read many comic books these days - Marvel, DC or otherwise - and is interested in other creative ventures, so I doubt he really has the time or desire to check out the in-game storyline here.

<TEXT> I figure most people here have played the game with all the crazy posts about it recently, so I thought this would get an answer. I haven't bought it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually.

So I was wondering, what happens if you use Doomsday or Superman or Flash's super move while on the Watchtower map? The animation for those three supers definitely can only take place on the earth. Even Hawkgirl, Captain Marvel and Black Adam's super moves deal with the characters being below the clouds. Do the characters just magically teleport down to earth for the super move and then magically teleport back to the Watchtower to continue the fight? </TEXT>

Harley Quinn

Hawkgirl

Joker

Killer Frost

Lex Luthor

Raven

Shazam

Sinestro

Solomon Grundy

Superman

Wonder Woman

That's 24 in total, and it appears there will be another 4 characters available as DLC with the season pass, which brings us to 28 characters. So if you could pick any 28 characters to be in Injustice, who would you have gone with?

<TITLE> My five director choices for Bond 24 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-10 11:54:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since there's still no confirmed director for the next Bond film, I thought it might be fun if we just discussed who we'd like to see take over from Mendes.
Here are my top five choices, plus I think they're all fairly realistic.

1 - Martin Campbell

Directed two of the best bonds (in my opinion) and while it might be a safe or boring choice to bring him back, we'd be assured a great film. Plus his non-Bond films always end up being disasters anyway, so he might as well stick with subject matter he can pull off.

2 - Edward Zwick

Last Samurai, Blood Diamond, Defiance (with Daniel Craig) He just seems like exactly the kind of director who could make a great Bond film.

3 - Guy Ritchie

A lot of rumours are floating around about him taking over, and while it seems like a strange choice to me, the Sherlock Holmes filmed certainly showed that he's capable.

4 - Joe Wright

Another name that I've heard being mentioned a lot. I actually haven't seen anything of his besides Hannah, but I've heard good things.

5 - Matthew Vaughn

I'm not the biggest Vaughn fan in the world, but Layer Cake (with Daniel Craig) was pretty great, and the first half of Xmen First Class with all the Magneto revenge stuff is brilliant, and convinces me that he could potentially nail Bond.

EDIT

Bonus Director suggestion - David Yates

I wasn't super into Harry Potter, but the last couple movies looked incredible, and had some really impressive action sequences and some really cool and interesting directorial choices.

So what do you guys think? 

Who would you like to see take over Bond 24 and why?

(Other choices that would be too weird or unrealistic or unlikely, just for fun, would be David Fincher, Tomas Alfredson, Kenneth Branagh, Pierre Morel, Chan Wook Park, Niels Arden Oplev, Luc Besson, and of course, Christopher Nolan) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can we start a petition to get the game 'BC' back into production? </TITLE>

<TEXT> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_(video_game)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POZEB-H_k_0

http://au.gamespot.com/bc/

BC was a video game under development by Lionhead Studios, but it was cancelled in 2004. I remember being so so incredibly excited for it as a kid, and I still haven't really gotten over it. It was going to be super huge and elaborate, super violent, really intelligent, but mostly really fun and over the top and a bit goofy.

Basically it was an open world RPG/action adventure game where you take control of a tribe of cavemen and have to fight dinosaurs, killer apes, sabretooth tigers, and other prehistoric monsters to ensure the survival and evolution of your species. Upgrade your caveman, craft new weapons and potions, learn magic, expand your campsite, manage your tribe, hunt for food or survival or fun.

Also dinosaurs, you guys. More games need dinosaurs.

Just imagining a game of this scale and awesomeness on the next generation of consoles and PCs makes me think they really need to get this project going again. No other game is like this, it's a totally new and original and exciting crazy fun sounding idea.
At best I can guess it'd be like a prehistoric Skyrim meets Turok meets FarCry 3, only campy and silly and super violent with dinosaurs and monsters, and most importantly, bright colours and a fun cartoony art design, like games used to be before they got all super serious and big budget.

I would donate half the organs in my body to bring this game back. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-01-01 15:17:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My sister is 14, and she's always been very smart and good at reading. She's read the typical teenage girl stuff, but nothing really outside what everyone else her age is reading, and she never read very often. But recently when the Hunger Games movie came out, I mentioned that it was very similar to Battle Royale.

She seemed really interested so I got out my copy and borrowed it to her. She read it super quick and seemed to really love it. So I gave her Enders Game, and she loved that too. So I started giving her some of my favourite books, and told her she can read anything on my bookshelf. (as long as she asks first)

Now she doesn't want to read the normal stuff her friends read or her teachers reccommend her, now she wants the next book by Vonnegut or Gaiman or Twain. She even came home from school one day and said her English teacher mentioned that they'd be reading Animal Farm the next year, and that the teacher was super impressed that she had already read through Animal Farm and 1984 several times. 

Now we can talk about awesome literature and we have even more in common. I feel like we've bonded closer as friends now and we always have something interesting to talk about. This is the first time I've gotten anyone into reading and I guess I'm just super proud. Thought I'd share. :)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Strange similarities between Pan's Labyrinth and The Shining. (Spoilers for both) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-11 04:45:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've watched both these movies recently, for the thousandth time, and I just realized some weird similarities between the plots and events of both movies, and I was wondering if anyone else noticed this or maybe knew if it was intentional or anything.

Not only do the plots of both films involve a dysfunctional (to say the least) family being forced to live together in a remote building for extended periods of time with little contact with the outside world, but both films also have a climax at the end where the child in said dysfunctional family is chased through a maze by their murderous father.

Not only that, but both films remain relatively ambiguous as to whether or not the supernatural elements of the story are actually occurring, or are just the result of the main character's deteriorating mental state, with the exception of a scene in both films at the start of the final act where the supernatural beings help the main character escape from an otherwise inescapable imprisonment. (Jack is freed from the pantry by Grady, Ofelia is freed from her bedroom by the Faun)

So what do you guys think? Coincidence? Intentional parallel? Bit of a reach? Do you guys know of any other films with oddly similar elements? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-12-11 02:23:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When the New 52 started, Animal Man and Swamp thing were my favorite titles. They were so unique and weird and dark and well written and funny and fucked up. Both their first arcs were absolutely incredible and they quickly became my favorite current comics. Snyder and Lemire are definitely among the best writers working in comics today, and I have no problem at all with long story arcs. But then the lead up to Rotworld started and both titles seemed to just be spinning their wheels. Especially Animal Man. I love both characters, and I love the Rot, and the characters were great on their own in the normal world, but it hasn't been grabbing me like it used to. And now that Rotworld is underway I'm not really into it at all. Plus now Snyder is leaving Swamp Thing so I'm even less enthused. I really hope Lemire and whoever takes over after Snyder have some awesome unique stand alone stories because this whole crossover event has felt really drawn out and disappointing to me. </TEXT>

But what was the point of the final scene where Strangelove freaks out and stands up? I totally got and loved the conversation they were having about basically restarting the arms race in a hundred years after the apocalypse, very funny and poignant, but what was happening to Strangelove? What was the Russian guy doing with that clock thing? Why end the movie there on that final line? What does it mean? Or is it just a funny line to go out on with no significance? I feel like I missed something and probably need to watch it again. 
Also I wish that alternate pie fight ending was kept. That sounds brilliant. </TEXT>

I'm really sick of alien invasions and apocalyptic scenarios and anything big like that. The first acts of alien stories are always my favourite. Where it's just mysterious sightings and media hysteria and paranoia and suspense and all that jazz.

If anyone knows of some more slow-burning alien sci-fi books, that are less about alien invasions and more about the mystery and conspiracies and suspense, and most importantly, if you know of any books that can really give you something to think about, I'd love to hear about them!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Grant Morrison and Barry Sonnenfeld have been hyping this thing up like crazy, and it looks like a nice fun bit of insanity, so I picked it up today.

Did anyone else know that this was not at all a complete story? I paid 20 bucks for this graphic novel, and it's 3 or 4 chapters, basically an introductory first act, and the Dinosaurs and Aliens don't even fight.
The book was actually pretty cool. Nothing special, but a lot better than the silly premise would make it seem. I was actually really getting into it and enjoying where the story seemed to be going, and I was looking forward to exploring the crazy Dinosaur culture as well as the complex 'villain' aliens. But then it just suddenly ends before anything happens.  

I'm assuming there must be more books coming, but for 20 bucks I was really expecting that I'd actually get the full story, not just the first act. Especially since that it didn't say Part 1 or anything on it and it wasn't advertised as being an incomplete novel. I can't find anything about when, or even if there's more coming.

Maybe I missed something or I'm just dumb. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Could Animal Man adopt Superman's powers? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-11-29 12:31:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't know a whole lot about comics, so forgive me if there is an obvious loophole here.
But if Animal Man and Superman were in a fight for some reason, could Animal Man simply adopt Superman's powers to fight him? He can adopt the powers of pretty much any creature alive or dead, and I remember he even adopted Bwana Beast's powers that one time. Couldn't he just start taking powers from Superman and Flash and Captain Marvel and Aquaman and other heroes instead of just animals?

What is the limit to Animal Man's amazing and underappreciated power? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best tablet for comics? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-09-12 09:57:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've only ever bought graphic novels and trade paperbacks from my local comic store, but now seems like as good a time as any to start buying comics monthly now that DC has rebooted, so I was wondering what you guys use to read your comics digitally. 

An IPad is way out of my price range, but I was thinking a Nook or a Pandigital Novel would be a good choice. Do I have to download a DC app to download comics or is there a website I should use? What about other more obscure comics from other brands? Can I subscribe to titles I like? I've never bought eBooks or used a tablet so I have no idea how they work.

Thanks in advance, guys! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gotham Noir or Nine Lives? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-28 13:30:19 </DATE>

<TEXT> I was looking for a cool noir-style Elseworlds tale, and I stumbled across these two titles. 

I don't have a lot of comic stores where I live, so pretty much the only chance I have of reading these is to just order them online, but I'm wondering if anyone here had read them and which one you guys thought was better?
They both sound sorta similar. 

[Gotham Noir](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman:_Gotham_Noir) stars Gordon as an alcoholic detective and was written by Ed Brubaker, and [Nine Lives](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman:_Nine_Lives) stars Dick Grayson as a PI and was featured on IGN's list of the best Batman graphic novels. Anyone have any opinions on which one makes for a better read? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey Batfans, what other Batman books should I add to my collection? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-07-25 13:23:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been a Batman fan for only a couple of years, but I think I've started a fairly cool little collection of around ten or so graphic novels. 
Today I purchased Black and White volumes 1, 2  amp; 3, I also have Year One, Dark Knight Returns, Hush, The Long Halloween, Dark Victory, The Killing Joke and Gotham by Gaslight.
As much bigger Batman fans than myself, what other great trade paperbacks/graphic novels do you guys recommend I check out?
If you could give me a little info on the titles you think I should read so I know what they're like that'd be fantastic.
I hear Grant Morrison has done some really good stuff with Batman, but I'm looking for mostly self contained stories.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Would you choose the voice of Freddie Mercury, the guitar skills of Hendrix and the songwriting skills of Springsteen and become a rock god?
Or would you choose the creative minds of Einstein, Tesla and Galileo and become a brilliant mad scientist so as to take over the world?
Or would you take the witty word-wrangling skills of Douglas Adams, the Piano skills of Beethoven, and the voice of Isaiah Mustafa and just become everyone's favorite drinking buddy?
You can choose any random combination of people from history, living or dead. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can Reddit please help me cheer up a Cancer patient with funny YouTube videos </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-02-07 03:16:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey Reddit.
I'm kinda new here. I haven't made a whole lot of posts or anything on Reddit before, I've just been browsing and enjoying the website for a little while, so I don't really know how these things work, but I thought maybe you guys could help me out with something.

My friend sent me a message today saying that her aerobics coach has been diagnosed with cancer and is bedridden and refusing to let people come see her. So my friend has decided to start sending her funny YouTube videos to cheer her up, and was wondering if I could help. I've sent a few, but I thought you guys would have tonnes of hilarious videos up your sleeves. So if you guys could maybe post the funniest YouTube videos you know of, I could link my friend to this post and she'd have tonnes of videos to send to her coach.

I have no idea what exactly this person finds funny or what kind of videos she likes or anything, nor do I know what kind of cancer she has, but I can fill you guys in once my friend replies to me. In the meanwhile, if you guys could just post me some funny videos I'd bee incredibly grateful.

Thanks! </TEXT>
