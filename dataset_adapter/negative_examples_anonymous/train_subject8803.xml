<TEXT> Well, i think he did. Thats why they went looking for it and found the problem. Ofc he doesnt know excactly what the problem was but i think no one wouls.  The point is he noticed it first in Q1 and there was really no time to fix it in qualy so he just set out to do the best lap he could do and get it sorted after. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of people are missing the point. Yes Sainz is more consistent and quicker in qualifying, but he hasn't raised my heartbeat once so far this season. Max just is an exciting driver to watch. That's what this article is about.

The No.1 complaint is that f1 is getting boring, more exciting drivers means less boring races. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question! i have a few theories

I think a big factor is that homeless people sort of ask for money. This makes us feel uncomfortable as we get more or less forced into the idea of giving the money. When a homeless person asks you for money.
On the other hand when we donate money to a celeb we feel less forced in to it. You created that idea yourself and that makes for a stronger desicion to actually go trough with the action.

A Second possible explanation could be that when you see your favourite celebrity you feel happy and you are inclined to show that you like them and donate to their lives. A homeless person doesn't look happy and doesn't give us the same happiness. We are more generous when we are happy (or less when we are not) thus you are less inclined to give away your money. 

Last but not least, a celebrity we tend to donate to most of the time creates a "free" product / enternainment. So when we donate to them we tend to feel like we get worth for our money. When giving money to a homeless person we can only guess what happens with the money. And because of our prejudices about homeless people our guesses aren't that positive, hence we again feel less inclined to support to that cause.

**TL;DR its all about how it makes us feel** </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can keep a close eye on [Ticketswap](www.ticketswap.nl) Its a safe(ish) website where people sell their tickets if they bought one but are not able to go. Other than that you can search for the facebook event, at most concerts there is someone who tries to sell their ticket (mostly last minute though and there is a possibility you get scammed) 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Get a lock that is more expensive then your bike.

This is gold advice (but a bit over the top) you can get a really decend bike for 50-80 euro's (or 10-20 form a junk) and a really good lock for +-40. 

also, a bike stealing friend of mine once told me: "if your bike is not attached to something like a post or a rail with its lock, then its not locked" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I normally get 4 in early-midgame PvT, cutting that bio in half on ramps an chokepoints in awesome, later often only 2 because i wont use them anyway. (only pop GS before storming and so on) in PvP most of the time 2, mostly for GS as well in every fight. In PvZ i get about 4-8, dependig on my own and mostly the strat of my opponent. But the best thing about sentries is: scout every 1.5 - 2 mins for bases, tech changes, army comp and so on with hallu phoenix, in every matchup! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I (diamond Protoss) just started playing around a bit on the unranked ladder as Zerg (my zerg skills are bronze/silver i think). 
I got matched vs a platinum protoss player and lost quite badly.
after the match i noticed that his league symbol changed to diamond.
So after a quick chat i found out he queued for the ranked ladder, and got promoted to diamond after the match. I think this is a bit unfair. **What do you guys think?**

TL;DR: Opponent gets promoted on the back of my diamond protoss MMR, while I played offrace on the unranked ladder. Fair/unfair? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used a build like this in WoL a lot, but it indeed does work vs 3 hatch openings in HotS.
I don't have an exact build order, but here is roughly what i do:

FFE, if you can gateway before cannon (scout no early pool)
2 gasses
gateway 100% -- cyber core.
zealot (send to watchtower/third base if you 
chronoboost in probes until cybercore is finished, after that only chrono boost cybercore
+1 att @ 100gas (chrono when you can)
stalker.
3 gates @50% cybercore
stop probe production
3/4/5 more gates
forward pylons
should be hitting around 8:30-9:00 i think.

Hope this helps! </TEXT>
