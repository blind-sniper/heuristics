They could do a massive debt writeoff and keep Greece in the EU in exchange for a package of economic liberalization, investment, and massive tax overhaul.  Or they could let it go and play Russian Roulette with the economy. Either way, the Greek debt is going to have written down to pennies on the dollar to prevent economic chaos in Europe.  </TEXT>

The US could not tolerate having a Soviet proxy state in central asia and so we were willing to support the Islamist rebels without thinking about future consequences. Which was the problem with most Cold war policy anyways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What a bunch of crap.  Why does these religious hucksters accept that the fact that the USA is a secular nation and not a Christian nation? They should accept that they are living under the same conditions that Jesus was living under when he was in the Roman Empire.  There was rampant homosexuality in Rome and probably more than there was today.  Did Jesus target the rampant homosexuality that existed in Roman culture? No, he was more concerned about people following the way of the cross and redeeming themselves in Christ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want to leave cheap, you can live in a sober living arrangement. However, you have to a person that alcohol and drug-free to do that. You do not need to be an alcoholic to live in those places, you just need to drug and alcohol free. Those places usually have the cheapest room rentals in the county.

The downside of those places are
(i) Abusive managers (my one loves to yell at people)
(ii) Curfews (which really do not matter at Action Alliance or Ready to Recover houses as long you tell the manager that you are out for the night)
(iii) Places that require meeting cards.
(iv) Annoying roommates

Try to find a place does not require a meeting card because if you are drug and alcohol free, you are abiding by the house rules and you really do not need meetings unless you are in recovery.

And make sure that you find a house manager (aka: landlord) that tries not to snoop in your personal life. I still hang out with my Burning Man friends all of the time and no one tells me what to do.  But I have over two years clean and really active in recovery and my UU church in Costa Mesa.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the hardest time with sitting down to watch a TV show especially when it does not interest.  I can sit down and watch an espisode of GOT fine, but I struggle to watch reruns a lot of other shows.  I also live in at house where there is one TV and I have to be especially sensitive of other people's TV needs.  I usually spend my time on the computer where i can surf website to website and look at what interests me.  However, I believe that it aggravates my ADHD even more. I do not struggle with problem at work where I have lazer sharp focus and can do my jobs for hours on end even it is especially repetive.  Yet, trying to watch a TV show to be a difficult ordeal and I just cannot sit down and watch a TV show until its conclusions unless it is GOT where I force myself to watch the entire episode.  And I never watch movies because I know that I cannot stay still because I am on the computer the entire time.  Do people with ADHD struggle with same struggles that I do and just avoid TV </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> However, one huge difference between Bernie and Obama campaigns in the 2008 campaign is that the Bernie's race and gender will neutralize the Obama racism that happened during the 2008 campaign.  However, the Republicanism will use the socialist death label to death and use Sander's anti-interventionist to drum up that Sanders will bring the terrorist back.  Unlike Hillary, the GOP could not resort to the personal character attacks aganist Bernie that they can use aganist Hillary Clinton all of the time.  

In some ways, Bernie would be attacked on policy stances and would not be attacked on race, gender, and personal character attacks that Obama or Hillary faced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but what about financial stablity. Financial stablity is defined as "Just because your business is making money doesnt mean its stable. Stability is the ability to withstand a temporary problem, such as a decrease in sales, lack of capital or loss of a key employee or customer. Analyzing your cash flow and a variety of negative scenarios will help you determine whether or not your business is financially stable."

That is very important.  No profits = no jobs.  We are not going to be in socialist utopia any time soon and lot of Americans will not accept it. I prefer socialism but I am also a pragmatic realist that understands that capitalism will be the system of the US for a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem about Labor is that it did not properly branding.  Branding is "your promise to your customer. It tells them what they can expect from your products and services, and it differentiates your offering from your competitors".  Labor did not promise any real change or any difference than the conservative problem.  Also, the Conservatives feed into the white's view of xenophobia and will make "Fortress England". Also, a lot of white people in general that I know support the business agenda because they in some day that they will benefit from the system that primary favors the rich instead of realizing the system in the long run is unsustainable and needs to replace with something else.  Therefore, in some ways, the proletarians are the dumb ones themselves because they favor the burgerious agenda.  But P.T Barnum once wrote "There is a sucker born in every minute". </TEXT>

<TEXT> One advantage about OCTA compared to Metro is that it is great to have county-wide public transit system. One pass, one bus system.  Despite my prefereance for Metro over the OCTA, I do no understand why there is so many transit agencies in LA County.  There should be only four in my opinion: LBT, Antelope Valley, FTA, and Metro because those bus systems serve vast population bases.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, Metro is a far better cry than OCTA.  Here in OC, we have no light rail and it is impossible to access the bus in certain parts of the county.  If you live in Santa Ana, Anaheim, or Costa Mesa, than the best comparison to OCTA is how Long Beach Transit operates.  For the rest of the county (especially in the South), RTA is a better comparison.  But Metro is superior to the OCTA and LBT. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-19 01:33:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As an aspie, how do you think about all of these people participating in the massive fundraisers for autism like this held in Pasadena. 
(http://abc7.com/society/families-friends-gather-for-walk-now-for-autism-speaks-at-rose-bowl/668403/)

My attitude is like Meh.  The problem about these fundraisers is that they are trying to spend massive amounts of money of trying to autistic people into neurotypicals.  I think the money is better spent on educating the public about autism and how to deal properly with autism.  I think the money should go into teaching social skills to autistic people so they learn how to interact with people, but also teach NTs that autistic people have a unique way of communicating and learn how to respect it. I am much more of the high functioning end of autism where my autism allows for normal social relationships with NTs but I still also suffer from severe ADHD that is also the root at my autism.  My ADHD and not my social skills is what holding me down in the professional workplace.   I would also like the money to spent on teaching self-awareness skills as well, but not at the expense at trying to change  who autistic people.

<DATE> 2015-04-18 21:13:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I left a high-paying government job after ten years of working there because I could no longer maintain the security clearance. I was never fired and I left my own accord.  I got two DUIs in a year.  

In my application, I put the reason why I left my job was for "Personal and Health" reasons. I do not provide the details unless asked.  WHen I do, I tell the employer that I have two years in clean in twelve step programs.  I do not explain any of the details of DUIs, but rather that I have two year clean today and I no longer drink.  I also participating in an unpaid internship for autism people that helps with my soft skills which actually has helped me a lot. 

The question: Is being honest with the employer and reassuring to the employer that I am in recovery with multiple years of clean time is this best thing to do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The headline is misinforming.  Yes, Mumia is convicted cop killer but there is substantial doubt on the conviction's basis. 

Based on the recent rash of police abuse towards Blacks, Mumia claims of innocence might be actually be correct or more realistically, the murder was caused by the police officer's own actions that resulted in manslaughter than pre-meditated first degree murder.  

For me, Mumia is commentator on social justice issues and that is why I listen to him.  The legal circumstances of his case are of no concern to me.  The Philadelphia police had an extensive track record of discriminatory behavior towards African-Americans especially during the times of Mumia case so the allegations against are considered to be murky and unresolved in my opinion.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Americans are too strongly individualistic and competitive in nature.  For socialism to work in the US, you need to have a market-based system, but one based on spirit of cooperation and egalitarianism that rewards workers for individual efforts and teamwork efforts.  However, it has to be competive as well because that in the American DNA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I prefer a market-based capitalistic system.  However, I have a very high distrust of corporations and wealthy because they do not act in the best interest of the country.  Therefore, I prefer the government to heavily regulate industry, have the power to break monopolies, and allow for unions as internal control against management abuse of the worker.  I also believe that workers should have the ability to form their collective businesses and find  a way to share a profit from it.

However, I do not prefer top-down command economy because we have many, many examples  of thosein world-history and most of them result in an authoritarian governments and inequitable distribution of resources. (which include the USSR, Cuba, Venezuela, and other countries)  The proper system is to have a market-based system where the government acts a referee to prevent industrial abuses, massive inequality, and allows workers to control the resources on their own.  However, the government should not have the ability to bail out inefficient firms or pick winners/losers in industry.  It should be a competitive, workers-based market socialism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I quit two years ago and I have almost two years of recovery.  Being a recovered alcoholic takes a lot of time and energy because you have to invest a lot of time into maintaining your recovery and make sure that you do not fall back into alcoholic behavior which is a precursor to relapse.  I go to about three to four meetings a week, participate in twelve-step service commitments, and also attend a Unitarian Universialist church to work the spiritual portion of my program.  

You can do it on willpower but if you are doing that, I would live in a sober living at least for the first year.  If you go the twelve-step route, you will a better shot of recovery as long you can accept a program of self-improvement to deal with your drinking and have some form of spirituality (which does not require a belief in God unlike a lot of people in AA will tell you).  You also should to attend some sort of rehab program (inpatient) as well.  If your insurance does not accept inpatient programs, than I will check the providers that the drug courts use for their clients because usually their rehab costs are usually 75%-85% cheaper than most inpatient programs that the insurance companies pay for.  </TEXT>

It fails to properly account for the recapture the cost of the asset over the useful of the life asset. It also "creative accounting" allowing the companies to have higher profits for Wall Street than actual profits that they when it is reported to the IRS.  Again, creative accounting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am worried that one day that I am going to have move away from Southern California because of the massive drought that we have.  It seems that there needs to be mass migration to the North as the West drys up, the North will become habitable.  Unless we want to pay $10.00 for gasoline and ride the OCTA/Metro everywhere, I just feel real cynical that things are going to change because there is not the will to change things even this is a clearly obvious threat but nobody wants to do the self-sacrificing to change things. </TEXT>

Changing the minds of white Southern voters will be hard, but it can be done if you run a socially conservative, but a person who supports the economic views of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could win down there.  Pick up the black and hispanic vote and you have winner.  

In reality, a conservative Christian who properly follows the views of Christ teachings (in my opinion) would be socially conservative on abortion and other issues, but side with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on economic issues. Bascially, that is what the current Pope Francis's view. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The facts of the story demonstrate that the man is mentally disable.  The problem is the law where the bar is set too high claiming mental disablity.  The death penalty should be reserved for cold-blooded killers not for mentally

Governors have a fear to commute sentences because they fear a conservative, bloodthirsty electorate.  Instead of fearing the conservative electorate, do what is right and commute the sentence. Or better yet, commute all of the sentences on death row if you cannot trust the courts to do its job.

The death penalty works when the bar is set high for the death penalty and there are more commutations than executions.  And then real cold blooded killers who deserve will get what they deserve.  </TEXT>

Real justice would have been
Dick Cheney = Life Sentence Without Parole
George Bush = 25 years + 3 years post-release supervision

Then we could have gone Lloyd Bankfield, Vikram Pandit, and James Dimon for banking fraud with terms of years between twenty to fourty year plus five years of post-release supervision.

<TEXT> I think Texas should be told that the death penalty should be banned.  While I like the speed that they get guilty executed, there are too many cases where 

If the governor had an active history of commuting/pardoning death sentences, then I would have agree with Texas approach.

I support the death penalty but I also aware that they are many cases that where innocence does occur.  If I were a politician, I would have no problem commuting death sentences.  In my state (California), they are too slow to execute the guilty so victims get no justice waiting for a death sentence.  I think California should just scrap death penalty and make it life without parole.  

If state has too much of history of executing innocent or mentally ill inmates, then its death penalty should be scrapped. In conclusion, I have no problem executing the guilty, but I also have a real problem with executing the mentally ill or innocent. Too many Southern governors are the type who inject the needle and ask questions later.  Also, lethal injections take longer execute people than short-drop hanging in Iran so maybe we should just scrap the whole concept of the death penalty in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The real systemic problem is that police procedures are written to allow this to happen.  The jury has too much discretion in determining whether there was allowable use of force.  The officer has too much discretion allowing him to do this.  The rules need to be tightened to narrow officers ability for using of lethal force.  Violations of the law can result in criminal prosecution for involuntary manslaughter.  The activist class cries for justice, but does not look at the real reason which is the lax police procedures for use of force in this case. 

If the grand jury testimony is to believe, the officer should use had use a nightstick, pepper spray, or better yet, a tazer.  I have watched a bunch of episodes of COPS and the officers on this show (who are well trained) would use the taser.  If this guy had a taser and did not use it, than I would vote him guilty for involuntary manslaughter.  Unfortunate, none of the stories that i read this morning failed to mention that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.  This is because big business lacks the internal controls to properly self-monitor itself and needs detail guidance from the government on how to do so.
2.  Government provides too much regulation to business instead of just saying "no" to a business practice and not permitting that practice in the first place.  Just saying "no" might be cheaper to a business than 'Yes can do this, but there is billion of rules to follow".  Maybe, business would rather have the practice outright banned and not paying the money to comply with regulation that allows them to engage in the practice but have all kinds of hoops to jump through in order to engage in the allowed pratice. </TEXT>

What we need to realize in society that there needs to arms-length distance between government and big business.

<TEXT> This is a bogus requirement by the state.  This is a strictly faith-based organization designed for the fellowship of bible-believing Christians.  There are few student organizations that specifically cater to the spiritual needs of bible-believing, conservative Christians at a public university.  
I was a former member of InterVarsity Christian fellowship in the 90s.  Even though I am a no longer professing Christian, I still think this is a bogus requirement because I know what InterVarsity really stands for and this CSU bureaucrats have no clue what the organization's real purpose.  And it has nothing to do with politics.

Bible believing Christians are often a tiny minority on campus and often need to find place to make friends and fellowship.  I was in similar circumstances in 1996 when I attended Cal State Fullerton because I had few friends.  InterVarsity provided me place to find friends and make friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How many days in jail that he actually spends.  Let me bet that actually means 12 days (120 days * 10% of time served).   He will probably do time in a city jail so he will actually do the sixty days.

In OC, he would do sixty days in jail whether he was in the county jail or a city jail. It is ridiculous that criminals only have to do 10% of their effective jail sentence in jail in LA County jails.  I do believe in early release parole (1/3 of the county jail sentence but you would have to voted by a county board of parole) for sentence over 90 days, but not automatic release for only serving 10% of your sentence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion, people should be waned about the consequences of not finishing their education and the amount of debt that they are placed in.  University of Phoneix are designed for people who schedule's do not permit them to attend the traditional university structure and need to get a degree in accelerated of period of time.

Also, traditional public schools are have impacted programs where it i is difficult for people to get into competitive programs due massive amount of people who want to enroll them. 

These companies are supposed to be for the student who needs a schedule where a traditional university does not meet their needs or the students who is in impacted major and needs to get the degree as quick as possible. Unless a student fits in two these categories and who has been counselled about the cost of the program, a student should not enroll in these classes.

<TEXT> It should be tied to one's cost living in the particular area.  California should have $11.00 minimum wage because most of the state lives in high-cost areas. In Texas, which is lower-cost state, the cost living is much lower so the minimum wage should be $9.00.

The idea of an $15.00 minimum wage is ludicrous.  I think the real problem is that employers are too cheap in giving lower-wage workers cost of living and merit increases for time of service and high quality of performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Based on my experience on the churches,from first-hand accounts of my friends (I am Unitarian Universalist so my selection of churches is a lot more narrower than other people) 

1. Sanctuary- a good biblical church based on 
2. The Crossing
3. First Love
From First-Hand Experience
4. The Effect in San Juan Capistrano
5. Aliso Creek Presbyterian Church
6. Reverance Chruch 

Church Number #5. I went to for five years before turning officially agnostic/atheist
Church Number #6- I never went to this church except for one time but the pastor is an excellent teacher of scripture.

I am UU because I have issues with Christianity based on science and historical facts but not theology (I am moderate conservative Reformed Christian with progressive political/social leanings if I am a believer.).  The UU church fits my current belief system better than a Christian church so that is why I am a UU and not a Christian.

<TEXT> There needs to be a serious rewrite of rules regarding the application of use of force by police officers.  Any unauthorized use of force beyond that the proper rules of engagement can result in felony prosecution.  Once you get start jailing cops on mass for excessive force, than you will see these type of incidents.

If I were a prosecutor, I would have zero tolerance for this behavior especially if there is no real or perceived threat engaged by the officer.  The officer should be charged with misdemeanor assault.  He should not lose his job, but he will have a misdemeanor on his record for assault. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my job market, I am beginning to partially "give up" my job search.  There is enough work at my local Labor Ready to get at least 32-40 hours a work.  Yes, it is grunt work, but at least there is work.

Most of the problem with people "giving up" exist in small labor markets with limited job opportunities in very limited jobs.  There is only so many grunt jobs/minimum wage jobs to go around.

The flaw in the Republican thinking about not extending benefits is to understand the job markets where there is abundance of low-wage jobs that are easy to get and job markets where there is limited low-wage jobs and there is huge competition for those jobs.

The other issue is that most one-stops center job counselors lack the proper training to teach job-searchers proper job search strategy.  Most of people need to taught how to network outside their comfort zone and how to develop large contacts of people.  The one-stop center really lack the in-depth training to use these resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is incredibly stupid idea in California because people drive ridiculous commutes just to work for a job.  Not everybody has the ability to pick up where they live and relocate within five miles of their job.

I can do that especially in an area of abundance of recovery homes until I find a room to rent.  Not everybody can relocate very quickly and very fast.  And a lot of people do not want to move away from their families and friends just to live near where they work just to avoid to paying a tax. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People that habitual drunk driving laws should be subject to felony convictions if they commit at least four drunk driving charges in ten years.  Once they get more than four DUIs in ten year, each subsequent DUI is a felony.  Eventually, the subject offenders will get nailed by the habitual offender laws in their states and will face stiff jail time (like 15+ years in jail for DUI).  If a person commits habitual DUIs over a long period of time, but does not commit four in a ten year window, should not subject to be a felony law. </TEXT>

The people who live in rural areas have to most lose if the post office get privatized because the corporations will significantly increase the price of rural deliveries.  And I read somewhere that UPS and Fed Ex rely on the postal service to deliver in some remote rural areas because it is out of UPS and Fed-Ex's area of service.  </TEXT>

I think people have switched to watching videos online as part of Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Bitorrent (which is illegal).  Also, people use DVRs now and watch TV at later dates.

I can totally understanding when it comes to abortion when abortion is considered to be "abortion of convenience" and there is real no health justification for it.  I am beginning to oppose abortion in all cases where it is considered to be a "abortion of convenience" instead of health reasons or the women has drastic circumstances that make her to get an abortion. I am pro-choice but only for health cases or the mother is dire circumstances where having a child is not considered to be a feasible option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reality is that market does not "self-correct". It takes both investment from both the government and private sector to grow business.  

How is the private sector supposed to "self-correct" a horrendous labor participation rate?  If the market was to "self-correct" the labor participation rate, we would still see significant downward pressure on wages which would lead to greater inequity in the economy.  Greater inequity in the economy eventually leads to reduced consumer spending .  It is all a vicious cycle that will not end until we do something about income inequality.  Until the government changes the tax laws to incentivize companies from stopping hoarding cash, you are not going to see any future investment  </TEXT>

I think one of the major issues that should have been brought up at sentences was whether there was attempts to get her into a treatment program. If the evidence shows that nobody personally intervened to get her into treatment, this would be a major migitation factor. Once an alcoholic has been offered the opportunity to get treatment, the responsibility is on them to get treatment. It is also their job to remain sober. However, untreated alcoholism without the chance of treatment to me is a considered to be a major migitating circumstance on a criminal case </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look I am white guy that has lived or goes through Santa Ana almost every day. I shop at the local Walmart over Harbor and McFadden.  I use to live off Euclid and First and go downtown all the time.

Never once I was threated.  Sure, my phone was stolen when I left it on the bus, however, that would be expected in any major urban portion of the OC where people are struggling.

Personally, I believe that most of the danger is largely dependent on who associate with Santa Ana.  If you associate or family with gang-bangers or drug-users, you should expect your fair share of violence.  However, it is my  experience that there is little violence as long you do not associate with gangbangers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that Obama is getting a lot of pressure from the neo-conservative camp to do something on Syria and he wants to follow Clinton's footsteps in terms of limited intervention in foreign entanglements where whole-scale massacres of innocent people.  However, the Iraq War has permanently discredited the US use of force in foreign entanglements even the if the use of force was limited.  If Obama wanted to truly intervene the proper way, he should have gave arms to rebels a long time ago and sent special forces as advisors for training the rebels. I think that is better use of military resources than limited strikes that could potential escalate the war. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are plenty ways to learn how to hustle.  You just have to have the willingness to do so.

Hustling in this case means hustlings to get a job in your profession which means you try to sell yourself to other people within your profession even if it is technical field.

I do not hustle for jobs because I am a little bit fearful, too hesistant and I got to deal with my recovery as well.  In addition, I have to rely on the bus system (which is fairly reliable where I live, but takes a long time to get around on).  I am starting to realize that I have to hustle for a job, but I have to break my fear and willin </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I knew people who in my social network who spew anti-Obama stuff, but I personally are wonderful and very nice people.  A lot of Christians that I know are very spiritual and really love God with all of their hearts.

I think that the media poisons the debate and makes charactures out of both liberals and conservatives.  Unless you know people personally really well that hold those views, sometimes the sterotype persists especially when you spend all of our time hanging out with one type of people.

People follow the echo chamber so much (including myself) and do not realize that reality is far different than the echo chamber that exists on the left.  Not all of right-wing and left-wing talk hosts reflect the craziness.  There is a lot of thoughtful conservative talk radio hosts (like Michael Medev) or Thom Hartmann who is a liberal talk show host.  I think Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes are very thoughful people as well. 

Not everybody that you hear on the radio is bombastic, but the people are the bombastic tend to drive the highest ratings and advertising dollars.  The funny is that the most crazy guy on the left, Mike Malloy, gets rejected even though Mike Malloy is often right.

<TEXT> The only problem with that theory is that the wealthy are not receiving additional benefits for money paid into the system.  Unlike the income taxes which were designed to be a progressive system, the social security tax is designed to be social insurance program which is based on how much a person's contributes to the program over a period of time and the benefit is proportional to the tax receipts that paid into the system. 

Once the tax has no ceiling on income, it ceases to be a social insurance tax, but rather a form of restricted income tax on the wealthy disguised as a social insurance tax where the tax receipts are creates an encumbrance (restriction) on expenditures to be used to shore up security instead of being appropriated for use in the government general fund. 

In conclusion, raising the ceiling is a form of restricted income tax on the wealthy and is not designed to social insurance for their income.

<TEXT> Obama has a "fear" of not looking being bi-partisan and just being bold liberal who fights for liberal causes.  He wants to be seen as 
"post-partisan" and is afraid of being tagged as a liberal in his legacy.  Instead, he should embrace the liberal agenda and be like President Johnson who liberal agenda defines him to this day. While Johnson always have the Vietnam War that will tarnish his agenda, Obama should have realized that liberalism will have defined his legacy, and not trying to be post-partisan with this group of Republicans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thinking that voting is somehow a entitlement is an purely indirect method of hiding one's own view of racial superiority. It suggets that one has an inferior view of poor and uneducated black people having the right to vote.  Do we give white and poor voters and deny them the right to vote? The answer is no.  

The South has infamous documented history of making voting access difficult to racial minorities and other lower-class people.  Therefore, letting the South monitior its own election is liking letting Wall Street police itself.  We know that self-regulation in the end does not exist in places where the environment itself encourages noncomplaince with federal constitutional law.  Therefore, we need to keep the voting protection acts as long as possible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the main problem is that he used doomsday language to get the Republicans to sway to vote on more tax increases.  That is not simply possible.  You are going to have to elect more dems because you have to tell and demonstrate the these cuts are actually bad for the economy and you need more revenue to do it.  We actually need to experience a few months of the sequester to really to determine whether it is really harmful for the country.  If it is, than the Republicans lose the political battle and Obama will be proven right.  If not, the GOP will have some talking points for the 2014 campaign. </TEXT>

People will see that the Republicans are right on spending cuts that the effects of the sequester are overstated (even I though I favor less spending cuts and higher taxes).  Remember, that 50% of the cuts are coming from defense which is something that we need to cut anyways and the GOP (except for some like Rand and Ron Paul) would refuse to cut it prior to the sequester </TEXT>

There are infinite amount of stars and possibliy a large amount of intelligent life out there that we cannot detect.  We do not know how God has dealt with them.

<TEXT> Why is Obama on this issue?  He should be like Theodore Roosevelt and makes this merger DOA.  Nothing

All Obama has to state that he opposes the merger and that he instruct the FTC to block the merger.  The corporations will then back down and not merge.

Of course, Obama captiluates on everything and therefore, does not have capablity to stop large corporations because he fears them too much. </TEXT>

People that listen to conservative get half-truths most of the time.  At times, Beck and his ilk are partially right, but they distort the rest of the story which creates a half-truth.

Our voters rely on half-truth equate it with truth and therefore, will vote Republicans because of their inablity to listen to diverse news sources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He should have the golden light and quit.  Heroin is serious drug that should not be messed with.

My friends use drugs, but they stay away from heroin, crack, and meth.  Most of them are not addicts and use drugs safely.  Those drugs can kill and rob lives.

Which was a more prosperous time in this country, but a time where intolerance and social conservatism were far more widespread than today.  And, yes being an atheist was far more frowned on than it is today. </TEXT>
