 How to compose a successful critical commentary:

 You should attempt to re-express your targets position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, Thanks, I wish Id thought of putting it that way.

 You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).

 You should mention anything you have learned from your target.

 Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday I thought the OP and many commenters had said everything that needed to be said, but then my half-asleep musings in the night brought up some more.

He needs to know how important humor is, both in relationships generally and in sex specifically.  In both cases there will be little awkward moments and laughing is the best way to get trhough them.

Talking openly is really key to both relationships and sex.  Being able to say "I've never done this before' or 'I'm pretty nervous, let's slow down and talk for a while' will stand him in good stead.  Also 'I really like it when you move that way' and 'Would this be even better if I were a little slower?'

Without getting too technical and jargony, an acquaintance with the stages of arousal,  la Masters and Johnson, would be useful.

He needs to know that women are for the most part more varied in their sexual response than men.  Many don't orgasm from PIV sex alone and it's unlikely with a girl during her first time.  In fact, he would do well to see that she orgasms first and waits to enter until she invites him in.  Frank talk would help here, telling her that that's what he wants, that they have plenty of time, that they can wait for another time.  You could watch some movies with him with those scenes of ripping off clothes, falling into bed and having stupendous simultaneous orgasms, and let him know how unrealistic they are.  

You're doing a great job and I hope his first time is wonderful for them both. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other quotes from the 'conversation':

*  When you write you should pretend that you, the writer, see something in the world that's interesting, that you are directing the attention of your reader to that thing in the world, and that you are doing so by means of conversation. 

*  The controversy between "prescriptivists" and "descriptivists" is like the choice in "America: Love it or leave it" or "Nature versus Nurture"--a euphonious dichotomy that prevents you from thinking.

*  Overcoming the curse of knowledge may be the single most important requirement in becoming a clear writer. 

*  You've got to show people a draft. Even if you're writing for laypeople, your reviewers don't all have to be laypeople; a colleague is better than no one. I'm often astonished at things that I think are obvious that turn out to be not so obvious to other people.

<TITLE> Criteria for switching from the present tense to a past tense </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-17 17:59:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have an intuition that languages differ in their criteria for switching from the present tense to a past tense.  For example, when does 'I like this restaurant' shift to 'I liked that restaurant'?  Just before leaving, just ourside the door, after arriving home?  

Not knowing how to characterize this so as to research it, I keep running into prescriptive advice not to employ tense shifting, along with explanations of the various uses of tenses.  

My notion is that English is quicker to switch to a past tense than many other languages, such as possibly German, Spanish or Japanese.  How do I go about investigating this on the internet? </TEXT>

51.4 percent of conservative Republicans think we're spending too little on either Social Security, health care or both. Only 28.7 percent think we're spending too much, and just 7.3 percent think we're spending too much on both.

That's 7.3 percent of conservative Republicans in support of the position taken by leaders of both political parties.

<TEXT> What are the origins of the misuse of the -eez plurals other than pretension?  Once they become widespread people simply copy them, but what gets them started?  

The reason I blame pretension is probably because I first heard these -eez plurals thrown around when I started college.  Plurals of thesis, basis and the like were in frequent use and it seemed many students were consciously trying to get them right. 

And maybe the reason some words are immune, such as recess, is that there's no status gain to be had.  Or have you ever heard ree-sehs-eez? </TEXT>

As you stand in the gap between reality and possibility, the temptation is to jump onto one side or the other. If you jump onto the side of too much hard reality, you can get stuck in corrosive cynicism. If you jump onto the side of too much possibility, you can get caught up in irrelevant idealism. These two extremes sound very different, but they have the same impact on us: both take us out of the gap  and the gap is where all the action is.

The Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, NA](http://www.americablog.com/2012/07/list-of-libor-banks-involved-in-setting.html)

<TEXT> From the article:

If we think of the tax code as a set of incentives, rather than simply a mechanism to redistribute income, there are creative and effective ways to moderate the extremes of wealth, boost the pay of ordinary workers, make American companies more stable and efficient, and reduce the long-term federal budget deficit.

An astonishing contributor to inequality, then, is corporate bosses taking a larger share of the companys revenue for themselves.

Because current CEO pay numbers are so far out of the ordinary, its hard to argue that they are a natural outcome of the market.

Its difficult to estimate what combination of approaches will prevail, but whatever happens, it will be bring broad benefits to society as a whole, far outweighing the impact on the federal budget. </TEXT>

And look into a flip-twist (articulated) LCD screen.  They are great for raising the camera over your head to see over crowds, for flowers and stuff close to the ground if you're into that, and especially for candid photos where people don't know you're photographing them -- people pay more attention to where you're looking than where the lens is pointing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We cannot help but be a society of strangers, yet underneath this, we cannot be a society at all unless we recognize our mutual obligations to one another. It is possible that our rude ancestors had it right all along: that obligations are more important than debts, and that amnesties are the key to economic and social order. Surely this question faces us now with a force that cannot be ignored. We are truly in each others debt, but it is a debt that extends beyond the mere payment of the sum of money.

I grew up in and have lived in several regions and countries so maybe getting used to 'funny' ways of talking is easier for me.  The differences are fascinating though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure.  That line was taken directly from the article.  This says it better but is too long for a headline:

 Malone and Woolley didnt find that women per se were the key to a good C factor. Its just that social sensitivity, which was overwhelmingly the leading ingredient in high C factor, was overly correlated to women. In fact, when they controlled for the number of women in a group, it was shown that it was the emotional sensitivity scores which won out. So adding a woman to a team no more guarantees higher success rates than adding an Aaron to your dance party will make it a success.

Even asked about getting a future appointment moved up and they said come in tomorrow around 10am.  I showed up at 8:30 and was quickly registered.  Sure I waited for the procedure but I got out of there about 2pm after a CT scan and was happy with the whole procedure.

<TEXT> These pieces are all worth reading but I found the one by Roger Schank especially compelling: 

To learn to predict well, one needs to be educated about how to predict and one needs to make predictions and to examine what went wrong when those predictions fail. Curiously the schools teach none of this.

The idea that kids can make predictions is not a really radical point. My point is that prediction has to be the curriculum and not be ancillary to the curriculum.

<TEXT> There are some issues that cross political boundaries -- accountability, transparency and oversight.  Even moderate Republicans can support some version of these.  The devil is in the details though, so they can be twisted into their evil twins -- bureaucracy, loss of control, nanny-state regulations.

We need to use framing and repetition to promote our version of those issues.  The right wing has mastered framing and repetition.  We should take a note from their play book. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The real Dominant Paradigm -- the one held by the overwhelming majority of people on the planet -- is more decentralized and amorphous, yet is grounded in shared values that merit enunciation. These include: a belief in the virtues of community; a desire to be part of something greater than oneself; a reciprocal relationship with nature and life's essential resources; an aversion to open hostilities and devastating warfare; an interest in the wellbeing of others as a precondition of personal prosperity; an adherence to culturally-transcendent principles such as the Golden Rule; and a willingness to work hard in return for an equitable existence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.	On the first legislative day of a new Congress, the Senate may, by majority vote, end a filibuster on a rules change and adopt new rules.

2.	There should only be one opportunity to filibuster any given measure or nomination, so motions to proceed and motions to refer to conference should not be subject to filibuster.

3.	Secret "holds" should be eliminated.

4.	The amount of delay time after cloture is invoked on a bill should be reduced.

5.	There should be no post-cloture debate on nominations.

6.	Instead of requiring that those seeking to break a filibuster muster a specified number of votes, the burden should be shifted to require those filibustering to produce a specified number of votes to continue the filibuster.

7.	Those waging a filibuster should be required to continuously hold the floor and debate.

8.	Once all Senators have had a reasonable opportunity to express their views, every measure or nomination should be brought to a yes or no vote in a timely manner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some cities are using alternative voting, usually some instant runoff system.  I'm hopeful that successes at lower levels could spread upwards.

Some years ago I read/heard an interview with a guy, I think Kalle Lasn of Adbusters, who had worked with anti-tobacco advertising that was successful in reducing the incidence of young people taking up smoking.  You may remember the ads with a cigarette that looked glamorous until it drooped in a display of impotence.  He wanted to do similar things with social issues but was prevented by the media's ability to deny advocacy advertising.  When the interviewer pointed out that even if he were allowed to create such ads, the money backing them would be a pittance against what the monied powers could amass.  Kalle (or whoever) replied that they didn't need to blanket the airways -- with just a foot in the door they could do serious damage to the conventional wisdom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm nave enough to think there are some cross-partisan issues that promise a broad appeal.  **Transparency, accountability, oversight.**  I realize the far right doesn't like these but they line up with notions we learned in Civics class about how democracy is supposed to work.  

Voting reform is important and would increase the percentage of voters if they thought their vote made a difference.  [Range Voting](http://rangevoting.org/) has impressed me the best but almost any alternative to winner-take-all would be an improvement.

Changing the ability of media to deny advocacy advertising would open a wedge for some creative [culture jamming](http://www.adbusters.org/).

There would be plenty of opposition to these kinds of issues but at least they ought not to splinter any movement of ours internally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About some doctors in the Nazi death camps:

They would do what they could to help, except for the most important thing of all, which is they wouldnt question the existence of the entire death camp itself. So they would find themselves working within the rules, however they could, to try to improve conditions marginally. And in retrospect, of course, thats just not sufficient. And as a longtime activist, I see myself and other activists doing the same thing, that what we do is we do everything that is allowed by those in power to attempt to stop their destruction. But the problem is, whenever we figure out a way to use their rules to actually stop them, they change the rules.

Now they are using their political power and control over the media to attack Social Security. 

This effort is being led by billionaire investment banker Peter Peterson. Mr. Peterson has personally profited to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from the "fund managers' tax subsidy," an obscure provision of the tax code that allows billionaires to pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers and firefighters. However, Peterson believes in giving back. He has committed $1 billion to an effort that is intended to take away the Social Security benefits that people have worked and paid for.

<TEXT> The Republicans have done their best to make this election about fear and hate. That is their brand of sand.

Democrats are cooperating nicely, by refusing to engage in a values debate.

The only question is, why?

For many people the answer is simple: voters don't really have a choice; the political process is nothing more than a Kabuki dance in which both sides represent corporate America and the uber-rich, while playing their respective roles in public.

That answer is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Believing it makes it so.

But even if it's true, we, the people are the only power capable of changing that reality. We can start by refusing to drink the sand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, what a lot of great advice here.  Follow even half of it and you'll be in good shape.

About starting young:  I once heard a comparison between someone who saves a fixed amount over a period of 30 years from the age of 35 until 65 vs someone who saves the same amount over an 11-year period from 19 to 35, and then keeps the money in investments.  At age 65 the early saver has about **twice** the amount as the late starter.

The distinction between needs and wants is critical.  Keep a list and when you see something you want, make it a point not to buy it right away but add it to the list and review and prioritize the whole list before buying anything big.  Make sure the list includes all the responsible stuff such as the 6-month or 12-month emergency fund.

When you're in a store being tempted by some shiny toy, take of picture of it.  You'll find an even more tempting toy soon -- take a picture of that too.  Soon you'll have a photo collection of ephemeral wants that will make you smile embarrassedly like reading your diary from third grade.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After decades of hyper-militant consumerism and its attending alienation, and a national consciousness spun from pure capitalist bullshit and mirrors, it is testimony to the American people that they can still see to piss straight, much less recognize any sort of truth whatsoever. Yet, a portion of Americans are beginning to grasp the truth about what has happened to their country -- that it has been bought and paid for by an elite class in a nation that is supposed to be classless. </TEXT>

It controls our education or lack of education, and it controls the price, quantity and quality of the food we eat. It controls the quality of the air we breathe, and soon, through pollution credits, even the price they will pay for that air. Most importantly, it holds concentrated legal and governmental authority, not to mention the machinery of both parties to grant itself more authority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If war were undisguisedly as nasty and brutish as it truly is, it might also tend to be short.  Soldiers freed from illusions might mutiny, as many did in Vietnam, or desert and go home.  But this modern, cushier kind of pseudo-war is different.  


The odd thing is that no one seems to question the relative cushiness of this life at war (nor the inequity of the hardscrabble civilian life left behind) -- least of all those best able to observe firsthand the contrast between our garrisons and the humble equipment and living conditions of Afghans, both friend and foe.  Rather, the contrast seems to inspire many soldiers with renewed appreciation of "our American way of life" and a determination to "do good things" for the Afghan people, just as many feel they did for the people of Iraq.  


Most infantry missions are "presence patrols," described by one officer as "walking around in places where we won't get shot at just to show the Afs [Afghans] that we're keeping them safe."  


In a typical mess-up on the actual terrain of Afghanistan, Army experts previously in charge of this base had already had a million-dollar suspension bridge built over a river some distance away, but hadn't thought to secure land rights, so no road leads to it.  Now the local American agriculture specialist wants to introduce alfalfa to these waterless, rocky mountains to feed herds of cattle principally pastured in his mind. </TEXT>

One clue to this: When a problem arises, we fight back with more of the same, except in higher - more lethal - doses.

The fourth is that he fundamentally does not understand the powers and the role of the modern presidency.  And the fifth is that he maintains the worst communications apparatus in the White House since Jimmy Carter prowled its corridors.  In fairness to his communications team, though, he has given them almost nothing to sell.  You try singing the praises of bailing out Goldman Sachs one hundred cents on the dollar, or of a health care plan that forces people to buy plans they don't want from hated insurance vultures.  It ain't easy, pal.  Yet, on the other hand, Bush and Cheney had far less than nothing to sell when it came to the Iraq war - indeed, they had nothing but lies - and their team handled that masterfully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tangentially related -- my daughter diaper-trained herself at about 2 when we were staying at a beach in Africa where everyone peed and pooped in the sand dunes.  She went naked most of the time but the important thing was being with adults, both male and female, and watching their process, including burying the poop.

Took the mystery out of it for her anyway and gave her something to imitate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> from the article:
Ninety-five percent of criminologists study blue collar crime.

Five percent study white collar crime.

Of the tiny minority who study white collar crime, ninety five percent focus on the individuals who rip off the corporation.

We are left with a small handful of criminologists  think Edwin Sutherland, John Braithwaite, Gil Geis  who have studied or are studying  corporate crime.

That would be crime by the corporation.

Bill Black is one of the most prominent of those living corporate criminologists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another single-Xer here, moved to respond by the flurry of thoughts and feelings triggered by your post and all the comments. 

There is something of value in all the comments and I'm heartened by all the good advice.  The basic issues seem to me to be related to how to be in the world, and they apply to all of us, of whatever age or gender.  I don't mean to denigrate the advice about makeup and clothes -- it's good advice and may be more accessible than 'deeper' issues.  

Even though you don't want to move in with your dad, I hope you can find a way to use your relationship with him as a source of strength.  And I suggest that it's helpful to remember that however misguided your mother is, she loves you and mostly intends what she says to be for what she thinks is good for you.  And you can love her back, this deeply flawed woman, without succumbing to her warped views.

Make no mistake, though, Qeraeth is right in characterizing this as emotional abuse.  Not many of us grew up without some abuse, but still I think it's better to call it what it is.  The thing to do is to use that knowledge to free yourself from the entanglements.  Detachment doesn't mean separation, just kind of getting unhooked (huge work at your age, but you're up to it).

Stay tight with friends who understand and support you without a lot of judgement.  You don't need to push the others away unless they're really toxic, just don't tune yourself to their opinions.

This sub-reddit looks like it could be a valuable resource for you.  Use what works and don't let the rest slow you down.  Bless you.

<TEXT> It seems to me the best chance for effectiveness would come from supporting issues a broad spectrum could agree on, not something that would divide for leftists from libertarians, free marketeers from social democrats.  

There are a number of voting reform issues -- some kind of [preference voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_voting);  insuring the [integrity of the vote](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/); providing for expanded but verified registration; insuring that waiting lines for voting are reduced and are not skewed by voting district.

To the extent that we can call for accountability, transparency and oversight without having the arguments devolve into anti-regulatory rhetoric, those are overarching concerns that deserve wide support.  They also importantly allow for a correctable result instead of fixing even a good policy into place that later has unintended consequences.

A couple of personal favorites of mine are the abolition of corporate personhood, and opening media advertising to include issue advocacy so that the networks couldn't deny Adbusters, for example, the right to buy air time.  Those causes may have narrower support though.  </TEXT>

These are the problems at the foundation of our health-care system, resulting in a slow rot and requiring more and more money just to keep the system from collapsing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keeping prices opaque is one way medical institutions seek to avoid competition and thereby keep prices up. Without transparency on prices-and the related data on measurable outcomes-efforts to give the consumer more control over health care have failed, and always will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Imagine confiscating all the profits of all the famously greedy health-insurance companies. That would pay for 4 days of health care for all Americans. Lets add in the profits of the 10 biggest rapacious U.S. drug companies. Another 7 days. Indeed, confiscating all the profits of all American companies, in every industry, wouldnt cover even five months of our health-care expenses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For almost all our health-care needs, the current system allows us as consumers to ask providers, Whats my share? instead of How much does this cost?-a question we ask before buying any other good or service. And the subtle difference between those two questions is costing us all a fortune. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Accidentally, but relentlessly, America has built a health-care system with incentives that inexorably generate terrible and perverse results. Incentives that emphasize health care over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing. And thatmost importantremove consumers from our irreplaceable role as the ultimate ensurer of value. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Resources on aging seem to be mostly about slowing, resisting, preventing, delaying or diminishing.  Where are some resources that deal with *preparing* for dimished capacity?  Examples:

*  Dealing with no longer being able to live in your own home
*  Accepting help with tasks you used to do yourself
*  Allowing health care 'strangers' to assist you with intimate functions
*  Learning to accept that others'judgements may be more competant than your own
*  Surrendering control over financial, legal or other important decisions, rather than having control wrested from you

Those of you more familiar with these issues than I can add many others.

[The Myth of Alzheimer's](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Alzheimers-Todays-Dreaded-Diagnosis/dp/031236816X) has a great deal of very useful information and insight.  

Are there training materials that can be given to aging people, while they're still alert and independent, that will help them prepare for changes in their alertness and independence?

<TEXT> From William Gibson's [Pattern Recognition (2003)] (http://www.scribd.com/doc/10073557/William-Gibson-Pattern-Recognition-2003):
If there's any one thing about England that Cayce finds fundamentally disturbing, it is how "class" works--a word with a very different mirror-world meaning, somehow. She's long since given up trying to explain this to English friends.

The closest she can come is that it's somewhat akin, for her, if only in its enormity, to how the British seem to feel about certain American attitudes to firearms ownership which they generally find unthinkable, and bafflingly self-evidently wrong, and so often leading to a terrible and profligate waste of human life. And she knows what they mean, but also knows how deeply it runs, the gun thing, and how unlikely it is to change.  Except, perhaps, gradually, and over a very long time. Class in England is like that, for her.

I find this provocative.  Does it resonate? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently read a href="http://www.economicgangsters.com/" rel="nofollow"Economic Gangsters: Corruption, Violence, and the Poverty of Nations/a.  It fit well with my interests but I was especially impressed by the authors' emphasis on research and the analysis of data rather than ideology.  Their advocacy for randomized trials looks fruitful where they are even possible.  

How is a layman with no economic training supposed to judge among economic explanations and prescriptions?  Either FDR exacerbated the Depression with his policies or he ameliorated it, but where is the objective basis for which side to choose?  Keynes and von Mises may both be wrong, but both can't be right.  

Sometimes I'm able to criticize the premises of an economic argument or definition.  For example, excluding 'women's work' from GDP calculations seems flawed from the start.  But often I am too easily influenced by the most recent argument I encounter, without anything but my gut to help me.

Most economic reasoning looks to me like its coming from different sides of the elephant, with little hope of agreement.  Is this all there is?

Surely there must be a better way.   </TEXT>
