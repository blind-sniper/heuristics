(The pen-pin merger just means that when I say a word that has a "short e" before a nasal - that is, n or m - I turn it into a "short i", so that the word pen and the word pin sound exactly alike to me. This isn't universal in American English, and is more common Down South and among African-Americans, iirc.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose it depends on what sort of food you like to cook. 

If you mostly like Italian style cooking, I'd go with fennel, oregano, "italian seasoning", garlic powder (if for some reason you don't want to do fresh garlic) or rosemary, paprika.

If you mostly like "American, non-regional" style cooking, I'd go with nutmeg, cinnamon, paprika, cumin (or thyme, I forgot thyme is a thing), and bay leaves (or oregano).

If you mostly like Indian style cooking, then I'd go with coriander, cardamon, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cumin.

If you mostly like Tex-mex, then I'd go with cumin, paprika, smoked paprika (because smoked paprika is delicious), oregano, and something else.

You see the problem here? My top five varies depending on what sort of foods I plan to cook. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True. Often, different populations will define the same word differently. However, that doesn't mean that either population is *wrong*. It just means that they are different, and perhaps that there will be some confusion between those two populations.

When you know what another person means, and they are using a widely accepted definition of a word, it is thus incorrect to tell them they are wrong.

Merriam-Webster, for the record, lists both definitions:

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/factoid

The "untrue fact" definition comes first, however, that doesn't mean that it is used by more people. Merriam-Webster traditionally puts the older definitions first, whether or not they are the most common. I believe they are in the process of changing this, but they haven't gotten to every entry yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How are you wrong? Let me count the ways.

1. Christians didn't "adapt" anything... and there are a heck of a lot of Christians who *do* take the Bible very literally. (Except when they don't. I know people who believe that the miracle at Cana was turning water into grape juice.)

2. Muslim society in the 11th century was far in advance of Christian society.

3. Muslims today are not generally "stuck in the 11th century".

4. Like Christians, Muslims hold a wide range of opinions and views. Just like we don't assume all Christians are like Fred Phelps, we shouldn't assume all Muslims are like bin Ladin.

5. Syrians do not universally hate the West, and it is doubtful they hate Uruguay specifically.

6. It is worth mentioning, again, that a good number of Syrian refugees *are not Muslim*.

7. It is not impossible to learn a new language.

8. You know darn well that if YOU were in THEIR shoes, you'd run to any country willing to take you and be grateful. Well, maybe you wouldn't be grateful, but I'm pretty sure they will be. Helping the poor is what we're supposed to do as a civilized society.

This list is incomplete. I ran out of energy, but you didn't run out of errors. Your comment is, indeed, fractally wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Putting aside the fact that a good number of Syrian refugees *aren't Muslim* (seriously, how you've missed hearing about the Yazidis and the Druze, I don't know), not all Muslims take the Quran equally literally. You might as well say that Uruguay should expel its Christians because "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise" is in the Bible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anti-abortion groups have been targeting Roe v Wade protections ever since, trying to find the argument that can bring it down.

Nothing is ever "settled". Look at Plessy v Ferguson. That was "settled" law for decades, but dedicated work brought it down smashingly in the middle of the last century.

(Now, I'm against Plessy but for Roe. I don't want you to think, by my citing both, that I look favorably on the work of those who campaign against abortion, nor that I think the civil rights movement was bad. I simply couldn't think of another example.) </TEXT>

New edit: Of course I'll cite it.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/08/daily-show-homelessness_n_6437644.html

Now, Salt Lake City has a population just under 200,000. And they have just about 2,000 homeless people (which counts those who are now housed by this initiative, as near as I can tell). Which means that about 1% of the population is homeless. Somebody ran the numbers upthread, and in NYC we have slightly less homelessness per capita, at .7% of the population. </TEXT>

With little alternative, of course they do. You might as well say that the victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire *chose* to work under *those* conditions, for *that* pay.

Forcing our views upon the people of Myanmar risks the livelihood of all of the lower paid workers there.

Not if we require all business that operate in our countries to pay a universal minimum wage wherever they set up shop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, up until CoS, they always had at least one child home. And as she was homeschooled, they were doing it on one income - I don't think Molly would accept it if Bill and Charlie sent money home, do you?

Second, Arthur isn't paid very well.

Third, my guess is they're simply *bad with money*. Arthur spends it on old Muggle junk. Molly buys Lockhart books like they're going out of style.

(And fourth, I personally think Molly is a big ol' narcissist. I am NOT a fan of the Weasley parents. Some people thrive on playing "oh, poor me", and enforced poverty seems right up Molly's alley. So they could actually be doing quite well, and she could be exaggerating their poverty because that makes her feel better. It's sick, but some people do stuff like that.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How often women with children regret having children.

Do you know, I actually know multiple people whose parents have told them one of the following:

1. They regret having children.
2. They regret having had children when they did, and if they could do it all over again they'd abort the first child(ren) and only have the later one(s).
3. They regret having as many children as they did, and if they could do it all over again they'd abort the last child(ren) and only have the first one(s).

These parents weren't all abusive assholes either, who might be expected to say *anything*. Some of them, as near as I can tell, are good parents... who, in retrospect, realize they screwed up and really regret their reproductive choices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then you'll grow out of it in a short time. Sometimes children do go through phases, yes. It doesn't harm them to go along with it, though.

Puberty blockers are started at the age of puberty, or during precocious puberty. A ten or twelve year old is probably no longer going through silly phases where they would like to be a "butterfly" when grown. If they've been saying for years that they are really a girl (or boy), they probably know whereof they speak.

In between birth and puberty, if your child-with-a-penis wants to wear a dress, it doesn't harm that child to let them do it. And if your child-with-a-vagina wants to be called "Tom", again, it doesn't harm them to just go along with this. If it's a phase, they'll ask you to stop sooner or later. If it's not, they won't. Either way, they'll remember their childhood as being filled with love and acceptance.

Children never, ever, ever forget how you made them feel. </TEXT>

They do know what gender they are. It's the other people around them who sometimes don't.

 I don't think it's unreasonable to hold off on labeling a kid that young.

Nobody minds labeling babies as girls or boys, and we've found that when children say they're a girl or boy, they usually don't change their minds at adulthood.

See, this isn't something where we need to debate it out. We already have the facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There aren't terribly many out transgender individuals in the world to date, so it's normal for people not to understand. 

What I have found, through the advantage of being a few years older than you :) and also through happening to fall into the neurodiversity movement as a young woman is that it doesn't really matter if I understand another person's self-identification or not. All I have to grasp is that it is important to *them*, however strange it might seem to me. If I start with that attitude, I usually come to understand whatever-it-is over time, and without the stress. (I also ended up gathering a rather diverse set of friends this way. So much more interesting than only having friends who are like me!)

But if you're interested in the subject, googling "transgender 101" will get you a variety of links on the subject. Some are a little more adamant (http://www.tranarchism.com/2010/11/26/not-your-moms-trans-101/) and some are a little more easy-going (http://www.transpeoplespeak.org/trans-101/).  </TEXT>

ALL preschoolers who are developing normally understand what gender they are. Sometimes other people don't understand *them*, but this is normal behavior for children.

And some of those kids will attempt to self-mutilate to get their bodies to look like they want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, there is "such a thing as a transgender girl". Most children know whether they are boys or girls in preschool, hence, most transgender children know they are boys or girls in preschool - whether or not other people think their genitals match. 

And it can be frightening. It's not uncommon to hear of transgender girls trying to cut off their penises, for example.

Yes, this is possible without "significant environmental factors". This happens in accepting families where a child who says they are a boy (or girl) is allowed to use their chosen name and wear clothes of that gender, and this happens in non-accepting families where those children are told they're sinful and wrong.

Gender identity has no connection to sexual orientation. It has nothing to do with "being gay". Your sexual orientation is who you want to sleep with or date. Your gender identity is who you are. Your sex is (roughly) what's between your legs. </TEXT>

And no, one does not perform surgery or give hormone treatment to minors. At most, minors use hormone blockers between puberty and adulthood. If they go off the hormone blockers - a drug we've used safely for years to treat precocious puberty - they simply enter puberty as normal.  </TEXT>

You're right. Telling a child who insists she is a girl that she is REALLY a boy just because of how her body looks IS psychologically dangerous. Children whose self-identification is not accepted run a high risk of depression, self-harm, and even suicide - even when they're quite young.

This is not my ignorant supposition. That's why the accepted treatment for gender dysphoria is transition, because transition is the treatment associated with a reduction in depression, self-harm, and suicide. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If it were genetics then we would see identical twins undergoing the same experience with gender dysphoria. 

Not necessarily. For example, we know that schizophrenia is highly heritable, but having an identical twin with schizophrenia only gives you a 50% chance of developing it yourself.

Additionally, many conditions are congenital that are not genetic in nature. We know that fraternal twins where one is female-bodied and one is male-bodied are more likely to have at least one twin be transgender than singletons, probably due to hormones in utero. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Young children are NOT put on hormones. However, many are put on hormone blockers - a treatment which has been used for decades in treating early puberty, and which is accepted as safe - until majority. At that time, if they change their mind, they can simply go off the blockers and puberty will begin as normal.

Alternatively, they can start hormones as adults, and the transition will  be easier and their appearance will more correctly look like other men/women because they won't have gone through the "wrong" puberty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're not too young. ALL children develop their gender identity in preschool.

If a child with a penis is not "too young" to determine that they are a boy, and a child with a vulva is not "too young" to determine that they are a girl, then the converse is true as well.

"I'm willing to bet money less than half would transition after puberty and they would all live happy lives."

You would lose that bet. People who have more education than you have spent years, even decades studying the subject. Lack of acceptance is associated with depression and self-harm - even in small children. </TEXT>

When you were small, before you knew that people's genitals differed, how did you know you were a girl or a boy? You knew you wanted to act like grown ups of your gender, and you wanted to fit in with other children of your gender, and that you didn't want to do things that were associated with the OTHER gender.

That's all. It's the same for transgender children. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And honestly how many transgender kids are there?

Transgender individuals (based on self-reporting) appear to comprise about .5% of the population. If we assume troop sizes of about 10 girls each, and that transgender girls are as likely to join girl scouts as not, then that's 1 in 20 troops having to deal with this.

However, it can actually be dangerous to identify as transgender, and there's a distinct lack of understanding and awareness around this issue. We're reasonably certain that our numbers are lower than reality, because many transgender individuals won't admit it, even on an anonymous survey. (And the situation gets more complicated with children, as their parents have to accept it for the kid to get anywhere with that.) So we don't really know how many transgender kids there are, nor how many might take advantage of this policy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not "ludicrous". Most children know what gender they are in preschool. We only call it strange when what they know doesn't seem to match up with their external genitalia.

Denying a child's stated gender identity carries a real risk of depression and self-harm - even for very young children. And it's much harder to transition as an adult if you've already gone through puberty as the wrong gender. (Puberty blockers are plenty safe. We've used them for decades to treat precocious puberty. All they do is they prevent puberty. If, upon reaching adulthood, the individual decides NOT to take hormones to transition, they simply go off the blockers and enter puberty in the usual way.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America are not affiliated in any way, shape, or form.

The Boy Scouts tends towards the right - hence their ban of gay members until very recently, their ongoing ban of atheists, etc.

The Girl Scouts tends towards the left - they don't care about the religious affiliation (or lack thereof) of their members, they've been fairly LGBT positive for a few decades, and so on.

More liberal families who want their boys in scouting programs go for groups like Campfire USA or Spiral Scouts, however, none of these have anything like the numbers of Boy Scouts so some just hold their nose and join Boy Scouts anyway. And Conservative Christian families who want their girls in scouting programs join American Heritage Girls or Royal Rangers, both of which seem to also have male analogs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your sex is, roughly, what's between your legs.

Your gender is whether you feel like a girl or a boy.

Most children know what gender they are in preschool. And for most children, it matches up neatly - children with a penis and testicles know they are male, children with vulvas and vaginas know they are female. Nobody questions this, until it goes the other way and a child with a penis knows she's a female or a child with a vulva knows he's male. </TEXT>

Call up your parents. Ask them when you started saying you were a girl (or a boy) and saying things like "Girls do this" or "I don't want to wear those, those are for boys (girls)". 

Unless you were highly unusual, this was in preschool.

That's a normal developmental timetable for ALL children.

When you tell children that what they know about themselves is false, you run a high risk of depression and self-harm - even in preschoolers. Whatever you might like to think on the subject, it's not too much for the attitude you espouse to hurt children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes you are. It's a root vegetable, like turnips (another brassica), but less peppery. You can eat it raw in salads, or you can roast it just like you would a potato (or turnip). It's very crunchy, with a mild flavor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mustard is certainly a brassica, along with the above list and also turnips, bok choi, and (more distantly) radishes.

If you see mustard greens in the market, you'll see they're similar to turnip greens and kale. And if you ever plant cabbage or cauliflower, you'll see the seeds are very similar to mustard seeds. 

Wikipedia is the one in error if they don't list mustard as a member of the brassica family. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I don't like Neelix and Kes together  it works on paper, but they have absolutely no chemistry together.

You know, if they'd settled that issue properly, that would have made sense. Neelix and Kes hooked up because of the whole way they met and how she got rescued. This is not such an uncommon story, and oftentimes couples that start this way find out later that they're not suited for each other. 

But they never resolved it properly, which means that instead of a proper story we have... a couple with no chemistry and you don't know why they stay together. </TEXT>

Yes, it is. There's no reason they couldn't have fobbed some of that off on Harry, given him something to do besides lack any form of growth. Harry could've been the more or less competent medic, and we could have seen that all those Holodeck programs were the combined efforts of Harry and Tom together rather than Tom being a good writer and a decent programmer as well.

That's two complaints with one fix. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The good episodes could be really good, and there weren't too many cringe-worthy clunkers.

Unfortunately, most episodes were just... eh. They weren't good, they weren't bad, they were simply watchable.

However, I will point out something I really liked, although it's hard to explain why. In one episode on Voyager, the whole crew is going crazy trying to solve this brain teaser puzzle. On TNG, a fad like that had a decent shot of being an evil alien conspiracy. On Voyager, it was just a fad like the last one Paris spread around - yo-yos! I don't know why, but that tickled me pink. </TEXT>

Well, I'd be a little weirded out, but I like to think that I'm dating/married to this person for who they are, not how they look. If I'm not going to split up with them for getting into a car accident and losing a limb, or for growing older, or for suddenly developing an inconvenient allergy, or for getting cancer, then I certainly hope I'm not going to ditch them for a relatively minor cosmetic change!

<TEXT> Because people never say that in a vacuum. Instead, they say it specifically to non-whites and women to oh-so-subtly imply that *really* those people only got the job due to affirmative action and not because they are the most qualified.

It's all about the context, and just about the only context in which people say this is to insult those they believe - on zero evidence - should have let a white man get the job instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worse news for the refugees, I should think.

The developed world is facing a population crunch. They're going to have to either accept more refugees and immigrants or watch as their numbers dwindle into irrelevancy.

They're reluctant to do the former because they're worried about the new demographics, but the latter isn't actually a viable plan. </TEXT>

And yes, I would say that in front of my mother (or my father, were he still alive). I'd also say I'd be just as happy had I been switched at birth with some other kid, because I would be. Why not? I wouldn't know any different.

And don't forget, most gays  who want kids adopt. A child in foster care would be grateful for *any* permanent, loving family. This isn't an either/or proposition for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We certainly can't if your response to people who disagree with you is "oh, I think you're lying, welp, best stop talking about it!"

Drives me batty when people throw these things out like we'll all agree, and then refuse to engage with people who don't.

The difference between you and me is *I know people who grew up in households headed by same-sex couples*. I also know people who were raised by grandparents, or by their aunts and uncles, and I know people who were raised in foster care. That last group is the only one that spends much time worrying they would have had a better childhood had they been raised differently, because *any* permanent family would have been better than being shuffled around. 

I don't need to resort to hypotheticals, because I have observation on my side. </TEXT>

I know people who have grown up with gay parents, they're as happy and well-adjusted as anybody else. I know people who have grown up in foster care, they'd've been happier for ANY permanent family, no matter what the composition. 

And I've got the studies to back up the observation of my life. These people don't, which is why they have to rely on random hypotheticals, because they apparently don't realize that there are people who already live their oh-so-scary lives and are just fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About 3% of the population of the US identifies as gay or bisexual. 

However, there is a glaring problem with this number, and that's the fact that it depends on self-identification. We just don't know how many people have same-sex attractions but are unwilling to admit it, even on an anonymous survey. Heck, some of them might not admit it to themselves.

Edit: Google suggests that the percentage of people under 35 who identify as gay or bi is slightly higher than 3%, this is consistent with my speculation above. </TEXT>

On the one hand, a mixed group will have a lot of women who, understandably, may not be comfortable discussing their rapes in front of men.

On the other, you have men who as a result of their rape may be feeling emasculated or other things like that and might feel even more uncomfortable by the unspoken implication that only women get raped.

In this particular case, it makes sense to have two groups. </TEXT>

Difficult as it is to believe, there doesn't have to be desire for this to happen. There are many cases in war-torn places, for example, where men and boys have been forced to rape their sisters, daughters, or grandmothers. Obviously they didn't want to do this.

Women can also force cunnilingus or anally rape others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the late 60s.

Well, let's look at the crime stats. These are national - your own area may be more or less safe than this.

http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm

In 1969 there were 7.3 rapes and 18.5 "forcible rapes" for every 100,000 people. In 2013 the numbers were 4.5 and 25.2, respectively - and there's some serious evidence to suggest that rapes haven't increased, but reporting has. (Certainly, the FBI numbers on rape will start to change now that they count rapes of males instead of just of females.)

In some areas, the numbers are slightly higher than they were in 1969. However, they show a marked decrease from the highs in the 1980s and 90s. 

The truth is that the US has been experiencing a decrease in crime for the past decade and a half by now. There are many ideas for why this might be. Me, I favor the lead hypothesis - an increase in leaded gasoline caused low levels of led poisoning in crowded urban areas, which cased an increase in violent crime 20 years down the line, and when we removed lead from gasoline we saw a corresponding decrease 20 years after that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Calling everyone an "actor" doesn't sound inherently male, because Actor/Actress isn't Male/Female, it's Vague/Female.

I don't know about that. I wouldn't be surprised to find that some people do find "actor" an inherently male word - not a "vague" word. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother tells me the story of her first catechism class (which apparently is the initial root of her eventual departure from Catholicism) where the earnest nun told a room full of Puerto Ricans, Italians, and one Walloon girl (my mother), all of whom were bilingual, that history was from "his story".

She was six years old, sitting there looking at the other classmates thinking "No it is NOT", but she didn't know how to tell Sister Whoever!

Folk etymologies are actually really fascinating sometimes. That's what I tell myself, anyway :) </TEXT>

 First the hooded hostage, and then she doesn't even have the decency to tell Major "Hey Ravi is working on a cure, so we just need to be patient and wait and keep eating dead people brains for a little while and everything will be alright."

That would mean fessing up that Ravi's been lying to him as well.

 Holy shit, suddenly everyone thinks only you can save your brother, yet only you know that you CANT. How is she going to explain that she can't give her blood?

Fess up that she has contracted the sort of disease that prevents you from donating blood. She hasn't told anybody because she wanted to handle it herself. She doesn't have to state that it's Zombieism. She could easily hint it's HIV, that can linger in the body for ages (especially with treatment) before it manifests as AIDS. There are other disease that preclude donation, such as hepatitis or TB, but her mother would probably recognize that she doesn't have those symptoms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except they have some leeway between healthy and raging. How many zombies can there even be in Seattle? If most of them are wealthy, as Blaine preferred, then they could easily simply decamp to other cities, one or two zombies per city, and make use of local morgues.

This would involve getting their own hands dirty, which I'm sure they wouldn't like, but I doubt many of them would really prefer to go on a rampage. </TEXT>

 Most of us probably have seen meteors or shooting stars. A meteor is the flash of light that we see in the night sky when a small chunk of interplanetary debris burns up as it passes through our atmosphere. "Meteor" refers to the flash of light caused by the debris, not the debris itself. 

http://hubblesite.org/reference_desk/faq/answer.php.id=22 cat=solarsystem

So I learned something new! And also, meteors aren't the things that are falling, although I'm never, ever going to say that again. When is that ever going to be helpful to a conversation? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strangely, not. While we don't know exactly what percentage of the population has mosaicism, some studies show that it's more common among transgender individuals - they literally have some cells xx and some xy. 

And there are a surprising number of people out there who present externally as female but are xy. Nobody does a gene test before naming the baby. They just glance at the body and move on.

Not to mention the fact that there are some differences in brain structure from male to female, and transgender individuals have brain structures more like the "opposite" sex than their assigned gender. 

Science shows us that transgender is based on real, provable things.

Regardless, I fail to see how your argument has merit. Let's say they were absolutely making things up. Does it harm you to say "she" instead of "he"? Of course not! So why spend over an hour on reddit commenting about it? </TEXT>

Indeed. You, for example, believe that somebody's genetic makeup is more important than their self-identification. You believe that something you say you don't care about is more important than good manners. You believe that this sort of argument is more important than other people's happiness and general well-being.

<TEXT> Look, if you came up to me and said "squeek squeek I'm a squirrel", all I'd say is "You want a peanut?"

This is not the hill I'm willing to die on. If somebody tells me they're a man or a woman, it's a lot easier - and certainly more polite - to just go "yup, okay" than to argue with them. Because they care and *I don't*. So why not go with the flow? It's not important to me, after all.

Edit: Peanuts and sunflower seeds are not good for squirrels. Do not give peanuts to squirrels. Excessive consumption of peanuts is linked to bone deformities in squirrels. If you want to feed the squirrels, tree nuts are a better choice, along with lentils, seeds, and dried corn in moderation. Some fresh fruit will also not go amiss. I use the term simply because it is more euphonious than "You want some pecans and maybe a small amount of lentils?" </TEXT>

And nobody ever mentions this episode, as near as I can tell. Well, that Tuvok was slightly more willing to go with the procedure than Tuvix had been. Why the heck did Voyager do the same plot twice with the same character? </TEXT>

Okay, Rodenberry, I get that you're an atheist. I'm an atheist. We're all atheists... or we will be in the future, anyway (I'm actually an atheist today and have been my whole life). Atheism is awesome! But can you stop being a snotty *jerk* about it? Sheesh.

Well, I don't suppose it's a profession that benefits from too much naval gazing.

Also: Band chick is an idiot. Irredeemably stupid.

Also: Major is also an idiot. Irredeemably stupid. Cute, and sweet, and dumber than the proverbial box of rocks. I'm not sure cute and sweet is enough to explain why Liv hooked up with him in the first place. Is he, like, really great in the sack?

<TEXT> Plus, by rendering those two planets uninhabitable by their respective enemies, Sisko effectively removed them from the gameboard. The relocated Federation colony was guaranteed not to be troubled by Cardassians again, and I bet even the Dominion left them more or less alone (at least when they were playing at being friends with Cardassia.)

Likewise, their Cardassian counterparts had no fear of reprisals by the Maquis for anything Cardassia did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know, I never got that episode. I mean, if you accept the premises it's a great ep, but the premises don't make any sense.

Crazy cult leader talks about how "we have more supporters than you think", and indeed, *somebody* (who didn't deign to travel with them) invented that device. (And a different group of people with broadly similar aims sabotaged Risa that time - really, I'd love to have seen Star Trek tackle its malcontents more.)

There must be billions and billions of humans in the Federation, and god knows how many other biologically compatible (you know, fertility-wise) species. Even if her actual number of supporters was a ludicrously low percentage, she surely could have gotten actual *volunteers* to live in her low-tech colony in the boondocks. Even if they couldn't get an official Federation charter, they could've still "crashed" the ship in the usual way, except they all would have been more prepared for roughing it.

Even for a crazy cult leader with delusions of grandeur, she certainly doesn't seem to have approached this logically. </TEXT>

The population which got a second opinion comes from the 30% of Americans who don't feel confident in their doctor's advice and do see a need to gather additional information.

<TEXT>  Also, wouldn't you be at least a little upset if you knew that your body (or the body of your SO, parent, or sibling) was free for anyone to do anything with after they die?

No, I wouldn't. They're not there. They're dead. Their body is just so much meat. To me, this is like asking "Wouldn't you be at least a little upset if you knew that your house (or your mom's house) was free for anyone to do anything with after you move?" Why should I care? I've moved! So you can repaint in colors I hate, or screw in what used to be the nursery, or tear the whole thing to the ground for all I care.

What's the alternative? Stick the body in the ground until the worms and maggots devour it? Leave it on top of the ground for the vultures to eat, a so-called "sky burial"? Or burn it to a crisp and then deal with the cremains? They aren't just ashes, there are bone fragments, and prior to burning any internal devices, such as pacemakers, have to be removed.

Nothing that happens to the body after death is pretty. Thankfully, we're no longer there to experience it. My body isn't who I am, it's just where I live. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Have you noticed Hermione didn't seem to have any muggle friends before going to hogwarts?

Why, because she never mentions them? Does that mean Dean had no muggle friends? Neville and Seamus and Ron had had no friends of any sort? 

 No they are nice people, she goes skiing with them in Paris and things like that during the summer.

Skiing's not really her thing.

I have no idea what sort of people the Grangers might be, but I really dislike it when people assume that superficial things - like going on vacation with your child - mean that you're a good person or a good parent. Plenty of people who are subpar parents or actually abusive take those kids skiing and whatnot, for lots of them it's more important to *look* like a good parent to others than to *be* a good parent to their child.

(That doesn't mean that the fact they took her skiing makes them BAD parents. It means that the skiing and the vacations are no proof one way or another.) </TEXT>

And while I, too, look forward to our inevitable post-scarcity paradise (well, assuming we don't hit the equally inevitable climate-change fueled dystopian horrorland instead, and yes, I know what inevitable is supposed to mean :P), the years between now and then are gonna *suck* as we transition to new assumptions and ways of living. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mmm. It's certainly true that less than 4% of the US population self-identifies as gay or bisexual in surveys.

However, that doesn't mean that less than 4% of the US population feels any same-sex attraction.

Dealing with self-reporting can give you odd results if people feel a pressure to identify as straight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a bit of an outcry when Netflix released Daredevil without audio description - and Netflix *did* know this kind of thing exists, because people have been asking them for over a decade to include it on some of their programming.

As with closed captioning, some providers are required by law to produce a certain amount of programming every year with audio description. Netflix's argument was that they are not included in that law (that was the same argument they used about CC until they settled out of court), but after the media around Daredevil they have agreed to add audio description to some of their shows and movies, including Daredevil.

It costs between $2,000 and $8,000, IIRC, to provide audio description for one hour of scripted entertainment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Demons, spirits, afterlives, none of that have any bearing on whether or not there are deities.

If you define "gods" as "beings who can do things I cannot do", then by that definition Superman is a god. Heck, so is my *cat*. She can see in the dark. (Of course, she's terribly nearsighted, like all cats, but such is life.)

Perhaps you define it as "beings who can do things I can't do and also can't explain". My cat is off the pantheon, Superman is still on. I sure as heck can't explain how that dude can leap tall buildings in a single bound *without* leaving giant holes in the pavement every time he lifts off.

Merriam-Webster defines "god" as follows:

a being or object believed to have more than natural attributes and powers and to require human worship; specifically :  one controlling a particular aspect or part of reality 

I suppose that does knock out Superman (finally), but it still leaves the field marvelously open with all sorts of beings that aren't conventionally considered deities of any sort.

Additionally, even if you acknowledge that deities exist, it doesn't follow that you acknowledge that you, personally, ought to worship them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> She's at an amusement park. She's a customer. The park's sole purpose is to entertain customers. It's not to enforce arbitrary rules. Simply requesting a seating arrangement that makes her more comfortable is ipso facto "unreasonable"? 

I don't subscribe to "the customer is always right", but it seems a poor policy to act as though any request to alter SOP is automatically "unreasonable".

Now, this request may have legitimately *been* unreasonable. Especially if the park was crowded, they may not be able to accommodate repeated seating requests without delaying everybody else and making all their other customers unhappy. But her simply *asking* is not unreasonable. Unless you ask, you don't know what the response will be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your point *is invalid* because you are *not correct*. Many people who went west had no intention of settling  and *all* of them were implicitly going to wage war on the existing inhabitants. Many of those people brought their families. Nitpicking word choice and saying "you made a mistake so you're wrong" is almost as childish as downvoting people who disagree with you. I may as well say "your point is wrong because there is no such thing as the "*oregan" trail." 

You can keep repeating "they all went to settle, they all went to settle, they all went to settle" at the top of your little lungs, but it's not going to make that statement any more true.

Furthermore, even if that had been the intent of every single emigrant who went west - so what? It is not morally better to put your child at risk because you want to "settle" than because you want to "explore". If you're trying to make that claim, you need to have some sort of argument to back it up. And, to be clear, an argument is not "settling isn't exploring! settling isn't waging war!" You need to provide some basis for why the two activities are morally different. (And it *was* waging war, ffs, so, again, that argument is utterly invalid. Why the heck do you think there are so many forts along the Oregon Trail?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not missing your point. I'm saying I *disagree* with it. Contrary to what you might believe, when two people disagree it is not always because one doesn't understand the other.

Among other things, your point is invalid because not every settler who went west - even those who brought their families - had any intention of "settling new territory". Many of them planned to go out for a time and then come back and had no intent to "make a new home". Your analogy is false. An argument based on that analogy fails at the start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not all of them actually planned to "settle" and "colonize". You'd be surprised how many just intended to make a quick buck and go home - and yes, many of them still either brought their kids with them or made more while they were out there!

And they *all* knew the risks of the behavior and the high child mortality rate. Choosing to go from London to America with your children, or from New York to Utah or Oregon (back in the earlier days of those movements), was putting those children's lives in more than usual danger, and their parents absolutely knew it. They made their choice. It's not like it's somehow a more responsible act to increase your kid's chance of premature death if you plan to settle than if you just plan to explore. The end result is the same.

Really, what *is* the child mortality rate for Federation children being raised on starships? I don't know. Do you? My guess is it isn't much higher than that of children raised on planets - and it's much lower than that of people on the freaking Oregon Trail. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Did Lewis and Clark bring 4-year-old children with them on their expedition? Did Magellan? Would it be a good idea?

Sacajawea did. And yes, while 4 is a little young, children Wesley's age and younger were employed on exploratory vessels and warships when Columbus and Magellan were sailing around the world. We speak of "men" serving on those ships, but by our standards many of them were *boys*. It wasn't that uncommon for them to still be in their single digits, only eight or nine years old.

http://www.thepeacefulsea.com/life-at-sea.html

 If I had my kids aboard the Enterprise, I'd sure be getting them off at the next starbase after the auto-destruct countdown in Where Silence Has Lease. Imagine telling your children they were going to die (or not telling them) and getting down to just a few seconds... for a normal person, that would be a traumatizing experience, but for the Enterprise crew (and civilians, and children) that's just Tuesday.

So you stay home, and because "home" is a colony in the Borg's path, you all get assimilated.

Or you don't, but the Dominion invades and you lose everything.

Or the sun explodes and you all die.

Or somebody is really pissed about the sun thing, so he goes back in time, comes to your world and, logically, pays you back by destroying your sun. (Man, what a stupid thing to do. Why not give Romulus a head's up so they can begin fixing the problem before it starts? Well, I guess that's why the baddy wasn't a Vulcan.)

Or your kid likes to play Parisi Squares, and they get into an accident and die.

Or a visiting alien brings a disease they picked up on some other planet, something undetectable and with a long incubation rate, but highly contagious, and everybody dies. (Don't think I pulled this one from an existing ST plot, so don't ask.)

The point is, there are no guarantees in life. Death comes *unexpectedly*, that's kinda the whole point. You think it's gonna hit you on the Enterprise, so you decide to go sightseeing on Earth, but it turns out it's waiting for you in Samarra the whole time. Whoops.  You can't really be safe, no matter where you go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> DS9 has the "arc-based" storytelling that we're used to nowadays, the other series are much more episodic in nature. For that reason, I for one find it an easier watch than the other series, in which every episode unrealistically has a reset button and they always seem to end on a joke no matter how many hapless ensigns have been killed by the space monster or the cunningly disguised social allegory *this* week. (Yes, this is a hugely broad brush I'm painting with. I'm not actually intending to insult anybody's favorite Trek. Each series has its good points and its low points, its shining episodes and its clunkers.)

However, if you're going to *start* with DS9 you'll miss some of the references that you're expected to just know. Might as well go watch Babylon 5, right? 

Sooooo, even though TNG is not my favorite series by a long shot (notwithstanding the fact that Patrick Stewart is terrific in every part he ever plays ever), I'd say start with that. Just feel free to skip over any episode, especially in the first couple of seasons, that is excessively stupid or cheesy. If you're still cringing after the first ten minutes, read the synopsis at Memory Alpha and move on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing. Remember why they wouldn't intervene directly during the Occupation? What Cardassia did on Bajor was officially considered an internal problem and none of their business.

My guess is that within recognized Federation space they put up warning beacons or some such stating that no contact is allowed and violators will be charged with a crime, but they may not be able to enforce that outside of more heavily populated regions of space, and there's nothing they can do for pre-warp cultures in neutral territory or otherwise outside of the Federation, even if the planet happens to have been surveyed by a Federation ship first.

But it's possible they have some sort of treaty with the other major players regarding who "owns" surveyed planets that aren't clearly in one group's territory, where the one who is in control of the planet (possibly by being the first one to register that they've surveyed it - this is all my thinking as I type on what would be the most likely approach) gets to make the rules. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alternative answer: Earth is currently going through a fad for history and past cultures. (We have no idea if this trend is widespread through the Federation. All your examples are of humans.) Everything old is new again, and in another two decades the fashion will be to be stunningly up-to-date and profess ignorance of history.

Alternative two: Like before, except that it's not "Earth" it's just "Starfleet", perhaps under the influence of a couple of prominent captains and admirals, such as Picard, that everybody wants to emulate and that happen to have an interest in the past. (Except it's too obvious to be obsessed with Shakespeare and classical music and jazz because Picard is your hero and Riker is your runner-up, or baseball because you've read everything you can on Sisko who is SO awesome, so instead you focus on rock music or Cold War spy dramas or the Alamo or, I don't know, King Arthur.)

<TEXT> Is it? We see a wide range of Cardassian personalities on DS9 - Cardassians who wish to force their people to recognize the crimes committed on Bajor, Cardassians who want to institute democratic reforms, Cardassian soldiers who are stolid and unemotional and lacking that certain creativity needed to engage in productive backstabbing (that's Damar)....

Tangent: Now that I think about it, DS9 is as much about the Cardassians as it is about Bajorans.

The two Cardassians we see the most are Dukat and Garak. I'll tackle Garak first.

Obviously, Garak is capable of backstabbing people with aplomb. I'll take it as given that this goes with the territory when you're a member of the Obsidian Order. I'll *not* take it as given that every Cardassian is equally capable of being a member of said order, no more than every human and Vulcan is capable of being a member of Section 31. However, on the show, how often do we really see him backstabbing people? And when we do see it, do we *ever* see him doing this just because he had a whim to do so? If you ask me, the one defining feature of Garak is his steadfast loyalty to his people and his willingness to suffer to improve things for Cardassia. That's his own never-ending sacrifice. If he does betray people, he does it for what he has determined is a good cause - not just because it seems like fun.

Then there's Dukat. And Dukat is so backstabby that his own superior officers didn't trust him not to flee if the station got blown up. Good call. But two things. First, Dukat is crazy - and if that episode where he hallucinates proves anything, it proves that he's been crazy a *long* time. The hallucinations might be new, but they're just gravy. Secondly, even Dukat doesn't just backstab everybody just for the lulz. Consider his relationship with Kira. He promised her mother that he'd look out for her children. Pragmatically speaking, he didn't have to keep that promise. Really, what was the woman gonna do if he violated it, complain? But not only did he keep it, but he continued to keep it (according to the novels anyway) after her death. Kira may be right that Dukat is a selfish bastard who doesn't know what love is, but he certainly made the effort. Or consider Ziyal - actually, let's consider Ziyal in a separate paragraph.

Ziyal is a sweet, friendly young woman who couldn't backstab an armadillo. Yes, you're thinking, but she was half Bajoran and raised Bajoran. Consider the years in the slave camp, though. The other Cardassians freely warned her that her father might not save her. They didn't betray her, they gave her useful advice. And when her father *does* decide to bring her home, he sticks with her, even though this does him no favors with his family. Dukat clearly has the capability to refrain from casual sociopathy.

Now, let's look at Seska. Seska backstabs everybody all over the place, and for what purpose? Her actions have no chance of gaining her anything, and she keeps doing it even as they make her position more and more precarious. FFS, when Chakotay told Janeway that little parable about the scorpion and the frog, he wasn't talking about the Borg, he meant Seska! The Borg were more reliable than her!

If Seska had sought to improve her situation without considering how it affected others, that would be at least consistent with the more backstabby Cardassians we see, such as Dukat. But she just betrayed people for kicks! Stupid and pointless. Not the hallmarks of a compelling character, and not a terribly convincing portrayal of the Cardassian mindset either. </TEXT>

Instead, she was just another Cardassian infected by chronic backstabbing syndrome.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are multiple benefits to reducing light pollution, as listed upthread.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627884/

 If you see it as such a big priority, and if it is really so easy, why don't you so it for them? If you pay for it out of pocket and handle the installation, I'm sure plenty of buildings would be more than happy for you to install some energy saving equipment.

Whatever happened to personal responsibility? </TEXT>

So you can butt into my life, but the government can't butt into yours, is that it? </TEXT>

Having the lights on a motion sensitive dimmer might also help - say, if they were dim normally, but brightened up a little when a person car went under them. But I don't know how feasible that upgrade would be. </TEXT>

My rule of thumb is that if I'm pretty sure they're still doing whatever terrible thing it is (or would still be doing it if they had the chance), then I won't financially support them. If they've stopped doing it (or are dead), then so long as the art itself doesn't glorify rape or abuse, I'm okay with it. Other people will have different personal approaches, and that's all right too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the difference between 6 months and 8 months really isn't a big difference to me or anyone.

At 25 weeks of pregnancy the is a 50% chance at viability with medical assistance in case of a premature birth. At 32 weeks, that chance is at 96%. At 22 weeks, the chance is 0%.

 It's right there in the article that it won't change abortion legality when it comes to certain medical conditions, rape, and incest. That's the point.

Elective abortions are still legal - if rare - at 21 weeks. And don't forget that in addition to the closing of abortion clinics throughout the US, many states have mandatory "waiting periods" between when you go in to get an abortion and when you are able to have it done. Those can push you closer to the 20 week mark. 

It's not terribly uncommon for a woman to not know she's pregnant until three or four months. My own mother didn't know she was pregnant with me until four months, because she was traveling and she always had a late period when traveling! Women who have irregular periods are especially prone to not realizing that *this* time it's late because of a pregnancy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Elective abortions at eight or nine months aren't legal, so I don't see what you're arguing about. The only abortions at that point are when the fetus is already dead, or has a condition incompatible with life that puts the mother at risk if she tries to carry to term anyway.

You're creating a false connection between "abortions at 21 weeks" (rare, but legal, and generally for medical reasons instead of elective reasons) and "abortions at 8 months" (not legal except where medically indicated). That's like if a vegan shows up and tries to claim that my eating some fried chicken is *exactly the same* as my eating elephant steaks because, you know, elephants are an endangered species and highly intelligent. </TEXT>

1. Poor Eddie looks broken. Aw! Eddie! *hugs*

2. Was that whole convo with the DA just so we could be told "Yup, we know that the prison thing is dubiously ethical *at best*"? (Even with the movie nights.) Because it seems like it was shoehorned in.

3. Maybe I shouldn't, but I really like Snart. I mean, *really*.

4. My goodness, what was it Barry couldn't agree to? Large sums of cash? Weapons? A three day free-for-all? A date with Lisa? A date with *Leonard*? ARGH! I WANNA KNOW!

5. Actually, Snart/Barry would be kinda hot. I mean cool. I mean... you know what I mean. I'll be in my bunk.

6. And you guys all say that *Iris* is pointlessly emotional. Mind, I'd be pretty upset by that revelation myself.

7. WHY THE HELL DON'T THEY LOCK THE DOOR??? Or put up some surveillance or *something*? Geez!

8. Now Barry's having a meltdown. And you all say... oh, never mind. I suppose anybody would be upset by current events.

9. Caitlin, I was wondering the same thing. Barry never resists a chance to yank off that stupid thing, reveal his identity to the world but now he keeps it on? What, is he afraid of somebody walking in? THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF YOU WOULD LOCK THE DOORS!

10. Geez, Barry was right to roll his eyes, Caitlin *is* really uptight. Is now the right time to be worried about who kissed whom?

11. Did they... not even warn these folks in advance about what was going to happen? Cisco! You have movie nights and disco with these guys! Joe! You want to rehabilitate them! Barry! You're irrationally concerned about saving their lives even as you violate each and every one of their basic freedoms and human rights! Geez, guys, pretend to be upstanding citizens already!

12. FFS, and they didn't restrain these guys at all in the truck? Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I thought these people were supposed to be smart, all of them.

13. Well, Snart was smart. Man, I probably shouldn't, but I *really* like him.

14. Ah, the big showdown!

15. Ollie, Barry IS moving!

16. God, I love a good fight scene.  Now I just need to watch next week's previews. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please don't. Set it up so that the money goes to the Autism Society of America or the Autism Self Advocacy Network instead. 

Only 4% of the funds AS takes in go on services to help autistics and their families. Their board members have salaries higher than the norm for comparable organizations. The flyer posted upthread gives a good rundown of some of their issues, but believe me, it's just the tip of the iceberg.

<TEXT> Because they are evil. I do not throw that word around lightly.

Let me tell you a funny anecdote. Two years ago I read an article about a woman who had gotten a new job. It was a great job, and she just had one small issue. She asked - asked, not demanded - if she could leave work a few hours early one day a week so she could meet her autistic son on his early dismissal day. She wanted to work from home in the afternoon that day, or perhaps come in a couple of hours earlier and make up the time that way. For simply *asking* if this was a possibility, they rescinded the job offer.

I posted this story on my blog and asked some real life friends this question: Which not-for-profit is involved here?

Obviously you know, because I wouldn't tell this story without a point, but they didn't have the hints you did, I just dropped this subject in out of nowhere. Would you believe that out of the twentyfive people I asked, *every single one of them* got it right on the first try?

Do you know why? Because it's always freaking Autism Speaks! When you hear that a kindergarten teacher led the class in voting out an autistic student, do you know which is the sole autism organization not to condemn this behavior? Autism Speaks! When you hear that a facility in the US has been condemned by the UN for shocking its residents, do you know which is the sole autism organization to recommend this facility to parents? Autism Speaks! When you hear that one organization gives its board members a higher salary than comparable organizations, and in fact gave them a *raise* in the middle of a recession, when similar organizations were cutting their costs, which organization is that? Autism Speaks! 

I'm not even mentioning the Autism Every Day debacle. (http://www.veoh.com/watch/e133765ejW4nXnh?h1=Autism+Everyday) In the wake of that little film, two autistic children were murdered by their parents in the US, Christopher DeGroot and Katie McCarron. Christopher's parents *locked him in his room* and set the house on fire. They didn't serve any prison time. Given that the film shows a mother stating *in front of her verbal autistic daughter* that the only thing that has kept her from killing herself and that daughter is thoughts of what it would do to her NT daughter (which is tacky, if nothing else), the whole situation was a public relations disaster. And do you know what their response was? "Every parent of a child with autism secretly wants their child dead."

Bullshit. 

I have been following news stories about Autism Speaks since they arrived on the scene. Not once in ten years have they not been utterly and totally in the wrong. That's an impressive track record. I'm dead serious, I'd sooner give all my money to the Scientologists and go live as a clown than let one penny of mine enter Autism Speaks' grubby little pockets.

If you want to donate to an autism related organization, I suggest either the Autism Self Advocacy Network or the Autism Society of America. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, abortion isn't murder - abortion being murder is generally held as  a *right wing position*,  btw, not a left wing one, and so has nothing to do with "social justice warriors" - but, again, those countries which ban it *cannot* allow it in the case of rape without revealing their own hypocrisy, as the only reason they have for such a ban is "well, it's murder".

They can allow it to protect the life of the mother without looking terribly hypocritical, but that's it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seems a little inconsistent.

If you're anti-abortion because you think it's murder - and many do think that, even at very early stages where there's no brain stem, much less brain *activity* - it's not suddenly less murder because the mother was raped. 

Either elective abortion (that is, abortion not because the fetus has a condition incompatible with life or is already dead and not because the mother's life is at risk) at various points during pregnancy should be legal or it should not. Those who are anti-abortion can't *afford* to cede on the rape front because that shows their position as hypocritical. </TEXT>

And autism *isn't* on the rise, ffs. I've already addressed this, and I'm pretty sure I did it in response to you. If you use the current diagnostic standards and sift through a randomly chosen group of adults, you will find the same rate of autism as you will in children.

Come to think, I'm pretty sure I addressed the Amish myth to you as well. The Amish have just as much autism as anybody else - and they get vaccinated at the same rates as the rest of the population, and their food is NOT organic. They use GMOs and conventional farming techniques, the same amount of pesticides and herbicides as anybody else.  </TEXT>

Not in Washington, except with federally licensed firearms dealers, and you can find out about that if you scroll down to the summary of federal law section. Suffice to say, the guy selling the gun may not even have been breaking the law if he makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. He just does these sales in alleys for kicks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I see. Well, it's pretty common among autistics, especially those of us with gross motor issues. I don't know what else could cause it, but I'm sure there could be any number of things. It's *really* common for people who are interested in the subject and think they might be on the spectrum to start attributing anything and everything to autism - but it's equally common for people who don't know about it or who are in denial to strenuously insist on any other explanation, no matter how far-fetched, for anything that looks "autistic". (This paragraph is mostly pedantry, do not assume I'm saying you do any of this!)

 what can I do about it other than develop compensating habits

<TEXT> For a fun, anecdotal version of this: http://www.backfromnature.org/2015/03/i-gave-my-child-autism.html

Notice it took her several years to put the pieces together, and even then, somebody had to outright suggest it to her. She was open to the suggestion. Many parents of autistic children are in strong denial about their own place on the spectrum.

From my own life, after I started pursuing a diagnosis I started having a lot of conversations with my mother that went like this: 

Me: This article, bah, it talks about this autistic kid and it says he 'doesn't play with his toys, just lines them up', which is ridiculous because - 

Mom: Yeah, it is. That's how children play!

Me: Um, sure. If they're autistic.

Mom: Well, that's how I played as a child, and my brother did too, and so did you!

Me: Uh-huh. Well, we've established that *I* am autistic....

(In point of fact, my mother had established that in my infancy. Nobody bothered to inform me of this, despite actively seeking a diagnosis during my childhood. It was very character-building to sort it all out on my own as a teenager. I never want my character built ever again.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. The assortative mating theory of autism... well, I disagree with the essential premise that actual incidence rates of autism are increasing, however, it's backed on sound evidence.

Autism does have a strong genetic component. It is common for autistics and members of the broader autistic phenotype to self-select friends and spouses who are also on the spectrum. (Anecdotally, that's how I got here. Hi.) That's all.

<TEXT> Damn, it's been years since I've heard about the Amish. Where do I start?

Well, let's start with the fact that if you know what you're looking at, the Amish have autism rates about the same as everybody else. They simply don't diagnose as much.

Even if they DID have a low rate of autism, they also have one of the highest rates of polydactyly in the world. Why? The founder effect. So that could also explain it - a founder effect that leads to reduced cases in autism. (But doesn't, because they don't have less autism than the rest of us.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many older autistics were never diagnosed. Others may have been diagnosed (either as children or adults) but simply don't disclose that information to everybody. Still others who need more support did receive a diagnosis and were institutionalized, meaning the odds of people outside their family meeting them are slim.

At least one study has shown that when you take adults and use current screening methods, you find the same rate of autism as you do in children.

For the record, my grandfather was autistic. My mother has a second cousin who was almost certainly autistic. I strongly suspect both parents, both grandmothers, and my maternal uncle are part of the "broader autistic phenotype". I have several friends who are older than 30 who are autistic - and I only met about *half* of them on autistic-specific fora.

<TEXT> Recent studies have shown that genes for intelligence are linked to genes for autism: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150310105232.htm

And when you give IQ tests that aren't biased towards verbal skills, autistics do as well as NTs: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hidden-potential-of-autistic-kids/ (I had a better link at once point, but that was two computers ago)

So your therapist suggesting this has nothing to do with your intelligence, real or perceived. 

Additionally, many autistics have had healthy relationships and professional success. Of course, you can show every possible trait for autism, and if it's not negatively affecting your ability to work, go to school, or generally live your life you won't qualify for a diagnosis. Still, I assume that you had *some* problem that led you to a therapist. It wasn't unreasonable for him to try to figure out what it was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much. The diagnostic standards have dramatically changed in two ways.

First, they've changed to encompass the idea of an autism "spectrum". Many of the kids getting diagnosed today (and the adults as well!) would not/did not get a diagnosis 30 years ago simply because they could speak. They got a diagnosis of ADD or they got no diagnosis at all.

Secondly, even for those "low functioning" autistics, it is much easier to get a diagnosis. It used to be the case that the default diagnosis was *childhood schizophrenia*, that if you didn't hit enough criteria, that's the label you got. And if you're about to say that the two are nothing alike - you're right! But that's how it shook out. Other autistics were misdiagnosed as mentally retarded, which is kinda a catchall.

Additionally, reporting was half-assed back in the day. When the diagnoses started going up, mandatory reporting was improved. Then people realized how much more common it was than they had thought, and that made them look for it harder. It's a little feedback loop at this point in the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are incorrect. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of autism in adults is the same as in children, once you bring adults in to be diagnosed.

I once made a long comment about this, and lucky for me I saved it to my computer because now I can't find the original. Just gonna c+p it here for you:

Okay, now people have been screaming about the rising diagnosis rates for autism since the mid-90s. They say that increased awareness cannot possibly account for all the increase. I submit that it certainly can and probably does for several reasons.

First, starting with the publication of the DSM-IV in the early 90s the diagnostic criteria for autism changed significantly. It became much easier to obtain. Previously, if you did not perfectly match the criteria you got a diagnosis of the catch-all "mental retardation" or even of "childhood schizophrenia" - and if you're about to say that autism is nothing like schizophrenia, don't bother, I know. But that's how the diagnosis was back then. Since it was easier to get a diagnosis of autism, naturally, diagnoses went up. (And every time I say "diagnoses went up", remember that this means awareness went up as well.)

Secondly, at that same time, "asperger's" as entered into the DSM, and the whole concept of an autistic spectrum emerged. Plenty of children who would have received no diagnosis at all prior to this, or who would've been diagnosed as ADD or as OCD were now obtaining diagnoses such as Asperger's, HFA, or PDD-NOS. (This actually happened to me. My parents dragged me around to doctors for years trying to get me diagnosed (my mother had apparently worked with autistic students for a while, and they'd read some books by Temple Grandin), but back in the day you basically couldn't get diagnosed as autistic if you could speak, especially if you were bright and/or female. When I got diagnosed as an adult I was told it was really pretty obvious. Trust me, I don't act more autistic now than I did as a kid!) Of course, the thing to take away from this is that diagnoses went up.

Thirdly, prior to the 90s, reporting of autism was sporadic at best. Many states made no reports of cases of autism, or only half-hearted ones. But as awareness continued to rise, more and more states started making better and better reports, allowing us to get a better grasp of new cases being diagnosed. And this, of course, in and of itself led to increased awareness.

Increased awareness is, of course, the fourth piece of the puzzle, the one all the others lead to. Doctors, as we know, are told "when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras". Sound advice in most situations - if it looks like a cold, it probably IS a cold. But the problem comes when what you think is a zebra is really a horse.

Prior to the DSM-IV, doctors were told that the autism risk was something like 1 in 10,000. And parents didn't really hear about it at all, or if they did they thought of "Rain Man", and if their kid didn't match that profile perfectly (given that Kim Peek, the inspiration for the character, wasn't autistic they shouldn't expect that), assumed that the term "autistic" didn't apply to their child and didn't ask doctors to look into it. (I am certain that if I had been given the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers as a toddler I would have been diagnosed much sooner. I would have failed it at 18 months. Heck, I would have failed it at 8 years, and that's not an exaggeration. Now it's standard, but it wasn't when I was a child.) Because the doctors parents went to assumed it was rare, they didn't look for it, and so they failed to diagnose it. But as awareness continued to rise, doctors were more and more likely to look for autism, and thus more and more likely to diagnose it. And when the alarmist bells started to ring about how autism is "increasing", doctors and parents BOTH started to look for it a LOT more.

Now, of course, this all doesn't show that incidence is the same as it has always been, simply that incidence could be the same as it has always been. Anecdotally, though, I will say that it is a very common story among adult autistics to be diagnosed only after a child in the family is diagnosed. Sometime during the process they start to realize that everything that applies to this kid also applies to them, and then they get diagnosed. Not so anecdotally, at least one study has shown that the rate in adults is really no different from the rate in children: http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/autism-epidemic-challenged-uk-study/story?id=13518453 (I've seen other sources, but it's been a while since I avidly kept up on autism news).

Another note: Many people on my family match the broader autistic phenotype. My maternal grandfather was most definitely autistic. Last time I said this, the person I was speaking to literally replied that this was impossible because autism didn't even exist until Kanner started studying it in the 1940s. I suppose that is the logical conclusion of "rates and incidence are always the same", but I laughed right in her face. Kanner himself noted that the parents of the children he worked with showed autistic traits. (It is this observation that led to the monstrous "refrigerator mother" hypothesis  which has now been thoroughly debunked, but the observation itself was quite correct.) You can see, though, if you haven't thought of it, that we really only have accurate information about autism going back a few generations at best. It's only recently, for example, that we've found that men who are older when they father their first child are more likely to have an autistic child (that applies to my father!) or grandchild (and that one applies to my mother's father). The jury is most definitely out on why this should be so, though - is it because something happens to the sperm as men age? Or is it because men and women who show autistic traits are slower to enter into relationships and take longer to start having sex? That is also most definitely possible - just as it is possible that people who show autistic traits prefer to be in relationships with other people who show autistic traits, a form of assortive mating, and one that is evidently true within my own family, though I cannot speak for how common that really is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Incorrect... or, at least, only partially correct. Prior to the DSM-IV, people with Asperger's couldn't get diagnosed, and thus weren't included in the statistics... which, back then, were fairly patchy.

It's fairly common for adult autistics to only get a diagnosis now after a child in the family is diagnosed. Heck, my parents *knew* I was on the spectrum, and they tried to get a diagnosis back then, but it just didn't happen. I was a girl, I could talk quite well (well, if you don't consider that an inability to switch out of a formal register and a marked difficulty with figurative speech are problematic) and so little things like the fact that I didn't make eye contact or point to things at the age of eight were overlooked. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Yeah, that's a clever dodge, except that Trek didn't operate that way until the Abrams films, so the writers of that episode did wipe out the timeline in favor of that new one. 

Oh, didn't it? I present [Exhibit A: Parallels.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29) As seen in that episode, diverging histories lead to divergent universes. The multiverse is, and has been canon, and not just the mirror universe. As further proof, we have [Deadlock](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Deadlock_%28episode%29) - two Voyagers enter, one Voyager leaves. (And nobody ever brings it up again, which is odd, but par for the course.)

To our knowledge, none of these alternate worlds were caused by time travel. However, our knowledge is patchy at best. We don't know the exact circumstances that created *any* of those branches in the multiverse. Therefore, it could have worked that way from the beginning. You certainly cannot assert confidently that it did *not*.

As proof that Janeway did care, the people who were in on her plan had made plans for the future. They expected to keep on living even if she succeeded in her one-woman mission. Barclay did not run off to Risa, he continued teaching. The Doctor didn't immediately run and tattle to Starfleet Command, he only told Harry. Kim did not laugh madly as he decided to help her, he pointed out he would get "demoted to ensign" once caught.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Ravi becoming a zombie. Has potential. I kinda ship Ravi/Liv anyway.

2. Maybe it's because Iris finally found out on The Flash about, well, The Flash, but I'm big on bringing people into the loop. Specifically, Major. Major needs to be brought in on this whole zombie thing. (And eventually Clive does as well.)

3. I knew zombie!Arthur had a 50/50 shot of being bad news.

4. What the hell did Blaine mean "she has her part to play" or whatever exactly he said? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the fact that she wiped out an entire timeline at the end of the series in order to satisfy her own selfish wants and desires is in itself reason to detest her and not want to emulate or champion anything about her.

So did Jake Sisko, but he doesn't get this level of hate. Neither does Harry Kim, for that matter. (And if we believe that the new Star Trek movies exist simultaneously with TOS - which is what the writers insist is the case - then surely Janeway did the same thing. She didn't "wipe out" a timeline, she just created an additional one that runs alongside the first.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I must say, only eating orange food is a new one by me :) With toddlers, so often they'll only eat white foods (rice, pasta, cheese sticks, plain chicken breast) or only eat brown foods (chicken nuggets, peanut butter, chocolate chip cookies). Orange at least gives you room for healthy foods, even if many of them will turn her orange! (But it's harmless, seriously.)

I would suggest that if she is eating fewer than 15 foods and this has been going on for longer than three months, or if this is severely impacting her health and/or ability to function, or if you have reason to suspect that this might be a component of a broader disorder such as autism, reflux, or sensory processing disorder, that you speak to your pediatrician about getting a referral to a speech-language pathologist (yes, even if she has no speech issues) or an occupational therapist to help with the "pickiness". 

That's not intended to scare you. I suggest it every time, because so often parents don't know where the line is between "normal pickiness" and "not normal pickiness" is.

If you're confident she's in the normal range, then what you want to do is start with baby steps. This might mean having her get through dinner without screaming that you put some green beans on her plate and don't you KNOW she HATES those. Or, if she is willing to sit with those things on her plate, it might mean getting her to sniff the green bean and maybe put it in her mouth before quietly spitting it out. Baaaaaby steps. 

What sort of foods does she eat right now? I'm thinking squashes, sweet potato, carrots, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, oranges, tangerines? Anything else? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My own mother went (so she says) three years on pasta, salami, mushrooms, and apples. Her parents figured they were doing a good job getting her to eat and didn't stress it. "Disciplining" children for food issues is counterproductive - it just turns the dinner table into a battleground and entrenches their rule to "never eat that yucky stuff".

Oh, and in my mother's case? She hadn't "decided to be picky". She had undiagnosed asthma and only ate foods that she knew from experience she could eat without having to chew too long, because if she had her mouth shut she *couldn't breathe*. There are many reasons for a child to go through periods of refusing certain foods. Many aspies, for example, go through bouts of only eating foods of a certain color, and it's terribly common for children of all stripes to be unable to eat certain textures of food. Rarely is it them "deciding" to be "picky". </TEXT>

So... what do you like to eat? Maybe we can figure out some ways to make 'em cheaper and healthier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, first of all, you're assuming that Julian is utterly truthful about how impaired he was before the procedure. That's the assumption I usually make as well - no exaggeration, he's not misremembering. However, in fairness, it is *possible* he is mistaken somehow.

So you've more or less asked two questions resting on that assumption.

The first is, why on earth didn't Julian merit genetic treatment under the law? And that is an *excellent* question, because that's pretty darn impaired. Exactly what sort of therapy or help *was* he entitled to? No answers on that front, and I wish there were. I agree with you wholeheartedly here. Julian Bashir should have had *real* help for his *real* problems. Had he been able to get that, this whole second question could have been avoided, because he probably would have ended up as average instead of as a super genius.

The second is about whether or not it's moral to punish the child for the sins of the parents. In this case, I have to disagree with your conclusion. If you only punish the parents, you run the risk that pushy parents are going to risk it anyway to give their children an edge. And if the pushy parents do it, then a great deal of non-pushy parents are going to feel they have to do it as well just so their kids can keep up! Remember, Julian's parents didn't ethically stay within the spirit of the law (if not the letter) by simply having his impairments corrected, no, they made him *special*. And that's what every other parent would end up doing if there was a loophole. You can't be honest if everybody else is cheating. The only way to ensure that people don't break the law is to make sure that if it's caught, it all comes for nothing and *everybody* involved, parents and children, gets punished - the parents by being imprisoned, the children by being locked out of the best jobs. It's unfair, but at least that method has a chance of working.

One note: We have no idea if his genetic changes are heritable. It's not unheard of for people to carry two genetic codes. There's a case of a [woman who was accused of welfare fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Fairchild) because genetic testing on her children showed they were somebody else's! It wasn't until they tested the third immediately after she gave birth that they realized her reproductive organs had a different set of chromosomes than the rest of her body. There's no reason that this might not have been done to Julian. (But was it? I have no clue.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spelling and writing are more "crystallized" than speech and take longer to change. Also, our orthography is something we are explicitly taught long after we have learned to speak.

Finally, the question you need to ask is "considered right by whom and in what context?"  Many words are roundly condemned despite being in common usage for a very long time. Consider "ain't" or the "aks" pronunciation of "ask". There is no official body to say "this is right, this is wrong". Instead, right and wrong are largely considered on the grounds of what wealthy, educated people consider to be right and wrong... which, unsurprisingly, overlaps strongly with how they perceive themselves as speaking and writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iris is pretty light skinned. Her children, especially if she marries a white guy, could easily come out looking lighter than she is. And if they continue the trend, there's no reason her grandchildren couldn't look white. And if they look white and identify as white, they effectively *are* white, race being a social construct and not any sort of science. Quite a lot of people who consider themselves white in America are walking around with black ancestors, they just don't know it. (Or they do know it and don't consider it terribly relevant, because unlike in Jim Crow days "one drop" is just not that important to us.)

At any rate, Eobard is ~16 generations removed from Eddie, not 1 or 2. (Going by the wiki, which says he's from the 25th century, and assuming 25 years between generations. That's the rule used for gathering demographic data.) </TEXT>

Even if it does shake out that way, that doesn't mean that Eobard couldn't exist. Eddie could cheat. Iris could die young, causing Eddie to remarry without divorce. Eddie could donate sperm to a friend or stranger (who happens to also be one of Eobard's ~65,500 ancestors alive today). They could have fertility issues combined with a wacky mixup at the clinic. They and Barry could form a stable poly relationship.

<TEXT>  But he's also an antisocial square, devoted to a conception of personal honor that he hasn't realized is just set dressing for a culture of political thuggery that has repeatedly spurned and assaulted him....

Putting aside your main question, I want to take a second to defend Worf here. 

I think Worf really *does* realize as an adult that Klingons do not all match up to the ideal he formed in his head as a child. The trouble is that his personality was formed as an adopted Klingon child living on a Federation colony. He didn't fit in, and he didn't fit in with Klingons, and like any child he rather simplistically decided that if he could just live up to everybody's ideals, he could fit in with everybody instead of his actual situation, which was fitting in with nobody at all. 

So he threw himself into being Worf, son of Mogh, SUPERKLINGON while simultaneously trying to be Worf Rozhenko, FEDERATION. The end result is, well, Worf the grown-up, whose idea of meshing the best of both cultures led him to be quite a serious individual. And an epic buzzkill. Even when he grew old enough and knowledgeable enough to realize that Klingon society isn't all honorable all the time (and that humans don't all live up to their vaunted ideals either, nor does any other species in the Federation or out of it), he'd put too much effort into this to easily ditch it and become somebody a little less uptight.

This is still probably a bit healthier than the path we see for other Klingons (or part-Klingons) raised primarily by humans, such as B'Elanna's approach of simply rejecting everything she perceived as "Klingon" in her personality or Alexander deciding to just randomly sign up on a Klingon ship despite being really *really* underqualified. 

Now, with that said, I can see why Worf and Jadzia would take up with each other, and even why their relationship works on a storytelling level. From Worf's perspective, Jadzia is somebody who can accept him for who he is, both Klingon and Federation. She enjoys Klingon culture on more than a superficial level, and she also appreciates Federation ideals. They have a realistic level of culture clash. I don't know that their relationship would have really lasted all that much longer if she hadn't been killed, but it's not all that uncommon for people to enter a marriage and figure out three or four years down the line that they screwed that one up, should've remained friends. Not every long-term relationship on TV has to really be forever. That's what's really unrealistic.

(Alternatively, they could have continued to try to adapt and make it work, and had they gone that route it probably would have lasted if she hadn't been killed.)

The one thing I find really unrealistic is that despite them both having been married before, neither had the common sense of a gnat. Before getting married, you should discuss all major issues like "what about vacations" and "childrearing practices?" and "budget!" (not sure if this is an issue for starfleet, but I never really believed they have no money) and, oh yeah, "what about the afterlife, are we both going to the same place or what?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a survivorship fallacy if I ever saw one. You look at the few ones we remember decades later and take them as representative. 

Additionally, who's to say that they'll last another few decades? They certainly might - once something has been in print 50 years, it'll probably be in print another 50 - but sometimes things do fall off the cultural radar. For example, although kids today certainly do know about Michael Jackson, do they know about MASH? (Source: Have two young nieces, had to endure months of Michael Jackson worship. They've since moved on to Katy Perry, which isn't really any better.) </TEXT>

There was the one where Worf's (adopted) brother was trying to save that species and Picard was initially all "can't, prime directive" about it.

<TEXT>  I agree with a lot of what you are saying, but remember that the Federation does not equate to Earth and humans only. The Vulcans are part of the Federation. 

As are the Andorians, aren't they? And now the Bajorans. A Vulcan (or Andorian, or Bajoran) colony would be one set up by those governments either pre-Federation (prior to joining the Federation for the Bajorans) or that is limited largely or entirely to those species. (Which sets up an interesting question. Can or will the Federation charter a colony that is set up to be just one species?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Deep Space Nine, during the baseball episode, we find out that the Captain's Vulcan nemesis heads an all-Vulcan ship. An all-Vulcan ship in Starfleet. In Enterprise and Voyager, viewpoint Vulcans give us an idea of how frustrating it can be to be a Vulcan surrounded by non-Vulcans.

It seems plausible to me that some species, such as humans, are more willing to be part of a mixed crew than others, such as Vulcans. Since humans aren't likely to be interested in watching a show that's 100% non-human, we see the human-dominated ships, with the human captains. There is no guarantee that this is the majority of all captains, though. 

Additionally, as much as it's possible for some species to have an easier time living with others than other species, it seems likely that some are simply more interested in space exploration for its own sake. This can be backed up by looking at the stats. The Vulcans have been flitting around the galaxy since 900 BCE, the Bajorans since the 1600s (at sublight speeds), the Klingons sometime between the 20th and 21st centuries, the Andorians since at least the 20th century. Yet the galaxy is not full up on Vulcan (pre-Federation) and Bajoran and Klingon and Andorian colonies. There are still plenty of worlds for the Federation to site colonies on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Person first language.

Okay, I get the reasoning. Sorta. I think it's really *weird*, but I get the reasoning, and more than that, I understand that a lot of people think it's always the best and most polite way to talk about PWDs. That's what they've been told, that's what they believe.

Me- and I'm not alone in this - I find it stigmatizing. You don't call somebody "A person with Asian-ness" or "A woman who happens to be beautiful" or "A man who has homosexuality". No, that sort of workaround is restricted to disabilities. 

I also think it's weird and insulting that something that is a huge and important part of who I am, more important than my gender (and people can't get through three sentences without labeling you as male or female!), should be treated like it's minor and unimportant in the name of  being "polite".

But because I am polite and have good manners, I'm not going to jump all over people who use person-first language. They mean well.

Now, is it asking so much to want them to show me the same basic respect? If somebody says that they are "an autistic individual" or "a blind dude" or "a Deaf woman" and the very first words out of your mouth are "I think you mean *person with autism*" (or whatever), you are *doing it wrong*. If they had meant that, they would have said that, and you are being *so* rude and disrespectful.

Don't do that. Don't be a jerk. Also: if you know for certain that somebody prefers this usage over that one, try to use that one! But definitely don't "correct" them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a diversity of opinions on the subject, as you might expect.

Two things to consider:

1. It is possible - I don't know this boy (I assume he's a real kid, not a character?) - that what's making his life difficult is not the autism per se but the disabling attitudes of society. (When you hang around with entirely the wrong crowd, phrases like "the disabling attitudes of society" come trippingly on the tongue as easily as "hi, how are you!")

2. The real concern about a cure is not that a cure might be available, but that it might not be *optional* - or that at *best*, it would only be optional *to the parents* and the autistic individual themselves wouldn't get a say, being cured (or not) before they can make their own medical decisions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's back up. You said, and I quote:

 Ask the majority of English speakers how many vowels English has, and they'll say 5. Just because they never took a linguistics course doesn't mean they're not wrong. 

As near as I can figure, you're saying that the *mainstream definition* - the one used by normal people who aren't speaking in academic or linguistic terms - is *wrong*, and those people who speak casually are simply *wrong*. It's not that they're using a different definition of the word (one that runs "a vowel is a member of the category of letters 'a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-y', every syllable has at least one vowel"), they're just wrong.

Which is rather akin to saying "Tomatoes and bell peppers and cucumbers aren't vegetables, they're fruits" and getting pissy when people say that in normal parlance, they're culinary vegetables.

Also, not sure where you're getting "English has 11 vowels" from. Different dialects surely differ. Is this some sort of average, or...? </TEXT>

<TEXT> DS9 didn't have credits, and latinum was used by the Ferengi and other non-Federation (or, at least, non-human) species.

Which sorta works, until you ask "but... uh... how on earth were the humans getting root beer out of Quark?" I mean, they had to have been compensating him somehow!

It may be possible for a complex society such as the Federation to operate without any form of money. It is not possible for the Federation *as written* to do that, no matter how many times they tried to shoehorn "no money in the future!" into the script.

Also, I get that they're post-scarcity, but post-scarcity doesn't mean that everything is available to everybody. If you want to eat at Sisko's Creole Kitchen, and so does everybody else, there has to be some way to determine who gets a seat and who has to wait. Post scarcity means that everybody gets food, but it doesn't mean that everybody gets Syrup of Squill during the shortage. Everybody gets a roof over their heads, but they don't all get 1,000 sq ft of prime waterfront views right in the heart of the most fashionable neighborhood. Everybody gets an education and health care, they don't all get the best teacher and doctor... and there has got to be some way to allocate who gets the most desirable things and who gets the merely functional ones. If they're not using "money" as this system, then they've done a darn poor job of explaining what they ARE using instead. </TEXT>

And yes, by all means you should go to the doctor you're comfortable with. Besides, taking up space in a clinic if you don't *need* to is unfair to the people who don't have a choice as to which doctor to visit. It's not first world problems, it's... compassion for people who hate waiting!

I have my fingers metaphorically crossed for a good test result.

 So it's hard to push own the thoughts that I'm already unlucky so of course I'll get cancer.

<TEXT> Eobard doesn't consistently have his speed back, making operations based on speed dubious at best, and this is the first rule because moving the body is suspicious behavior. You dig up the body, leaving evidence that *something* was left there. You transport it great distances - even at superspeed, somebody might notice something, and when Barry gets news that "The Flash" was seen somewhere he *knows* he wasn't, he's going to know something's up. 

Trying to hide the evidence carries the risk of leaving more evidence around.  </TEXT>

No ashes or falling down.

<TEXT>   Many don't sit down on the toilet but instead poop while standing on the toilet seat.

Just like how in the US, many don't sit but hover over it. People think it's cleaner because, you know, no butts. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of those people are simply more used to squat toilet.

  And they don't use toilet paper so instead wash their butts in the sink ala bidet.

I always did think toilet paper was a funny custom. If I get poop on my hands, I don't wipe at them with a piece of paper, I get them wet and scrub them down with hot water and soap! </TEXT>
