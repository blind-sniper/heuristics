<TEXT> Most of them I agree with, some that I wouldn't have on my top list but are still good, but there is one that I laughed at more than I've ever laughed at the show. The Big Bang Theory. Yes, it's popular, yes it has won awards. But for that mediocre bore fest to be on the same list with Breaking Bad, The Wire, etc is just laughable. The Big Bang Theory is the McDonald's of TV. </TEXT>

This season has been different, it's a little slower but I've quite enjoyed it. The acting/cast is superb and the story has a slow unraveling. 

It's intriguing and interesting each week but it's held down by expectations from it's superior first season. Let go of that and it's a really good season of tv </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I said, it's the way people go about it. People do just come on here and put an opinion that something "sucks". They aren't looking for a discussion, they just want people fuel them to support their own opinion as to make them feel right in disliking something. 

There is nothing wrong with disliking something. What I am getting at is that people on this subreddit tend to post an opinion thread that is targeting a show for being terrible that is something a lot of other people like. They don't provide criticism like you said, just that it sucks like I said. It's done so in the manner of trolling rather than discussion. The people who post that aren't looking for any opposition from people who like it but just other people who hate it. Whereas, in a discussion thread, there are both and they are discussed in depth. 

As for your Waitress analogy, that really doesn't apply. You are talking about food that is sitting in front of me and a Waitress asking if it's correct. Which I would tell them obviously. In that scenario, that would be a sort of survey taken after watching a show. Not coming on Reddit to discuss. Your analogy works more like after the meal, you go on Yelp and say the food sucks but the place has five stars and only a couple bad reviews. People are just going to skip your review and read the good ones because it is highly rated.

I agree with you that downvoting isn't the answer for an actual reasonable discussion but for an opinion that is hate fueled and looking for a one sided discussion of how much it sucks, that is deserving of a downvote. If it's not a show I care about, I personally leave it alone, but if it is one I do care for, I will respond rather than downvoting if it's an open discussion rather than trolling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not opposite though. You are mad that there is not enough negative threads. If there was an opinion that a show sucks and a majority of the people also thought that, than it would get upvoted. But if a show sucks that everyone thinks sucks, there is not much of a point to talk about it. 

So then there are shows that are popular. People come in and say it sucks which is a minority opinion and because of that, the majority is probably going to answer. 

And the majority of the time someone doesn't like a show, they create an opinion thread for anyone who doesn't like the show. It's usually not a two sided discussion but a negative hate thread. 

Let me put it this way. I wasn't a big fan of the movie Mad:Max Fury Road but /r/movies loves it (along with the majority of critics). If I went in there saying the movie sucks in my own post, it'll get bashed and downvoted to hell because it's a poor way of discussion and a minority opinion. But that's not the way of going about putting your differing opinion. I went into a Mad Max discussion thread and had good discussions back and forth about what I liked and disliked and what others thought. 

Lastly, another analogy, I quite dislike The Big Bang Theory. I'm pretty sure there might be a good portion of people on reddit who dislike it as well and some that do like it. But I'd rather talk about the shows I do like rather than bash a show that I don't care about because it's popular.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference is between a show discussion thread that has both positives and negatives and a opinion thread about how bad something is. 

It sounds like you arent looking so much for a place to "talk about tv" but a place where people can hate on tv. Sorry if we like liking things. If there is a negative opinion that gets downvoted, thats either because it was presented in a poor manner as to offend people who do like it, or they just happen to be in the minority of that opinion.

Edit: Interesting and Ironic. I'm getting downvoted for having an opposing opinion and providing criticism in this thread. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A 3 way crossover. An It's Always Sunny episode with the guys from Workaholics and the gals from Broad City. 

Adam, Blake, and Ders fly to New York City after they won a trip to see a live concert. Their plane gets landed early in Philly when Carl was caught with grass on the plane. 

They immediately go bar hoping which leads them to Paddy's. 

Meanwhile, Ilana and Abby are traveling to Philly for a wedding and decided to checkout the culture of south Philly. They run into Dee and Artemis who immediately click with these two. She brings them back to Paddy's and find that Adam, Blake, Ders, and Carl, are in a yelling match with Mac, Charlie, Dennis, and Frank. 

They then find only one way to settle the argument (you decide what that might be), a game of Chardee MacDennis. Workaholics v Paddy's v Broad City/Dee/Artemis </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, they are fantastic. I'm incredibly surprised not only have you not seen them but know pretty much nothing about them. 

Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. His Batman voice is odd but you get used to it. 

The Dark Knight has probably one of, if not "the", best portrayals of a comic book character and that is Heath Ledger's Joker.

<TEXT> I think, if the movie is as good as it looks, that it will have a very positive effect on his legacy. But, I also don't believe that his current legacy is "complicated". He is the creator of Bad Robot which has produced tons of great TV shows and movies. He is the creator of Lost, Alias, and other huge shows. He brought back the Mission Impossible franchise with 2 great movies and the same with Star Trek. All well received. And his original movies have been shrouded with secrecy that is unheard of in this day and age which people enjoy. Yea, he uses lens flares a lot but that's his thing and he likes it. As for borrowing other directors styles, most everybody does that. Even some of our favorite directors have influences of their own. But specifically calling out him borrowing from Spielberg on Super 8 is funny considering Steven Spielberg produced the movie. 

tl;dr JJ Abrams is already pretty well beloved but if Star Wars is good, his legacy will be solidified as gold. </TEXT>

You are right that as standalone movies they never really work the best but that's why they are parts. I think Harry Potter is the only one that it worked successfully so far </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it is /r/movies, and if a superhero is in a movie, than that movie can be talked about here. So can any other piece considered a movie. If you want to see more about "original films" create a topic about an individual film you enjoyed. 

Also, you are writing this while Comic-Con is going on, of course there is going to be a ton of content geared towards superheros and comic book movies this week.

And to say that superhero movies represent everything wrong with the film industry is quite a ridiculous statement. Movies were originally created to entertain, which is exactly what superhero movies do. That's not to say that's all i watch or all i talk about, but there is nothing wrong with them if they entertain me. You don't have to like them but they are very popular today and they fulfill the reason we watch movies for a lot of people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "appeals to either dimwits when barely a brain cell to rub together". That was the most dimwitted sentence I've read on reddit, was that even English? 

Freaks and Geeks is one of the most beloved Cult comedies in television. And it's comedy. Not every comedy needs to be smart comedy (which I do enjoy as well). 

Melissa McCarthy can act and chooses to do comedy which she is good at. Yes, she has been type cast and has done a few shitty movies, but she also has done good movies as well. In fact, Spy (also Paul Feig) had awful marketing that made it look like she was playing the same character that she played in her last 3 few movies. But it wasn't, she was great and the reviews were through the roof. 

And no, Bridesmaids is not a work of art, I never even came close to saying that. But it is a very well received and funny comedy that made a lot of money and a lot of people, besides you, laugh. Which is what comedy is for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still don't know how I feel about this. And it has nothing to do with the all women cast (because I am a big fan of each of them). More so, anyone putting on a Ghostbusters uniform other than Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson kinda doesn't feel right. 

But still, it's very well casted and Paul Feig is great so I'll hold judgement until I at least see a trailer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I've like Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi's iteration of The Doctor the most. Capaldi's first season wasn't the greatest story wise but his characterization was very good. Matt Smith Era had some of the best stories in my opinion. I don't even notice the special effects and that has never been nor ever will be the main focus over story for this show. That's just my 2 cents </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely think you are reading into it too much. There is some rehashing (obviously repilot) but most of what you talked about is character traits. Chang being a villain and wanting to leave that behind has been his entire arc back and forth every season. 

Paintball is a staple with Community so bringing it back was not for lack of ideas or for a callback but because it's a natural part of Greendale and the fans wanted it done right again. Same thing with Dungeons and Dragons, that was straight fan service but I loved that episode.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was still pissed at Sony about that until they announced that Spider-Man would be rebooted and joining the MCU. Now I'm finally excited to see Spider-Man again. Spider-Man 3 was bad, but that was mostly due to Sony pushing for things to be changed/added. 

I boycotted TASM movies because I thought they handled terribly (choosing to reboot the franchise while Spidey 4 was in Pre-production, rushing it into production only 5 years after the last one, choosing a director who was under qualified for the movie, and arrogantly announcing 3 sequels before the 1st one opened). 

Now, I also did like Andrew Garfield so I'll probably check them out now that I have no more reason to be pissed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am excited for any new Star Wars at this point but when the Han Solo solo movie was rumored I wasn't fond of it. But the way that The Force Awakens looks from the trailers, the casting for Rogue One, and the directors choice for this one, I'm now bumped up to cautiously optimistic. No matter what, I'll still see it, but it really depends on who they cast if I'm going to be fully on board. I think they need to get someone who fits the role like Harrison Ford rather than getting someone who does a Harrison Ford impression.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really enjoyed it. I had never seen a Terminator movie until a few weeks ago when I started to watch all of them so coming fresh off the other movies and with an objective opinion on the franchise, I liked it. It wasnt perfect but it was a great sequel to T2 (which it seemed to be as it retconned Rise of the Machines and Salvation)

Kyle Reese was miscast but Jai Courtney did a fine job. I loved Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor and Jason Clarke as John Connor. 

Arnold was awesome, got the humor and a little heart well (old. Not obsolete). 

The story was convoluted but it all made sense to me. My brother had only seen T2 and Salvation and he followed it perfectly fine. It was an entertaining action movie </TEXT>

I didn't say that the 2nd island isn't believable. I meant that they after the park was disserted and all of the dinos were brought to the factory island, they shouldn't have just been left there to thrive. They probably should have been put down. 

I don't get what you mean by the parasailing being shoehorned in but it doesn't matter, none of these bother me at all, I'm simply stating that most everything in these movies is due to human error as is JW.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> T1 was a very slow paced movie, they kept it simple because there was low budget (probably to their favor), and had Kyle Reese hand holding Sarah pretty much the entire movie. T2 had less of that, which you are right, but that's why its the best in the franchise and highly regarded.

Even though i also didnt think it was perfect, it was entertaining and followed the story of the first two well. I thought Arnold was great and Sarah and John both had great screen presence. I thought Jai Courtney did a fine job but i agree he was definitely miscast as Kyle. The writing was fine to me and i enjoyed and followed the plot easily. The score i didnt notice much but it seemed fine. Much better than the 80's electro score of the first two.

I only brought up the film noir point because you said it was insulting to called this "Terminator" and compared it to "shitty Marvel movie" implying that you don't seem to like current popular blockbusters and seem to feel that Terminator is of an entirely different breed. And i have heard others go to the point of thinking T2 is perfection in cinema, which im in agreement with you. So i apologize for assuming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact is, John Connor ends up getting caught and turned into a terminator. So Sarah doesn't want to fall in love with Kyle because he is supposed to die and it would create John (who yes, is the savior but also the eventual downfall of the human race as far as they know). Then you have John trying to kill Kyle, his father. Except, it's not actually John anymore and the timeline where Kyle is his father doesn't exist anymore. John only exists as a terminator now. Therefore it doesn't matter if he kills him and he has the mentality of Skynet so he does want to kill. 

You are right, it isn't fully explained but I was able to sniff that out. The only explanation given still works. John is now a terminator and his mission is to kill Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor to prevent the Resistance from ever happening. Meaning the Terminator John no longer cares of his existence because his existence means the end of Skynet which is his allegiance.  </TEXT>

For me it was How I Met Your Mother. Killing the mom ruined any potential rewatch of an episode or the series. Now watching the comedy show is just a downer because you know that every story old Ted is telling is a sad story about how he met his wife and she died. If it were a drama, that would be a fitting ending. Or if there wasn't the narrative that it is all stories being told from the perspective of a future Ted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Either way, the radio/intercom system was disrupted so it would have been the result. Even so, if it did escape then, it would have found a way when they were to move it for the attraction or some other way because it is adaptive and intelligent. 

Also, you could say the same about a lot of things in the Jurassic Park franchise. 

1. If the kids would have never turned on the light, the T-Rex may have never found them and the whole chain of events after may not have happened. 

2. If Hammond didn't decide to let the animals live on the 2nd island (even though they were supposed to die naturally), the whole 2nd movie wouldn't exist. 

3. If the kid and his step dad didn't go parasailing in a no fly zone, the entire 3rd movie wouldn't exist. 

I don't believe any of those because  a little suspension of disbelief is required for movies about dinosaurs in Modern times. Especially when it deals with human characters making mistakes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that Jai Courtney was a bad choice for Kyle Reese (but he still did a good job) but I thought Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke were great. 

The writing was not bad. No worse than any of the others. Even though the Terminator and T2 were great movies, they both had some cheesy jokes and lines as did this movie. 

Yes, the spoilers in the trailer bothered me too. And it does have a ton of CGI but that doesn't bother me because it's a Hollywood action movie. As were all of the other ones. Let's not pretend that the other movies are film noir just because they were ahead of their time and superior. 

The characters achieved killing Skynet which is pretty much the goal of every movie. Kyle Reese grew from a soldier with no hope on a mission to save Sarah Connor to a vulnerable human who may have a future and is being saved by Sarah and what he believes is his enemy. Sarah grew from being a scared orphaned child, to a hard young woman, and then to open up to Kyle. 

Even if you don't like the movie or the action, there was plenty of real risk of danger. Every moment they were in danger. I felt that John Connor as a villain was finally a step up from the T1000. He was harder to fight and kill. 

It's nowhere near innovative or as good as T2 but it's a solid sequel to a action franchise. It was entertaining.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We never actually saw a working Skynet headquarters other than in Salvation. The terminators are a product of Skynet which is the main software. So it having a "face and name" is logical to control everything. It could have been text too but it's easier for the audience. 

Yes, it was a T800 but it was also the first T800 and John had already fought more advanced ones. They learned each time and became more advanced. And is not as if the T-800 ever took a beating or got beat. Also, that was only the first attempt to catch John Connor. All of the other attempts are technically in Skynet's future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the terminator franchise ARE action movies. And this one brought something new to the franchise that we had not seen in the terminator movies. Post Apocalyptic war. 

Skynet did not have a face and the voice was only the computer. If you watch it, it stated that it made a face that would be easier for Marcus to deal with. It was still just the computer system. 

As for Skynet making mistakes, you  need to realize that first of all, most movies don't kill main characters. 2nd, it is early in the timeline and the terminators weren't as advanced as in the rest of the movies because they are from the future. 

I guess I just see your examples as nitpicky for a action movie franchise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because again, it's not being judged on its own but against season 1. They aren't doing the same thing as last season so automatically people compare two very different seasons. Season 1 hit it hard in the beginning, maybe season 2 plays slower and slowly more and more begins to be revealed. Maybe it does end up not as good, none of us know because we've only seen two episodes. 

Plus, no one had another epic season of True Detective to compare to when season 1 aired. Now it has left unreal expectations for most.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right but what I meant is that I and many others believe the Nielsen system is flawed. It takes a sample audience to measure their numbers. Not only that, it's not a random audience, you have to be a picked as a "Nielsen Family" for which no one knows their algorithm. So it's the same people every time. For example, the Big Bang Theory gets 15 to 20 mil people each week. I don't doubt that a ton of people watch that show but I think that maybe of their "sample audience", they picked more people who would typically watch a show like that rather than venture out and watch something that is supposedly low rated like Parks and Recreation. 

From what Dan Harmon has said about Community's season on Yahoo, he has said way more people were watching than what the Nielsen numbers showed. But we also haven't seen data so who knows.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Harry's cloak and the elder wand have been featured since the first book/movie. It's also mentioned that invisibility cloaks are very rare and ones that don't eventually fade are unheard of. The Elder Wand has been under possession of Dumbledore without us really knowing but it's the most powerful wand ever made. But it's been there. The stone first showed up when the ring did in HBP. And the story of the Deathly Hallows was part of the lore but just unheard by the audience until the final book. 

All 3 make the Deathly Hallows and the most powerful wizard if together. To have 2 of them in such close range and under our noses the entire time was amazing to me. And they are two things that helped both Harry and Dumbledore do things others could not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And the ministry of magic wasn't? They don't care. They are reckless. 

LotR is battles for most of the movies and books whereas it only happens twice in Potter. They wouldn't make much sense without it. Braveheart is one single movie so that's a terrible comparison. 

Deathly Hallows Part 2 was pretty much all battle. It was happening even when we don't see it but we do see quite a lot of it.

The movies made a point that the battles aren't the most important thing, and I agree with that. You clearly don't but why are the battles so important? The first one is redundant with the much larger one looming and the second doesn't have much to do with the plot line other than that it is happening and people we love are dying, which we do see.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It focuses on it as much as Sorcerer's stone Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Order of the Phoenix. It's the beginning of that storyline. The entire movie doesn't focus on it but a decent portion is spent on it.

Yes, the battle was protecting the castle. So was the battle of Hogwarts. It gave more to the final battle not showing it. Snape is a Death Eater. And no one knew that it would be Snape to finally kill him except Dumbledore. The death eaters notoriously travel in packs. If anything, they were there to make sure Draco didn't mess up and to actually see Dumbledore die. Even in the book, there was no guarantee of a battle. It's not as if the Death Eaters came just because they knew a battle would happen. By that logic, there should have been a battle in GOF and OotP.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The plot is about trying to figure out what/where the Horcruxes are. And it's Harry's last normal year at Hogwarts. It has heart, humor, and everything I love about HP. 

Draco has a great arc. It's his internal struggle. And the Death Eaters get in to finish Draco's task (kill Dumbledore) which is a massive task and they do succeed. The reason there was no battle is not because of time nor because the director hates battles. It was because he felt it would give more build up to the final battle for which if it was in HBP, the battle of Hogwarts would just feel like another battle rather than THE battle. 

The reveal of HBP is lackluster yes. It's not really meant to be a giant reveal, just more so another thing to make us wonder where Snape lies and how that conflicts Harry. 

As I said before, it's my favorite because it has everything I love about Harry Potter and it's intriguing as hell. Less action sure, but much more backstory (even more in the book).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never saw the other movies and although I didn't hate the movie, I also didn't think it was great either. Entertaining for sure, but not much more than that for me.

Cinematography was great and I loved the cast. But it was, as you said, a two hour long car chase. It became repetitive. It didn't have a lot of plot or character development. I felt nothing for any of the characters other than Furiosa. Even when Immortan Joe died I didn't really care. I should have been excited but I never really felt like he was a real threat. 

It had its moments but was not perfect for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was the major thing that took me out of the movie. I could believe  everything else happening within this world but that character just was too far fetched and cheesy for me. 

I get that armies used to have battle music and this is supposed to be an homage to that but still it doesn't work. In a World where everything is decrepit and scarce, they somehow have an electric guitar/flamethrower with tons of amps and drummer's on the back. 

Not only that, but they have people who are specifically doing that rather than fighting in this brutal age. And they weren't "going to war"  and having the typical standoff that traditionally had battle music, but were quickly chasing after an attempted escape. BUT they had enough time to gear up the guitar rig?

Of everything that is out there in this movie, this was the one thing that I just couldn't make sense of, even within this world.

Edit: Also, I'm a guitar player who likes rock music, so of anyone, this should have resonated with me but it just took me out of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to disagree. Other platforms may have a very slightly smoother interface for some apps. But on the whole, no other platform can do a lot of the things we can do on Android. 

As far as I see it, when I first got a touchscreen phone, I had two options. An sleek and fast iPhone that was limited or a slower buggy Android that had full customization. I chose Android because of the customization and since then, Android mostly caught up on the sleekness and fastness of Apple but Apple never caught up on other things. They have only tried to mimic a few things from Android.

I love android and wouldn't trade it for any other platform. Not due to my loyalty, but still at its current state, it is overall better for my use.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The storyline IS absurd. It's a park with real dinosaurs open to the public. And they created a Hybrid to attract more customers. That is also a very meta commentary on real life with people's attention spans today and always wanting bigger and better and not impressed by anything (kinda like you with this movie). 

You are mostly right about the characters. I don't think they are one dimensional but they don't quite compare to the original. But that's because the characters in the original are the smartest in their field and brought there because of their knowledge. 

And yes, many scenes stick in my mind. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say them. 

Also, you say there are plot holes but didn't mention a single one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't want the book series as a TV show. It's too expensive to create. I know they do it with Game of Thrones but that's because most of the scope is real locations and effects are minimal (usually one or two big sequences per season) whereas Potter has grand locations, Grand set pieces, and a lot of effects. 

However, there was a fake trailer for a TV series a few years ago titled "Aurors" which I would absolutely love to see. But again, it would either be insanely expensive or look cheap </TEXT>

<TEXT> You got that right about Shirley and Pierce, haha. Troy also was my favorite character but I guess the amazing episodes that followed his departure made me forget a little. 

I personally love how Frankie fit into the group. She found her own place and kind of took a leadership role. But still found herself trying to please the group with things their friends who left might do. 

Elroy also was great because throughout the entire season he had one foot in the study group and one out and also understood that. They never hid that or tried to make it something it wasn't. He had some really great moments and even though he was reluctant to be in the group, they treating him as an equal and fit in. 

It can be different but have the same feel and writing. The group dynamic changes as does storylines, characters, etc. But Greendale is still there, the cast from the other seasons, and most importantly the writing and Dan Harmon's sense of humor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, the reason I loved it is because the show grew. It still held onto enough of what we love about the show but it was forced to makes changes with cast members leaving and, as much as I love the original cast, it is what the show needed. 

The first couple episodes were a little tough to get into but once Frankie and Elroy added to the group dynamic, it really worked. I found a ton of episodes to have the classic Community heart, meta humor, references, and originality. 

To me, it seems most people who didn't like Season 6 is because they are still subconsciously hoping for a glory days greatest hits of old Community but can't grasp that the show has changed and is still Community at its core, just a little different. 

I really enjoyed season 6 and also think season 5 is my 2nd favorite season of the series.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is some truth to what you say about weight but I think they did a great job making it the most realistic they can. I too love Jurassic Park, but like I said to someone else on here, the effects impress us because we still think in that time while watching it and the memory of being impressed. If Jurassic Park came out today for the first time with the same effects, it would sadly be criticized for lack of realism. 

Lastly, I am a huge fan of all of the JP movies. I was 3 when the first one came out and it was probably the first movie I ever saw. I also have seen it and the sequels over 30 times. I was very impressed by this movie and pleased as a fan, not just as a mass audience member.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is a mindset, it didn't feel real to you because you wouldn't let it. You wanted Animatronic and got CGI so you never let it have a chance. Also, maybe it's just your wording but Cinematography has nothing to do with CGI.

As for JP, that felt real back then because it was new technology and was the first of its kind. And now it still has that feeling due to memory of having seen it. As much as I love that film, if it came out today with the same effects, it would be shit on for feeling fake. The only reason to have Animatronic I-Rex would have been nostalgia.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's the CGI, I think you have to look at the inner dialogue of the movie that people going to the park are used to dinosaurs now and that people want better, more scary, bigger dinosaurs because the old ones are "been there, done that". It's a very meta meaning because it's true with Jurassic Park movie goers. Since the original in 93 which was the first movie to really do dinosaurs right and feel real and scary interacting with humans, there have been 2 sequels and countless other dinosaur and dinosaur inspired movies to come out. It feels like an old hat and it doesn't phase you. An animatronic I-Rex would not have made it more scary or real for you. In fact, if they would have done that, it would probably feel more fake but make a few of the JP fanboys happy. And all 4 movies did have a mix of practical and CGI, number 4 just happened to use mostly CGI because it fits they action they wanted to accomplish and the detail they wanted to have in the I-Rex </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually thought it was great. The cameos were plentiful for sure but most never took up more time than needed. I liked Ronda Rousey (although you are right, she is not great at acting). For me, I always loved the characters but the last few seasons missed what I personally loved about the show, the behind the scenes of getting a movie made. This movie brought that back and I really enjoyed it more than seasons 6-8. Yea, it didn't have a whole lot of heart but what it did was well done (Johnny's arc in particular). The connection of Vince's troubles is shown slightly in the Piers Morgan show but it doesn't weigh on that because there is not enough time. That would only fit in in the series and if it were in the movie, it would have been even more "crammed" as you said. This movie is a glimpse into the end stages of a movie and being that we know the characters and can't follow the entire production, we are caught up pretty well. 

I never felt that it was to crammed or half assed but that's just my opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love the show but every season so far I've gotten like 3 episodes behind and just end up binging the rest of the season once it's all done. It's well acted and intriguing but falls by the wayside in favor of other shows until I have time. This season I even told myself I wouldn't let it happen... But it did.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> By that logic, NBC owed us a proper ending. And we don't "deserve" anything. We are incredibly lucky to have had 6 seasons of this show that could have been canceled after 1 season. It's very arrogant for us fans to say they owe us and we deserve this. Yahoo gave us a season 6, they did not need it. They have a well received concert series and could bought any other recently cancelled show that has a following. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this show. It's one of my favorite shows of all time and I've been with it since the pilot aired. We lived through Cancelation threats, hiatuses, major staff changes, character departures, actual Cancelation and renewal once again. Throughout all of this Community defied all odds and was consistently great (besides season 4 of which we know why). And we beat Cancelation... We won. We got 6 seasons of this incredible show. That should be enough for us fans especially considering the continuous quality that is difficult to maintain for most long running shows. 

Having said that, I will definitely watch it if there is more but I am finally ok with it ending.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a perfect finale but I thought it was good. I enjoyed it as an episode. Anyway, watch Season 7 of Curb Your Enthusiasm if you want to get a partially new episode of Seinfeld. The storyline is that Larry David (starring in Curb as fictionalized version of himself/creator of Seinfeld) decides to do a Seinfeld reunion episode. The entire season has all of the meetings with the cast and crew, table reads, writing, dress rehearsals, and footage of the "reunion episode". It's pretty cool </TEXT>

Also, no offense, but the season 5 episode with Paget Brewster aired over a year ago and the episode referenced in season 6 was a couple months ago now. With how quick some Community fans are, it's safe to assume that anything found months after the episode would have been posted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your description of what you wanted for a finale is exactly what happened. "The future will be uncertain, but we'll keep in touch and get through it together with the community we built". That explains exactly what happened. You only see it as a lazy writer deal because you personally know that they purposefully left it open. But you take that out of it and it is a well written finale that yes, has a opening for more, but also serves as a very good series finale and is Community at its best. Hilarious, sad, thought provoking, incredibly meta, and when you get down to it, about the characters. 

As for the potential comment, I see what you mean now. I thought you meant the entire series initially. But I also disagree with you that seasons 5 and 6 were anything less than strong even though we have lost great characters. But that's just our differing opinions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The finales that wrap everything up are the most unrealistic and worst finales. It was meant to feel teasing for the viewer and for the characters. The uncertainty of the end is what made us fans a Community and now it's the thing that they end on. That's amazing to me. I think this was a very good season (not lackluster) and to say the show never realized it's full potential is unreal. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen. 

And you say you don't like that the end did not fully wrap everything up but you want more?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started watching when the pilot aired. I started watching the show because Chevy Chase was back on TV but I stayed for all of the characters and the witty writing. I knew right away that I liked the show and as the first season went along, it started to show signs of the amazing writing of Dan Harmon and crew. The first episode that led up to Paintball was the Chicken Fingers episode. That was the first true concept ep. When paintball came, by that point I was in love with the show. I knew it was coming from the promos but until I actually saw it, I had no idea how good it would be and in that way, it blew me away. 

I only joined Reddit a year ago so I was kind of on an island for awhile since no one I knew watched it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Due to low ratings on NBC, the creator/showrunner Dan Harmon and Chris McKenna were fired. They hired two others who tried their best with the writers and cast to replicate Community but what we got was a empty shell. It looked like Community and sometimes felt like it, but mostly it was just trying too hard to be Community.

Dan and Chris were hired back for season 5 and 6 and it is very noticeable. Seasons 5 and 6 are great. You could skip 4 but id say just stick it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want the glory days, rewatch the other seasons. This season, although not the best season, really was excellent and still had the Community humor I love. It's not supposed to leave you with the "Good Ol Times" feeling. The show changed, it went through many major changes and dealt with them in the most Community way. If you don't like it, fine. But to say it's "not Community" is way off base. 

And I never found Elroy or Frankie to be that much quirkier than the rest of the group nor were they forced. They fell naturally into the group and they didn't spend too much time focused on their characters. Yet they developed them slowly throughout the season </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a thing called the Internet. And, although I starting watching when the pilot first aired, I survived 4 and a half seasons before joining Reddit. Since joining, there has rarely been a moment of the show that I missed a joke or reference. I've seen the Harmontown movie but never listened to the podcast. I have however read many many articles and follow his rants on social media. Which all will exist after the fact.

I think future Community fans will be fine. Sure, they won't quite have the huge moments of joy (renewals and new instant classic episodes) and low points (delays, Cancelation threats, Dan and Chris fired, actual cancelation) but that history exists on the Internet. And anyone who finds this show and loves it, will search out the story behind it </TEXT>

I understand where you are coming from. And to be very technically correct, you are right. But prequel is a modern term used for all movies these days and by that definition, Phantom Menace is a prequel not a sequel. I don't care that much, I only said it because I made one comment about a chronological 4th movie and you came at me about it not being a sequel. I know that. That is obvious. 

As for my original post, I'm not saying it is a good joke, clearly because people are downvoting me for it, but nevertheless was my intention and I think that was clear to most people that I didn't actually think it's a sequel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You clearly never watched the show then. Yes, the show does include the party lifestyle of a good looking Hollywood actor and his buddies. But to generalize that as the entirety of the show is moronic. Especially not having seen it. You also need to keep it mind it's a comedy show with drama interwoven. Not just a drama show. 

Let me put it this way, I think The Big Bang Theory is the worst show on television, but I had the sense and respect enough to watch episodes of it here and there to gauge my opinion on the show. I go in with an open mind and come out still not liking it, but at least I give it an honest shot.  </TEXT>

The end of the episode would be Mac busting into Paddy's yelling "Guys Guys Guys! I've got news!" cut to black and it does the usually title card (12PM. On a Tuesday. It's Always Sunny...) all while Mac and the Gang are talking about the next plan. I like to imagine the Gang just continues their schemes after we leave them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always thought that PoA is my least favorite book, least favorite movie, but it is the best directed and has the perfect look of the series that set the tone for the rest of the series. The gripe about one little thing is ridiculous to claim against the director saying he is the worst. If you think he did a poor job directing, than that's fine. But one small continuity error that has nothing to do with the story and really holds no ground within the context does not make him a bad director. If anything, that should have been caught by the props department, continuity assistants, producers, and lastly the director.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" was a textbook in the Harry Potter universe written by "Newt Scamander". 

In 2007, JK Rowling wrote a small version of the textbook for Charity and then due to popular demand, released it to the public.

A few years ago she had a discussion with Warner Brothers and the idea was brought up about adapting the story of the fictional author Newt Scamander into a screenplay to make movie. JK Rowling wrote the screenplay and they are turning a fictional textbook character into a movie franchise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I said, I know all of the profit doesn't go straight to the studio, but the percentage is different for each film as is the funding for each film. Warners could have only done distribution and not put a dime into the production of the film, they could have paid for all of it, we don't know. The way the profit is split depends on how much money was put in by which company. When a Studio gets half, that most likely means they only paid half, maybe more maybe less. So as far as Warners making money, we don't know. The movie itself, made money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The movie was distributed by Warner Brothers and had 4 other production companies that made the film. We have no idea how or who exactly funded what portions of the film besides the 100 mil in marketing. Even a giant studio like Warners takes in outside investors to fund movies. The split of the take of a movie is only estimated based on basic knowledge of movie gross revenue split. The fact remains that it cost $280 to make and made $370. That's considered a success or at least moderate intake. Not even close to a "bomb". 

The rename has not been specifically stated that it was in hopes to get better home video sales, that's just speculation. The truth is that they already thought "All You Need is Kill" was too heavy with the word Kill in it. They used Edge of Tomorrow but thought it was too stock and finally ended up with a mess of a title in "Live. Die. Repeat:Edge of Tomorrow". If anything, that would decrease sales for people trying to find the movie Edge of Tomorrow.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It did $370 mil worldwide in the box office on a $180 mil budget. It was successful. The problem is the studio never liked the title "Edge of Tomorrow" as they thought it was too generic. They added the slogan on Theatrical promotional materials "Live. Die. Repeat." By the time it was released on DVD and Blu-ray, "Live. Die. Repeat." was larger than "Edge of Tomorrow" and Live. Die. Repeat. had taken over as a main title. Confusing as hell and just plain stupid </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well said. Thanks for clarifying. As you know, we all are incredibly passionate and protective of Community. Next time, just provide a little bit of context and we all love discussing different aspects of the show. But really, I hope you can move on and watch 4, 5, and 6. Nothing will ever beat season 2 for me personally but I truly think season 5 is very close and it has some of my favorite episodes of the series. 6 has been really good too. All else fails, watch them, and if you don't like them, never watch them again. It won't ruin 1-3 for you. 

Good luck and I apologize for the rudeness before context was given.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OotP was rushed at times, I'll give you that. But the tone of HBP goes along with the story, for the most part, it has its lighthearted moments as it is the last year for Harry at Hogwarts but then it gets serious again. Even though that book and movie have the most changes, they are both my favorite book and favorite movie. 

As for DH1, the point of the slow middle is to make it feel that a good portion of time is passing by. I didn't even realize that was the reason until re-reading the book. Otherwise months seem like days in the movie. And it's the calm before the storm. DH2 feels rushed because there is so much that happens, yet it's only the last quarter of the book. It is meant to feel like things are all happening at once to show chaos. You watch those two together and they provide one of the best adaptions of a book I've ever seen. 

As for the visuals, as I said in another post, that has to do with the Cinematographer, not the director.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are a sponsor of the show, it happens all the time. Subway is the biggest one, popping up for funny spotlights in Chuck, Pawn Stars, etc. The difference is that I've never seen another example of building story around advertisers other than Community with Subway and now Honda. Dan knows they need advertisers and product placement to survive so like I said, he shines a light on it and makes a story out of it. It's either that or they have to shamefully and awkwardly put their products in multiple episodes and mention them. You make that part of the story and it's hilarious </TEXT>

The difference is, instead of just showing a Honda or bringing it up casually, Dan Harmon likes to make a story out of it like he did with Subway. There is no need for it but of you have to do it, why not blow it up and shine a light on it and make it into a hilarious storyline?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The third movie was the first to have a darker palette. They tried to keep that continuity throughout the end of the series, sometimes definitely too much. But the dark color palette again isnt chosen by the director. Yes, he oversees but overall he lays that to the cinematographer as that is their job not the director. Yates isnt the greatest director ever but he is very solid and made some really good Potter movies. He is used to the universe and will bring the feel of that to Fantastic Beasts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ya know, we are only unwelcoming and awful when someone comes in and puts up a cryptic post that says "Did anyone else stop after season 3? I did. And i think i'm happy with that." From my perspective, that shows a lack of respect for the show past season 3 and a lack of respect for the people that still watch it. Your topic and first comment made it seem as if you were against the show as it is now.

As for the rest, you are very confusing on what you've seen, will not see, where you started, left off. First you say that you stopped after season 3. Then you said you stopped in the middle of season 3 due to "network changes and Harmon normalizing". Then you said you only started in the middle of season 3 and didn't have a chance since then to continue watching (all seasons are on Hulu and DVD and season 6 is on Yahoo Screen for free). Then you said you saw a few episodes of season 4. I am very confused.

EDIT: We actually are a friendly and welcoming subreddit but very protective when someone seemingly comes to troll (I now know you arent but it seemed that way). Anyway, just watch 4, 5,   6. You will struggle through 4 but will be rewarded with 5 and 6. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you were too obsessed, you would have kept watching. The thing you must know is that Dan Harmon never "normalized" anything due to the network pressure. In fact, he was fired for his push back and doing what he wanted. Then season 4 was not good without him so they brought him back for a great season 5 and 6. The cast changes are tough but it's still great. 

What you are saying is like having a kid and loving it so much and as its growing up and is influenced by the outside world, you kicked it out on the street and left it for dead only for that kid to thrive without you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other than Alfonso Cuaron, he did the best job directing. You do realize scenes being added/changed/removed is mostly who wrote and produced the movie who is Steve Kloves who wrote the screenplay for every movie but OotP and David Heyman who produced all of the movies and is producing Fantastic Beasts. I mean, David Yates had influence on how he wanted the movie made and was able to remove scenes filmed in editing but he does not typically choose what is included and excluded in the script.

As for the tone and pace of his movies, i think they were very well done. Alfonso set the tone in the third movie and David Yates brought that back in OotP. Pacing wise, his movies move swiftly except when trying to show time within the universe passing by (Deathly Hallows Part 1) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are sort of right about the characters but I wouldn't go as far as saying one trick ponies and definitely not caricatures (like Season 4). The character development happens here and there but it's definitely not the focus as in seasons 1 and 2. And that's really hard to do when you only have 13 episodes as opposed to 22-24

But season 5 and 6 are well beyond season 4. The writing is so much better and the stories are much more Community. Season 5 had some of my favorite episodes of the series.

Give season 6 another chance, you'll see from people's reviews that Community fans are loving it. Yes, it's different. That's mainly due to 3 main characters being gone. It's hard but the new characters turn out really good. It's never going to be the same as the early seasons, but the best part of Community is that they don't try to be like early days. The have evolved with the changes and still managed to hold on to what we love about the show.  </TEXT>

No matter what or how many movies I list, it's just gonna piss off Mad Max fans to no end because i didn't think it was a masterpiece.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw an Advanced Screening last week. If you are a fan of the series, you will like it, as I did. It's not a perfect movie but is a very fun return of the characters with a solid story, great cameos, and the return of my favorite part of Entourage, the behind the scenes of making movies. I loved seasons 1-5 and the rest were alright mainly for the characters. But go see the movie. It's good </TEXT>

Now, as I grew up, I started to understand the flaws and people's gripes but overall, it's still an enjoyable film. It's the worst of the series but still a good flick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm cautiously optimistic about it. It's got a great cast, the writers wrote a really funny movie in Horrible Bosses. I've been wanting another Vacation movie for years, but it is yet to be seen if it can stand on its own without Clark as the lead (even though Chevy and Beverly are in it). The trailer looks pretty funny but the connection seems loose to the original series, that could be a good thing though too. We'll see. I'll definitely be there opening weekend though </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes it felt like an extended episode but it was very much in a movie format. It worked. It never felt long and was very pleasing to a fan. 

I never saw Sex in the City but Entourage on the surface has the similarities (group of people getting  laid) but also, there was some really good story in the early seasons. Anyone who gives this analogy I like to point out season 5 because Vince's career took a dump and he had to be brought back to life and then truly fought for his career.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, seasons 6-8 got away from what made the show great. The behind the scenes of making movies in Hollywood. We didn't see Vince make any of the movies and barely got any of the promo afterwards, it was all of the dramatic side stories that took over. Still fun to watch but not as engaging as the first 5 seasons </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you'll be ok, but it wouldn't hurt to watch at least the last couple episodes. The last few seasons definitely lacked in quality compared to the first 5 but they are still fine to watch. 

If anything, just look up descriptions of the episodes to get the overall storylines </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got out of an Advanced Screening of Entourage and it was really good. I know it's been cool to hate on Entourage lately and some people just don't like it, but Seasons 1-5 for me were really good. 

Anyway, the movie was well done. It had its cheesy moments and skipped over a couple storylines from the end of the show but mostly it brought back what I loved about the show, the comical but sometimes real portrayal of the behind the scenes of making movies in Hollywood. 

It's not a perfect movie, but hell if I wasn't entertained and really loved seeing the characters again.

If you genuinely didn't like the show, no need to comment here, just move on.  </TEXT>

Also, I don't think anyone has given up on Community, It's more so that we won! We were on the brink of cancellation so many times until we finally did get canceled, then brought back to life for a very well received and reviewed season 6.

<TEXT> I don't have a problem with the action sequences. They were entertaining just not revolutionary like some people have suggested. Nothing about the way they were filmed was particularly new. It was mostly the content of the action that people enjoyed. There have been many movies that, besides the content of the scene, have been filmed/edited similarly. My problem was the content itself. It was very repetitive and took up most of the movie leaving little room for me to even care about what the story is, who these characters are, what the history of this world is. Again, I was entertained, but it wasn't anything more than that for me.  </TEXT>

The cast was great, the Cinematography was great, the action sequences were far too many but decent, the plot was lacking, and mostly it was just plain weird.

<TEXT> So, this subreddit has been gushing over Mad Max: Fury Road and I don't have a problem with that. The reviews back you all up. But for us who have never seen the other movies and are on the fence about seeing it, please convince us why we should see this movie this weekend. Personally, i like Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron but the trailer made it seem over the top and lacking in plot detail.

I know I'm not the only one in this boat, so here is your chance to change our minds. If you don't care, then just move along.

If you have seen it already, please hold on the spoilers. Thanks,

EDIT: Well, that was quick. Thanks for the responses, you have effectively swayed me to give it a chance. Keep the discussion going though for others like myself. Thank you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are 3 kinds at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Frozen which, as someone else said is like a slushy. Cold which is similar to a Cream soda with Butterscotch, vanilla, and a creamy foam topping. Both of those are tasty and sweet but the best is the third kind, most recent addition, and closest to the book. Warm/Hot Butterbeer. It's delicious and comforting. Hints of vanilla and Butterscotch. It's creamy with the consistency of hot chocolate. It's like the best warm beverage you'll ever have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> GPS speed tracking is fairly accurate when you are in a car on a highway but in a metro area it's not. Not to mention, it's only "fairly" accurate therefore not exact enough to enforce. Then the app would need to save the speed and have some way of proof that that was the speed at that time. Then the app would need to recognize where you are for the specific Speed Limit (which I don't believe exists yet). Then it would need to have access to employee records for the public transportation, employee schedules, routes. None of which is legally available to the public. Even if all of that came together, it would be expensive to build, highly illegal, and have no way of enforcement due to it being a unreliable, non-government issued app that anyone can use to try to get a driver a ticket or worse, lose their job.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hence the words "Modern Media" in my other post. Since those days of pure Parodies have come the Scary Movies, Not Another Teen Movie, etc. Times have changed and parody, for the most part, seems to come along with a negative connotation or disrespect of the source material today. That's not always the case but is quite a bit and in the case of The Big Bang Theory, their style of parody is with lack of respect to the source material. Usually Community goes along with Homage rather than Parody. Some people, including Community fans don't notice the difference, which is not a big deal, but there is a difference </TEXT>

<TEXT> Parody is simply making fun of something by way of Imitation. In Modern media it is usually used with disrespect towards something. 

Homage is respecting something through Imitation or reference. In comedy, it is used to reference something in respect while also poking fun at it. 

EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted when I explained the definition of Parody and Homage and how they are typically used in comedy today.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People who watch the Big Bang Theory aren't dumb (well, of the 20 million that supposedly watch weekly, there probably are some.) but the show is standardized comedy that goes for the cheap laugh every time. There is such a thing as Dumb Comedies being really funny, Big Bang Theory is not one of them (at least for me). 

Community is Advanced Comedy. It's not for everyone because you need to understand the show and it's references and humor. It's smart in the sense of comedy, not actual intelligence. 

I know a lot of actually smart individuals who watch the Big Bang Theory and think it's God's gift to comedy. I completely disagree with them, but they just want to watch something that they don't have to think and that one has a ton of promotion and a ton of viewers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure where it came from but the best back up to this quote is how each show handled Dungeons and Dragons. 

Community: Two full 22 minute episodes dedicated to the game showing how it works and making fun while respecting the source material. All the while having an underlying theme/reason for playing that serves a purpose to further character development. 
 
The Big Bang Theory: A 20 sec gag of the nerdy characters playing it and the girl makes fun of them because it sounds like nerdy gibberish. Makes the characters look weird for playing it and moves on with an unrelated storyline. 

I don't even play D D but which one shows more respect, heart, and was funnier? Community.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> An educated discussion about hockey was not called for when he said "I must not watch much hockey" and that I'm a "shitty fan". My response was warranted. Im also a former player, which I assume most of us are on here. You know what really made us look Dumb? Losing. The chanting is the crowd trying, clearly unsuccessfully, to get something going. Again, I'm not a huge fan of the "goalie name" chant and I didn't even participate in it because like you said, it won't work on Crawford. But I understand the reasoning behind it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. As i said, its meant to get in his head and make him screw up. It clearly didnt work tonight. But chants aren't only meant for after a goal or when we are winning. We need to keep the crowd active, support our team, and get it rowdy to distract the opposite team. Im honestly not a big "Goalie name chant" fan anyway, but that is the reason for the chant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never boo my team but the "CRAAAAAAWFOOORD" chant is meant to psych the goalie out and get into his head. He did play a great game, sadly, but the chant isnt saying "You suck" its saying "Screw up". Now, if we started the "Sieve" chant...then you would have a major point.

There is a similar chant in College hockey that DOES mean "you suck". That would go "Craaawford...Craaawford....Craaawford...SUCKS!". I think that is what you are thinking of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Sam Jackson and Gazelle did not have phones with the SIM card that creates aggression. Nor were they close to any of them, therefore it wouldn't affect them. The chip was explained to people getting one put in them that it was to not get affected but really they were control chips.

2. He got the chips to explode because he knew they could be set off (as it did with Mark Hamill's character). Again, the chips were truly meant for control. Not sure what the full potential of them were as we never got that far in the movie but he could use them to Kill someone that betrays him.

3. Eggsy was in the military and learned combat from there, the rest came from the Kingsman training which took place over months (we only saw portions of it but you'll notice the amount of time passing be Eggsy's hair length). 

4. Roxy was clearly not quite as good as Eggsy as he helped her along the whole training. Plus she had not directly dealt with Valentine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Amazing Spider-Man did okay critically and good financially but is still the 4th highest grossing Spider-Man film behind even Spider-Man 3. And The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had worse critical reviews and is the 5th highest grossing Spider-Man movie, out of 5. But anyway, my point was more to the fact that a third was not made and rights given to Marvel and Marc Webb has no movies lined up. 

Also, I'm not saying it's impossible for new directors to lead a blockbuster, Jon Favreau had little experience and did Iron Man, as you said. James Gunn did Guardians. My complaint was specific to Marc Webb, he did music videos and one mediocre (in my opinion) romcom. And I wasn't entirely wrong because The Amazing Spider-Man franchise didn't exactly become the next Iron Man or anything. It's not all his fault but I still don't believe he was the right choice </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our defense had a few breakdowns of which the blackhawks capitalized each time. If it weren't for those, they would not have had any goals. The D had 3 turnarounds that resulted in 3 goals which sucks and is unfortunate but other than that, we played well. If we can tighten up the D to not make those mistakes, we can beat them. The team as a whole did not look sloppy nor marginal, otherwise it would have been 7-0. We had strength, good passing, Good scoring chances, control, speed, and cool heads (especially after getting down again).

3 mistakes cost us the game but that does not make our game play diminished besides those.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally hope we have at least an appearance from Shirley. And that Troy comes back obviously. I also am excited about the new characters. My expectations are about medium because I love Community but we are now missing 3 of the main study group members. But I have faith in Dan Harmon. How about the hint to more paintball (Dan's photo of Chang's gold gun)?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just watching Attack of the Clones and wondering if the scenes in Anchorhead where the Lars family lives (Luke's home in A New Hope) were filmed in the same location/same sets in Tunisia? I searched Google and couldn't find much. Just thought it would be really cool if they used the same filming locations/sets.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just got back and it was hilarious! Definitely not as classic as the original but found myself with uncontrollable laughter a lot! I know some people will see it differently but I really thought it was funny. Anyone else see it or want to know anything?  </TEXT>
