The Society was founded in 1887 with 28 members. APS now has over 10,500 members. Most members have doctoral degrees in physiology and/or medicine"

The lead researcher, Irina Petrache, has done numerous research on the dangers of smoking. Her main area of research is actually focused on the damage caused by smoking cigarettes on the lungs. http://medicine.iupui.edu/faculty-profile/ipetrach/Petrache-Irina 

The article also happens to be peer-reviewed here: http://ajplung.physiology.org/content/ajplung/early/2015/05/11/ajplung.00411.2014.full.pdf

The lead researcher also has articles in other journals like Nature on the dangers of smoking cigarettes.

I guess my comment here is an exercise in futility. Aside from some, it seems everyone else made up his mind here that big tobacco paid a user to get a post on a subreddit as if every earthling reads r/science (which btw would have been awesome, its a very insightful corner of reddit)

In fact, the conservative advantage in both of those areas is as low as it has been (or lower) than at any point since the start of the 21st Century, according to Gallup."

<TEXT> From the article The Internal Revenue Service is responsible for collecting this penalty from individuals who indicate on their annual tax filings that they have not purchased coverage. The agency can take the penalty out of a filers refund, but beyond that, its ability to recoup those dollars is extremely limited. The IRS cannot, for example, send agents to peoples homes or put liens on their houses. In the health-care law, Congress specifically curtailed the ability to enforce this penalty, giving the IRS fewer ways to collect it than there are for other tax fines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I agree with you that the treatment of women and LGBT in Islamic countries is beyond horrible. The practice is unfortunately not limited to Muslim countries - we still have these issues in other religions and other western countries.

Also, wearing the Burqa is something that predates all three main religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdah

I would also like to see these "billboards that are sometimes used to slut shame women" - I am curios as I have never heard or seen such billboards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Democracy and common sense prevail. Even though his position is to go to war, I praise Mr. Cameron for bringing this to a vote. And to the UK members of parliament who listened to the view of their people. It's terrible what is happening in Syria but history has proven that dropping more bombs won't bring a war to an end, it might just do the opposite by inflaming the whole of the Middle East. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right. However, most people I know, friends and family have bought houses close to work or/and in good neighborhoods. I don't think we in Holland have adopted the American way of buying a house an hour or 2 away from where we work. Also, from my understanding and I could be wrong here, there are a lot of houses for sale in undesirable neighborhoods.

So, I think we the Dutch choose to pay more and thus compete for scarce property.

EDIT: Here is some data from the Dutch Association of Real Estate Agents http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Netherlands/Price-History


    In 2008, house prices fell by 5.3% (-7.5% in real terms)
    In 2009, house prices dropped by 1.5% (-2.4% in real terms)
    In 2010, house prices rose slightly by 1% (-0.7% in real terms)
    In 2011, house prices dropped by 3.8% (-6.2% in real terms)

As you can see, the drop per year is not really dramatic percentage wise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Houses are scarce in The Netherlands and the pressure on prices has mostly been upward which is what keeps the house prices from tumbling rapidly. The cost of buying a house eats up a large proportion of income for an average Dutch citizen which is part of living in the Netherlands.

Volkskrant did a story about the Dutch economy. Here is the English version of it "10 misconceptions about the Dutch economy" http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2013/08/volkskrant_10_misconceptions_a.php </TEXT>

I have a hard time believing this will even be considered by the EU let alone implementing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This might help answer that question: http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/astrophysics/what-curiosity-will-and-wont-teach-us-about-martian-life

Over the years, planetary scientists have had to significantly revise their expectations for what they might find. In 1976, when the first successful Mars landersViking 1 and Viking 2reached the planets surface, many had high hopes that the spacecrafts instruments would be able to settle whether lifeeven simple microbial lifeexisted on the Red Planet. Each of the Viking landers carried a suite of instruments, including a combination gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer that was designed to detect organic compounds liberated from heated samples. But none of the Viking instruments found convincing evidence for the existence of life, or even its most basic ingredients.

About 30 years later, NASAs Phoenix Mars Lander made a discovery that may explain why the Viking spacecraft came up dry. In 2008, Phoenix found abundant amounts of the potent oxidizing agent perchlorate in the Martian soil. Perchlorate can destroy organic compounds released during sample heating, and it may also be able to destroy organic material in the upper layers of Martian soil, well before it is scooped into a spacecraft sample chamber. The surmise is that, if organic compounds exist on Mars, perchlorate may have prevented them from being picked up by Vikings instruments.

Curiosity could finally settle that question. The rovers Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument includes a mass spectrometer and a gas chromatograph, just as the Viking spacecraft did. But each of these instruments now boasts much better capabilities. Working in concert, they will be able to detect trace amountsat the level of a few parts per billionof organic compounds released from the stepwise heating of samples retrieved from surface soils and cores of rocks. Although this level of sensitivity isnt too different from Vikings, Curiosity will be able to heat the samples up to greater than 1000 C, twice the peak temperature of the Viking instrument set. That will help liberate materials that might otherwise stay trapped and inert in a sample. Whats more, SAMs analysis protocol calls for adding substances that can reduce the temperatures at which organic compounds are released from samples. Perchlorate salts are thought to be released only at higher temperatures, and with this procedure, samples will be heated to only 350 C, which should reduce their tendency to decompose.
