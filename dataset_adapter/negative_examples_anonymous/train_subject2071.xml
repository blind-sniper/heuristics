<TITLE> (UK) Undergraduate Lawyer needs help </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-10 14:18:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently a second year law student plodding my way through my degree. 

I know that I want to do my Law Practicing Course (LPC) once I finish my three years and then move onto a training contract. But, I also want a year out to live in News Zealand. 

Would I be best having a year out and then do my LPC which would hopefully be funded through a training contract? Or would I be best doing my LPC straight away after these 3 years and then have a year out and then go onto a training contract? The downside to the latter is that I would have to fund the 10,000 LPC myself. 

How common is it that training contracts fund LPCs? 

Any help/comments/sharing of own experiences would be great.

<TEXT> I visited Marrakech in the summer (amazing place) and I heard somewhere that the people begging for food will hoard it. 

There is, I accept, a large amount of poverty in Marrakech but I hear that even families who aren't living in poverty will beg for food. Apparently it's some kind of trophy or achievement. Pizza must be high on their list.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Giraffes - 

I've never seen a giraffe, I never want to see a giraffe. They just terrify me. They're colossal, their neck weighs the same as a small car, they have the ability to kill a pride of lions, they also have a 20inch tongue.  </TEXT>
