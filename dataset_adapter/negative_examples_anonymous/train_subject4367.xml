" I do agree with you that the public has every right to disagree with it if they so choose. Just like it is the comedian's right to continue with his comedy, and If public opinion is strong enough and oppose him he/she will stop."

This is exactly the process that this article is a part of. Public opinion grows through discussion. Which is what this article is.  

Free speech and Free markets censor things all of the time.

<TEXT> I took your last comment to a logical extreme, since you stated that you would not label minstrel shows as racist.


I think you are confused about my basic argument. Which is not in favor of authoritarian censorship. 
 
My entire argument is that, someone should be free to put on any show that they wish, however they are not free from the public's opinion. 
And the public should have the opinion that overt racism, sexism, etc is wrong and should thus choose to not support those things.

The original claim was that Amy shumers movie perpetuated certain negative stereotypes instead of using comedy to subvert or satirize them. 

I think you underestimate the degree to which media influences our worldviews.

Edit: disregard the minstrel show stuff. I got my arguments confused.
The Hitler statement was still a logical extreme of your previous statement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not talking about "shutting down" comedy in any way other than what the free market dictates. 

Society at large would not accept a 1920's minstrel show today, and as such it would not find investors and would not be written and performed. In effect, society shifted attitudes of race have "censored" the once popular minstrel show.

I haven't seen it myself but Kon Ichigawa's 47 Ronin is a fairly well regarded telling of the same story. 

I do have a soft spot for Last Samurai, but its not top 10 material. Ninja scroll and 13 Assassins are pretty cool. As is the original 13 Assassins by Eiichi Kudo, and two companion films "The Great Killing" and "11 Samurai"

I've watched too many samurai movies. </TEXT>

It does bug me that he cites "too dark" as his reason for distancing himself from Temple. When I think it is more likely the other, like you said.
the movie is just a case of Spielberg sticking a bit too close for comfort to the adventure serials he loves so much without finding a way to subvert or update their more questionable tropes for modern sensibilities.

<TEXT> well, according to several posters on the Originaltrilogy.com fanedit forums, this one is up there. 
However, The Phantom Edit seems to be one of the more well regarded. 
I think it will depend on how closely you want the edit to stick to the unedited films.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe that you may need to make a separate plain old youtuber account. I think that YouTube will take them down if they have the possibility of being monetized by the uploader, which you can't do with a base account. 
That was my thought process,at least. You should still be able to upload the long videos. 
YouTube is pretty mysterious to me though.  </TEXT>

This is actually a clip from a larger prequel edit.
(all 3 Movies are down to one 90ish minute film with a different score and plot.)
I tried to choose the best beats to cut to but some (like that one) may have gotten away. </TEXT>
