<TEXT> Non-disparagement clauses aren't commonplace in the traditional entertainment industry (they might be when you're affiliated with networks, but this is different than an NDA entirely) The Non-Disclosure Agreement would've been signed between Arin and Jon the moment they co-founded this business together. It's just common practice, especially in the entertainment industry.

And Polaris doesn't control any of their partners. Multichannel networks function more like agents/managers. They find better deals (such as brand deals, direct advertising, which means higher CPM rates) for a VERY small percentage of the profits. The only one with power in the relationship between content creator and MCN is the content creator </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're woefully underestimating what running a business is like. You also seem to think it's somehow easier if it's based around a youtube channel, video-games or both.

The amount of work that goes into simply managing taxes, income distribution, etc. is daunting alone. Sure we all want to be playing video-games for a living, but the truth is that's simply not what they do. They release a product to an audience (that involves them playing video-games) and they capitalize off of ad revenue and merchandise. (And it's been an intellectual property since day one. They both understood the importance of building a brand and selling yourself, they talked about it often) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's illegal to sing a copyrighted song on anything (movies, shows, internet videos, your own musical cover, ANYTHING) that you haven't payed a Mechanical License for. While it's highly unlikely that anyone would go after them for singing these, if they just happened to come across and flag it, just because they felt like it, the video would either get removed or all of the revenue would go toward the copyright holder.  If this happens 3 times, the channel gets shut down.

I felt there were some storylines that should've been edited down, if not out completely, like when they were hunting Arin/Barry, they didn't need to leave in the "phased" part, they could've just cut to them being found. Little things like that, but mostly, it wasn't as funny as it went on </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played WoW for 30 minutes and felt exactly the same as Arin/Barry. It was NOT fun and the only bit of joy I could scrape from it was messing around with my other friend who, in turn, was not having fun.

The point isn't "let's teach these guys how to have fun with WoW"

The point **is** "let's make these guys play WoW even though they don't want to." 

It was extremely funny to watch them scrape some fun out of this experience that they wanted no part in, that someone worked hard on preparing. There were several moments where I laughed my ass off, the one coming to my head right now is when it cuts to Ross in the interview room, with his head in his hands, not even saying anything, then cutting straight back to the action.

In the end, the entirety of the Game Grumps channel amounts to turning on the recording devices and spouting funny dialogue or waiting for something funny to happen in-game. It's a fucking **comedy** show

  The Grumps have an established fanbase now. They'll watch anything the Grumps put out

Or perhaps there are people who genuinely enjoy this, despite the fact *you* didn't. There is no need to insult people for their tastes and demean something you personally didn't enjoy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If the entertainer listening to the criticisms is ultimately their own personal choice, then what's the point of your comment here even existing?


There are a lot of stupid people that don't understand the concept of criticism. This is where people labeled ventgrumps as whiners, nitpickers, etc. 

There's already several posts complaining that they don't want to be downvoted if they criticize the show. Why can't they stand that other people have a different opinion? "Oh no I got downvoted! I guess everyone else is an idiot!" is the general consensus amongst people like this.

 The criticizers know that the Grumps have a choice. 

The criticizers don't seem to know much of anything. There was a guy on Ventgrumps shortly before it closed complaining that Game Grumps is "now a comedy show and no longer talk about game design" **that** is exactly the problem with illegitimate criticism. If you don't understand what the show is and always has been to begin with, why should you post your opinion at all? And why is it such a sin for someone to downvote your completely useless opinion?

 Thus, your comment is completely useless.

I can see that it went right over *your* head, but it's not useless if it helps ONE person understand my point </TEXT>

<TEXT> VentGrumps did the exact same thing if you tried to differ with someone's "Criticism" so don't act like this sub is so much worse when people downvote something they disagree with. 

If they change the show to fit someone else's tastes, then there is a huge chance that it'll no longer appeal to the people who currently enjoy it (the same goes for all forms of entertainment)

The biggest problem I saw with VentGrumps was that people started their ~~whining~~ "criticisms" with the basic assumption that every person agreed that the show has decreased in quality at some point. (and the only ones who didn't were little children/fanboys that had shrines dedicated to the Glorious Grump Gods, or something) This is simply not true and the show always has its ups and downs, people just tend to remember the best parts and think it was more entertaining in the past.

Whenever there was a **legitimate** criticism *(like pointing out that I don't want to listen to 10 minutes of Arin trash-talking a game or watch 5 episodes of Arin dying in the same spot over and over again [both of which were only annoying because the conversations became stale])* I never got downvoted on the main sub and plenty of other people discussed this criticism openly on the main sub without downvoting.

If your post receives a large number of downvotes, that just means more people disagreed with your criticism than those who agree with you, regardless if it's "constructive" or not. Why diminish other peoples' enjoyment to please this **one** random person? If a musician I don't enjoy asked my opinion on how to make their music "better" and I offered some ideas that completely conflict with what their music is all about, do you think they should listen? More importantly, do you think they should listen to a large group of people all saying something different?

The only times I've seen Game Grumps pay attention to constructive criticism is when the majority of the fanbase agreed on something (my examples a few paragraphs above pertained to Super Mario 64 and their final few sessions of that playthrough showed that Dan was definitely listening to the people at that time and they got through with the game without any more problems)
If that's the case, then you won't be downvoted. If it isn't the case and your criticism is downvoted, then you need to accept the different opinion and move on

In the end, an entertainer can only create something that **they** want to, because it is impossible to please everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a subject that interests me (I've never done any kind of drug though and probably never will)

I think what interests me the most is how many people have shared experiences. I've been meaning to look it up myself, but I think others might be able to explain it better than a long complicated article 

Edit: I'm looking for a **scientific** explanation, not the typical spiritual drivel most people use when explaining it (hence why it's hard to research) </TEXT>

Arin and Ross are each working on an animated series, Starbomb is already a highly profited music project, Danny is always working on NSP and Starbomb, and there will be plenty of ideas that they'll have/pursue in the future.

<TEXT> have you considered that he has a significant other that he doesn't discuss on the show? He's talked multiple times about not wanting to discuss his private life on the show.

Also, the whole "banging chicks" thing IS a part of his CHARACTER'S persona! Danny Sexbang and Dan Avidan are two different people (one is fictional, if that gives you a hint)

Lastly, why would "not having a significant other" make him gay? Are only gay people allowed to be single? Or are gay people not allowed to have significant others?

This is a big reason he wouldn't want to discuss his private life. Creepy posts like this </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, none of that should take 20 minutes. And that's not even real editing, that's just overlaying text, and if that takes you 20 minutes, then you might want to consider a different field. Plus, if you use the same font and color every video (like the Grumps do) then you would have it saved as a preset, reducing a 2 minute job to 2 seconds. Keyframing text to fly in does not take a lot of time, though it would vary, it shouldn't take longer than a minute (and consider that it happens once per episode ON OCCASION) 

With the format of editing Kevin is given, using primarily presets and an assembly-line style of churning out episodes, there is no reason he should have messed up any of the times people have counted (other than laziness) The only time he's even responded to people's criticisms is when it legitimately wasn't his fault (an episode being six minutes long) </TEXT>

But I agree with you, the Polaris collaborations are so pointless. Most people don't know the majority of their partners and most of them are kinda the same youtube channel, producing the same content under a different name. But I'm willing to bet this isn't a Polaris project, but a JonTron project that he requested Polaris's help in scheduling/contacting these other youtubers </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as stoners like to THINK they are funny or interesting when they're high, they're not. I don't think a single one of them even smokes weed (excluding Danny, who used to) and despite Stout Train existing, none of those episodes were good at all. (And I LOVE alcohol, so I thought it would be interesting, at least if they discussed it)

I wouldn't mind a Drunk Grumps with just Dan and Arin, especially if it's Arin's first time being drunk, but it would have to be a chill, non-obnoxious episode and not act all stupid-drunk like Barry and Ross did. Something more along the lines of Toon Grumps would be interesting. (I mean, they can play games, but be FAR less into whatever is on the screen)

But stoned? Sorry, but I'd skip over an episode of them just laughing uncontrollably for no reason and talking about how hungry they are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you watch Grumps for the gameplay, then something is seriously wrong with you.

However, it isn't entertaining if someone keeps making the same fuck-up over and over and over and over again and blames the game for it. Not because I'm watching the gameplay and I want to see progression, but because the conversation becomes stagnant, and it's just annoying to hear Arin ~~bitch about~~ er- "analyze" video-games.

Personally, I can't even stand when they talk about games at all, because for the most part, they aren't funny about it. But there were a few episodes recently where the fuck-ups actually were hilarious. Maybe they just need to learn to edit some moments out like that. If there are a bunch of fuck-ups that are funny, leave em in. If not, then just cut out that footage, and use the star selection screen as a point of transition, that way nobody knows anything was edited out

Just treat the show like a podcast that uses video-games to inspire discussion and it's entertaining. Otherwise, not so much. Arin and Danny are both super funny guys and I don't watch GG to see them beat games. It'd be better if they stopped playing them every time they weren't having fun </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like Arin the most. He's the funniest and he's clearly a caring and generous guy, considering he built this business using his popularity to give his friends employment, and to help them get their own popularity (I highly doubt Jontron or NSP would be doing well without their involvement with Egoraptor)

I think his comedy is better suited for what he's doing now, a twice a day, ten-minute show where he just improvises, making jokes about video-games, instead of his animations: an occasional 30-second to 1-minute short where he improvises, making jokes about video-games. I don't see all the hype about missing his animations. He's making the exact same jokes on Grumps he'd be making with his animations, he just doesn't have to take months to *animate* the jokes. And let's be honest, he's not exactly a good artist. Decent enough to make animations, but not good.

*Having that said*, I can't stand his opinions on most issues, and I think he has very bad analytical skills regarding video-games and movies. I also can't stand his whining (but I hate whining from anyone, even Dan and Jon.... but Arin does it the most)

And I think he handled the Jon fiasco the right way. If there was a bad-guy in the breakup, I'd think Jon was probably it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They mostly play older Nintendo games that are basically an abandoned market. The primary reason is, Nintendo hasn't found the Grump videos or cared enough to flag them.

Plus, Maker Studios has a better understanding of the ins-and-outs of the legal issues presented here. I think they'd be confident enough to defend the Grumps in court if Nintendo tried to claim the revenue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice to see a fan that understands that the channel is more than just a show where people talk around video-games. It's a legitimate business that produces a product in an industry where you walk a fine line between being profitable and being bankrupt, entirely depending on how your audience perceives you.

You also have a fantastic grasp on the New Media industry.

Most people (especially on this sub) don't understand the decisions that Arin made about mentioning Jon and they think that: Jon disagreeing with Arin's decisions = Arin lied.

I think they handled the situation perfectly, and I think they let the right amount of time pass to cement the new era of Game Grumps in, so that they could discuss the old era without the potential to damage the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. It takes time to produce, and they don't have a big post-production team. There's a lot of editing that needs to be done, which will be more complicated because they'll have to make sure it's coherent and actually tells a story (even if it is a Reality-Show-esque story) There seems to be a lot of live-action elements to it, and that's a lot harder to edit than game footage. There's a lot more to editing a real project than just putting clips in the correct order. Once the raw edit is done, it is immediately followed by Sound Mixing, Music, Color Correction, etc.  Each of which are difficult and time-consuming on their own.

They also have to balance this project with the other projects they're working on (some of which they probably haven't told the fans about yet) </TEXT>

Something like this makes sense. Put a video on private so that no claims can be made against it until the Grumps resolve the issue by either censoring the singing or changing it to a parody of the original song.

All it takes is three strikes and your channel is shut down permanently. Game Grumps has more than three videos that could be flagged for copyright infringement. And Youtube treats you as guilty until proven innocent.

<TEXT> You can't "display an entire work" if the work is interactive. One person's experience playing a game will be different than another's. Again, watching a video of gameplay is not the same as playing a game. 

The LP video is a separate product entirely.

Fair use is a defense for when someone is taken to court over an issue such as this. (Civil laws are also upheld in court, in case you didn't know)

Two of the things a court would use to determine if Fair Use applies are:
the nature of the copyrighted work (In LP cases: a platform for the real product, *Commentary* to be provided)
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyright work. (This varies based on the game's quality, but it at least represents an honest portrayal, as opposed to game trailers or reviews)

Last, but certainly most important, **there is no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered a fair use.**  http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Fair_use

<TEXT> I didn't say they were parodying the game, they are providing commentary. Fair use protects parody AND commentary, two different things entirely. Distributing a video of them playing a game, with commentary, doesn't infringe copyright, because the game is not meant to be observed, but interacted with.

The legality of these videos hasn't been established because nobody's ever questioned it, but one day when someone brings a LPer to court (likely Nintendo) it will (hopefully) rule in this industry's favor, because they are not releasing the same product as the game company. Watching gameplay and playing a game are not the same thing.


My point is, it's in a grey area now, legally, but as long as it is a grey area, Nintendo is not entitled to that revenue. </TEXT>

Truth is, Nintendo isn't entitled to the revenue because the players are providing commentary, which is the purpose of watching them.

This is considered a "transformative" use and is protected by copyright law.

<TEXT> **I'll start it off:**

"I'm having a waking nightmare,

I'm seeing colors in the sky...

Everybody wants to know about me,

but they don't know about my........

big ol' penis, flopping around,

it's three big feet of pleasure.

Put it in your mouth and put it in your vagine...

Everyone's having a real good time,

when they're hanging around my big floppy penis.

Can't quite stroke it really fast.

Covering three feet of skin with your hand isn't really easy.

Here's how fast I can jack my whole dick,

"Hah, ah, ah, ah, aaahhh."

That includes the back and forth motion,

let's do it again, "Ah aahhh."

"Ah ah ah ah ah ah aaahhhh..."

That's how fast I can jack my peen.

Everybody thinks that they have seen my penis,

but they haven't,

'cuz if they have...

they'd shit themselves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maker does not own his content, so his partnership with them is irrelevant. Youtube is an international platform and they also do not own his content. 

Okay, I guess I didn't realize (or care) where he lives, but it seems he currently lives in England.

A quick search of England's definition of Fair Use seems to indicate that their copyright laws are nearly identical to America's.

BUT, I just found a neat little thing during my quick research:

Maker studios has signed a deal (as has Fullscreen) for their partners to be able to monetize and cover for the full library of music that is registered under Universal Music Publishing. http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1538590/universal-music-publishing-inks-deals-with-fullscreen-maker-studios

That's a pretty big conglomerate and is likely where he's getting this music from (I don't know though, I've only seen a video or two of his, and immediately had to click away before I destroyed my laptop) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sweden doesn't recognize all of the U.S's copyright laws.

There is also no broad statutory limitation of fair use or fair dealing in Sweden, so he's far more protected in this area than anyone from America, where you literally can't even sing a song without the rights to do so, or a mechanical license and royalty payments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not fact. Straight up myth

Edit: I already received a downvote for being factually accurate, so lemme post this here:

Fair use is a defense one can use if taken to court for using a copyrighted work without permission. 

In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited (less than 30 seconds) and transformative purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.

Game Grumps singing random songs (in most of their cases) even people on youtube singing cover songs are NOT covered by this. It's illegal because it is a violation of U.S copyright law </TEXT>

<TEXT> They weren't "assimilated" by them. Too many people fail to understand what a MCN is and what it does. This is what it boils down to; a channel signs with them and they find good brand deals, better CPM rates, advice for growing a fanbase, or production assistance in return for a very small cut of the channel's profits. The end.

Maker doesn't own them, therefore they couldn't have 'assimilated' them. They're still an independent channel. MCNs function like a talent agency.

As for whether they started out **partnering** with Maker, that depends on whether or not Egoraptor and Jon were partnered with them before starting the channel </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you're trying to say, but a remix is just something that uses the actual work but adds or changes it a little. For a parody, you would have to reproduce the music (thus, the imitation) AND change the lyrics. Neither that nor a parody are abstract concepts, they're pretty clear.

But remixes can be protected under fair use as well, as long as they meet certain government standards, unfortunately, one of the requirements is that it can't be done for profit without permission </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, then they are **commenting** on the other target. Parody just means a piece of writing, music, etc., that imitates the style of someone or something else in an amusing way.

If they were 'parodies of the other target' then they would be imitating THAT target. Parody doesn't mean 'make fun of' even though it is usually a requirement to achieve effect.

I can reproduce the music and melody but change the words to, for example, "I'm Coming Undone" by Korn to "I'm cumming on Jon" and it would be considered a parody, even though I'm not commenting on the song itself. 

Not every parody has to be a Bart Baker video where you literally just trash the artist for the duration of their song </TEXT>

They aren't 'false claims.'

They performed songs on record without the rights. You can't do that, they can't do that, random people on youtube can't do that.

<TEXT> There is an actual legal problem, it's that singing songs you don't have the rights to is copyright infringement.

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm

A lot of people here have a misconception about this, thinking it's something covered under fair use, but that would only work if Game Grumps was a review show (and reviewing the song in question)

While youtube's automated "third-party content" detector does suck, they can repeal false claims. But if they get flagged with proof that they infringed on someone's song sitting right square in the middle of the video, it won't go over well for them.

I know it seems unfair and I know you see it everywhere on youtube, but it is illegal to perform cover songs without permission. (And, you'd be surprised to see how many covers have been flagged and now all the ad revenue goes toward the copyright holder) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't need to "see evidence" to understand how a multichannel network functions.

Maker has access to the channel, that doesn't mean they control it.

Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) are entities that affiliate with multiple YouTube channels, often to offer assistance in areas such as product, programming, funding, cross-promotion, partner management, digital rights management, monetization/sales, and/or audience development"

They pulled the videos because those videos were infringing on copyright. If all of those videos got flagged at the same time, and Youtube accepted the claims, the channel would be shut down immediately, considering that it only takes three strikes.

Maker was not acting maliciously, they were protecting the Grumps, even if the Grumps think they should be able to sing random songs.

They still can sing songs as long as they change the words and make fun of them, therefore classifying it as a parody. They'll soon realize that and I'm sure they'll go back an re-edit those videos to include parody versions of the songs they are singing (or at least censor those parts) </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol, no. It's not Maker's rules, Maker doesn't own Grumps. It's a simple business decision, don't do anything that might get your video flagged for copyright infringement.

And no, it isn't covered under fair use. You cannot sing or play a song that you do not have the rights to in a video that you are monetizing. Plain and simple.

Arin is smart enough to know that it's best not to risk getting his channel taken down over something as dumb as singing some song. 

Though, as long as they parody the song, changing the words/making fun of it, then they have free reign.


EDIT: Lol, why the hell was this downvoted? Because people "disagree?" I'm sorry folks, but that's the sad truth. That doesn't mean you downvote something. Do a small amount of research on copyright infringement, fair use, and the way MCN's function. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you've ever been in a live-action video, you'd probably understand what an uncomfortable experience it is. You have these bright lights on you, a camera pointing at you, a microphone dangling over your position, people behind the camera watching, and an audience in the future will be viewing your every move expecting to be entertained. The main thing that defines good acting is the ability to put that awkward situation past you and be entertaining or funny or portray a character with emotions.

Ross has a great technique of playing his uncomfortable awkwardness for laughs. Ross's mannerisms in the live-action videos are a character unto themselves. He's often at his funniest in those videos </TEXT>

<TEXT> Plain and simple: They wanted enough time to pass before mentioning Jon (Arin's post explaining WHY they didn't mention him was not a lie, despite Jon disagreeing with it)

They didn't want people flipping their shit over Jontron mentions or fighting over wanting the show to be what it was and not what it is. They wanted the show to move forward and not live in the past. Meanwhile, plenty of people, Jon and Nicole included, loved to troll you guys HARD on this sub

Finally enough time had passed when they felt like nobody would flip out over breaking the vow of silence. Dan had been there way longer and they reached a point where one of his serials was the longest running one. A perfect time to drop the silence. And NOBODY flipped out over it except for Conspiracy Grumps (it kind of killed it, TBH) Sure, plenty of people were shocked, happy, and glad to see it, but they didn't have a nerdgasm.

I don't think it was ever a breakup thing or a lost friendship. I think one guy just simply moved too far away to be involved. When your partner abandons you, you don't focus on the past, you focus on the present and doing your best to make a good product, which they did. Part of that required not mentioning Jon so that people didn't grow to loathe Dan or even Arin because it wasn't the way it started (And this sub particularly grew to loathe Arin) And they made the right choice because the show got exponentially better when Dan joined </TEXT>

A question I just thought of, though...

In an infinite universe, where mathematically speaking, anything that is possible or thinkable can and will eventually happen, then wouldn't THAT be in a way, predestination/fate? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thinking of Writing a Stand-Up routine for atheists... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-02 02:53:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I used to do stand-up but stopped doing it to pursue filmmaking/improvised comedy. Recently, some new opportunities have arisen that may require me to do some stand-up on the side. I wanna talk about subjects that actually interest me, and definitely subjects that haven't been done to death. I've written some jokes on Star Trek, a few on being married that send up the "married life cliches" in stand-up and sitcoms, and a few on death that lead into the concept of Hell. I'm most proud of the last ones because, not only do I think they are the funniest bits, but it's a very interesting subject that I don't think I've heard many comedians talk about. The only thing that comes to mind is George Carlin's "but he LOVES you" bit.

So, I'm wondering, what are some topics you, as an atheist, would love to hear some comedy about? You know, there's SO many things that comedians could touch on but they don't, I just want to know what the community itself wants. 

edit: For reference; here are some examples of the Hell material: "... I mean, you never see a father trying to discipline his kid going "HEY! BILLY! Quit hitting your sister with the stick or I swear to Christ I will punch you in the fucking face! And I'm not JUST gonna punch you.... I'm gonna punch you...... FOREVER!!!

Also, "The belief in Hell clearly stems from these peoples' history of being abused as children as well as living in a society that recommends and accepts it. It implants warped views of justice in their minds and gives them a sense of an unavoidable cosmic malevolence.... trust me, I googled it..." </TEXT>

<TITLE> Telling my daughter about "Heaven" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-26 03:51:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My daughter is two years old and I've been thinking a lot about when the time comes when somebody in our family tries to push religion on her. It'll definitely happen and it'll likely start with something they'll see as "small and harmless" like the concept of heaven. I'm trying to prepare my way of explaining it to her when she asks me about it, tell me if this sounds good:

"Well, a lot of people believe that when we die, we go to a special place called Heaven. Grandma, Grandpa and a few people we know believe this, but they don't know for sure. NOBODY knows for sure if it's real or not or even what it's like. We DO know that when we die, some people have these very realistic dreams and sometimes people go to heaven in these dreams where they'll be happy. Sometimes they see old friends or family members who made them happy. Sometimes they go to their favorite place in the world that made them happy in life. I think this is why people want heaven to be real, they want to be happy. But it's far more important to be happy here and now, while you can. Dying is a natural part of life... we're given a short time on this earth to experience happiness, sadness, anger, delicious food, fun, responsibility, and to do or create something important that makes everyone else's lives better. As for what happens when that time is over... NOBODY knows, even if they tell you they do. NOONE knows because noone's ever lived to tell about it.
