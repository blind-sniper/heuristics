<TEXT> Words right from Sandra Bullock in 2013- 

"Well, think of a bidet, right? said Bullock. Theres several processes. You have number one, you have number two, and then the cleanup.

But it doesnt stop there. Turns out the seashells are also musical instruments. You can use them as little maracas as well, continued Bullock, giving an example of the sort of beat you can drop with the futures answer to toilet paper. See, its a musical instrument, and its a hygiene element! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you watch the very first movie, it kinda explains that every fighter in Mortal Kombat has a superhuman ability, that gets intensified multiple times over when they enter Outworld and the Tournament. So in this theory I would assume it would increase their ability to take more devastating hits and as you said, until they lose the will to continue fighting.

<TEXT> Well Lisa was last week. Mark is currently with Karen as she has a broader reach in voter approval (speculation). Lisa was last seen sharing a pie with Connor, so it would appear he's still trying to salvage this campaign. Does Connor know something, or have any blackmail material on Mark, as he has been quiet throughout this whole poster incident, whereas Rawlins is flapping on about anything and everything. I think this whole poster incident has opened a Pandora's Box and I'm not sure this school is ready for such a deep scandal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Progress my ass. Janice's father had just received a pretty sizable bonus and was front runner for the General Manager of the Furniture and Pie Emporium, which would've included a hefty pay raise as well. Why would he leave that position, especially considering the entire family's deep rooted ties to the community. THEY started the Neighborhood Watch (which ended up a big hit and reducing teen smoking), but, as we all know, Rawlins despised it as he was known to smoke cigarettes and they would always hassle him for curfew. Two big no no's for Neighborhood Watch. If these sheeple would open their eyes they would see that Rawlins has already been on-record saying Neighborhood Watch is "stupid," and they "don't need it." Don't need it? Teen smoking down 15%, Dad's are happier as they feel cool at night, Mom's can drink wine in peace while Dad is gone, it makes everyone happier. Don't need it Rawlins? Maybe we don't need you.

Mark's gold digging for voters and we all know it. Why have they never kissed in public? Can we talk about Karen's brand new Audi she came to school in? Her parents drive Chevy's because they are a middle class family. You think she got that all by herself? Part time host at Applebee's isn't buying you a new Audi sweetheart. </TEXT>

Where is Janice these days, did she really "move," out of state? I think this whole thing goes deeper than we can fathom, nobody2000. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They ran with this idea last year when Jacksonville was the worst team and Alabama was the best, they also ran 3 of the other worst teams in the NFL.

PredictionMachine.com ran 50,000 computer simulations of the best team in college football, the Alabama Crimson Tide, vs the four worst teams in the NFL, the Buccaneers, Steelers, Giants and Jaguars.

Jacksonville won 91.4% of the simulations, by an average score of 32-13. The Giants won 95.4% of the time, the Steelers won 95.7% of the time, and the Bucs won 95.8% of the time.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Growing up, I was a pretty typical 90s kid in America. I loved playing outside, whether it's sports or playing in a creek, but I also loved playing video games with friends and especially playing against them in Pokemon. Days would wisp by as a child, with no cares in the world other than my family, friends, and video games. I had a few close friends in the neighborhood I grew up around, even the one kid who was a little younger that had lived in the borderline condemnable house, well call him Jack. A house with plain-sight cracks to foundation, old, dingy siding hanging off partial tears from the wall, and almost every window how some extent of damage to it. He didnt have much, but he had us, his friends. He would be ecstatic to come over for dinner and video games, as he didnt get the greatest of either at home. A small part of me as a child felt empathy, but he was such a good friend that it would always be overlooked that he is poor, he was one of us. Jack was an integral part of the small circle of neighborhood kids we had created over the years. 


One curious thing about Jack is that, although he was older, he seemed to be failing at aging, if at all. We were always told as kids that he had some complicated disorder that made him LOOK that way, but he always seemed wise beyond his years. He would always give advice that youd want to hear from an adult figure like an adult brother, but not quite a parent. The type of advice that was right, but wasnt coming from an authority figure like a parent, so you would actually TRY to listen to them.  Sometimes, he would say weird things and would immediately apologize, saying that he slipped. We never saw him fall, but he would always tell us he slipped. I remember him doing this quite often, and one time in particular, made me relatively uneasy.


Now we were all close friends, a small family if you will, so what Jack did this day was completely unexpected. As we were playing around tossing a football amongst each other, Jack just started shaking his head. It was a slow shake, until he looked down and started shaking his head in a more rapid manner. We all immediately cease what we were doing to help him, but it was already lost at this point. His head is furiously shaking, while he clutches his hair, to the point we thought he would rip it right from his scalp. It was this moment I will never forget, it turned my life upside down and inside out. It still affects me as I write this. In that moment, Jack stopped shaking, he looked at all of us with a look weve never seen, this wasnt Jack anymoreit looked like Jack aged 15 years in that 30 second time frame.




STOP THIS RIGHT NOW! IM DONE, ITS OVER! WAKE THE FUCK UP! Jack shouted, in a sad, but angry tone. I chime in after the dust of shock settled. S-stop what Jack? We were only tossing a football I was still shaking as Jacks voice rattled each and every one of us to the core. I saidWAKE THE FUCK UP TIM! Jack rattled again, this time directed right at me. I am now terrified of what is coming or, what may have already happen. I am enveloped by the emotional cocktail of fear, sadness, angst, and even anger. What are you talking about Jack, Im right here in front of you, wide awake, just like every day. Do you want me to get your Mom, or mine, or Tylers? I questioned him, still shaking in emotion. No Tim, I want you to wake up. I cant live here any longer, I want to grow up again. He replied, with tears welling up in his eyes. Im scared Jack, what are you talking about?? I said, completely enveloped by fear at this moment. Jacks knees became weak as he crippled to the ground, overcome with emotion, he seems angry but he is full on crying. After a few moments, he managed to mutter out a few words.




Thisnone of this is real Timmy. I hurt you, I hurt you bad. You wont wake up, and all I want you to do is wake up. I want to apologize to the real you.




In this moment, I was frozen. Not paralyzed, more so frozen in complete terror.  Out of nowhere, my head feels as if it was an overinflated balloon ready to pop. Writhing in pain a get a few words out to Jack, Whats.happening. My head, its going to explode! Jacks head perks up, with his eyes wide open now, he wipes away the tears and starts looking around. As the pain finally subsides after what seemed to be hours, I notice something odd. Everyoneeverything is gone except Jack and myself. Dead silence, I feel nothing, no emotion, no painnothing. It appeared that Jack had the same feeling take over him.




I tried Timmy, I really did. You werent supposed to hurt anyone else. I tried to stop ityouyoure just a monster.




Its back. The pain, the grueling headache I had just moments ago. I can only squeeze my eyes shut so hard, this is unbearable. I finally gain the strength to open my eyes and standing in front of me in a dimly lit, borderline-condemnable house, was Jack. The same, rapidly aged Jack I was just speaking to. Except I wasnt a child anymore, and we werent outside throwing a football. With very little light in this room, I could make out some electronics laying around, with a few wires attached to both myself and Jack, but I cant make out what is all over me. Jack sadly lowers his head as he begins taking off the wires. Whatthefuck Jack. WHAT IS GOING ON?! I inquire, with my voice getting louder with rage every time a new word is muttered. I feel it, the rageits taking over. Is this what Jack was talking about? What did I do? Who did I


FREEZE! DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW JACK! WE WILL SHOOT IF YOU MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS! WHAT THE FUCK? Who are these people and how do they know Jack? Better yet, why are they pointing their guns at me? Jack is right in front of me. Im not a monster of any sorts. It was then I realizedIm a liar. I instantly black out, and now Im covered in blood, and the light from the sun is peaking through an old doorway. I see bodies everywhere, but no Jack. I see my childhood friends, SWAT officers, a preacherand so many more. Who did this? As I question myself, I notice a dusty, half covered mirror catch a small ray of sunshine from his corner. I uncover it, and I know who I see in the mirror, but its not Tim. Tim is dead, they are all dead. I.amJack, and I will never be stopped. I am in every single one of you, dont suppress your Jack, or I will be the next thing you see in the mirror. 




See you soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She's legitimately nuts. I found out shortly after hooking up with her, twice. She held a knife to her ex boyfriends throat when he wanted to sleep for work the next day instead of having sex, I told her that was it between us the next day. I received CONSTANT calls for the next couple days, then it turned occasional calls. Finally, nothing. Fast forward two years, she now has a baby and (to my knowledge at the  time) she had just broken up with her boyfriend. Also at this time, it had been awhile for me and I had a couple drinks. She called me with the sole intention of having sex, so stupid me went and did it....twice again. It was the same thing, oh why don't you wanna be with me until finally she let loose. "Fuck you asshole, my boyfriend will be here any minute and he's gonna know about this!" I laughed directly in her face and saw myself out of there. He calls me twenty minutes later, I told him my side, he ended up staying with her and not really being pissed at me. Fast forward to now (almost ten years since we originally hooked up). In the past year she has contacted me, seemingly friendly. Until she starts asking questions like, "Do you think it could still work between us?" and other stupid, bat-shit crazy things like that. I respond the same way I always have for the past 9 years. "Nah, we are two different people, would've never worked." Today, I just moved from PA to NC the other day, somehow she caught wind and was all "Oh I'm gonna miss you I wish we could've been together, at least one last time before you move." HUNG UP immediately. 


So yea, that bitch is still crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was walking to 7th grade math class when a commotion quickly swept the school, so fast that it seemed like the whole school found out and knew about this in between periods (about 7 minutes). I sat down and the teacher told us that it was now a study hall, and we all just watched the news in shock, and the rest of my classes for the duration of  the day all turned into study hall's while we just watched the news in every class. About halfway through the day, our principal came over the loudspeaker to announced exactly what happened, and that we will have the news on every TV in the building, so we can be up to date with such a brutal moment in our nations history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I was a bartender/server, I had to work the day after my birthday. Now I had never gone out for my birthday, even at 21. I would always party at my parents house. So I underestimated the phrase- "Hey it's my birthday!" Needless to say, I got hammered. Woke up on a friends couch who proceeded to wake me up just to wake and bake and start drinking again, completely forgetting I had work in a few hours. About an hour and a half before my shift, I remembered. Oh no, this was not good. Got a ride home, showered...that's about all I could do. I got into work and immediately my co-workers were calling me out. They were all pretty cool so management was unaware. We ended up getting really busy in the afternoon, and I was holding the fort down great, I thought. Right before I leave, my General manager pulls me and and lays it out. "I don't know how you did it, but you did a great job today, and not one customer complained that you were fucked up while working." She proceeded to let me know to never do it again (obviously) and I went home with one of my best Sunday afternoons (Tip-wise) that I had ever had, oh, and a horrible hangover.

TL;DR: Bartended and Served drunk and high after my birthday, customers didn't know, manager did, made lots of money and no trouble. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I was sitting at work at my desk alone


Not one person in the office, nor the building


Silence surrounds me, broken only by keyboard taps


Occasionally the printer spools, or phone rings


This is a normal Tuesday night


Unfortunately, the normalcy ceases here


I hear ghastly noises


They slowly escalate


Paralyzing screams


Silence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8 years ago, I used to sell weed. One day, me and Momma Dukes got into a bit of a tif, (I was 17 at the time, so the argument was pointless) and all of the sudden she says, "Ya know what?" and proceeds to walk up into my room, a few seconds later, comes walking down the steps with a quarter pound of weed I had in my room. She throws it at me and tells me, "There's no way you are smoking all of that bud!" (My Mom, 48 at the time, referring to my weed as "bud," was shocking enough, on top of the fact she found it) She then tells me she already called the cops..I walk upstairs and put the weed right back where I had it. I come back downstairs and my Mom let me sit in absolute fearfor about 10 minutes until she told me to get rid of it, I was a moron for doing it, and she didn't call the cops. That ten minutes, I thought I was fucked. </TEXT>
