And now that gay marriage is "settled", they won't have to oppose it at every campaign stop during the primary and look wildly out of step with national public opinion during the general.

<TEXT> I know the advertising (and my recruiter) say the reserves is "one weekend a month, two weeks a year", but how true is this? I've heard stories of longer/extra drill periods that come up. I'm more than happy to work extra when needed, but I live a few hours from the closest NOSC so I just wanted to get an idea. 

Also would officers be expected to work more hours/drills than enlisted?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I regularly do 60+ just at my job alone. I think the biggest thing for me is that once I'm in my office I do nothing but work until I leave. So maybe it's about picking a location and forcing yourself to go there. It doesn't have to be an office, but maybe go to a library or somewhere where you won't be distracted by "fun" things, and just make it a rule that you are going to spend X number of hours there everyday. 

I think getting into a routine and sticking to it is the biggest thing that helped me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking just from my experiences, I definitely felt that way during my first time in China. Most of the people I've talked to who lived in China were students who studied there for a semester (like me) or maybe a year, or English teachers who were there for a short period of time. Since most know going into it that it's just temporary, it doesn't really feel like the "real world" of work or putting down roots. 

In my case I (along with 20 others from my school) were only there a semester. Classes were a joke, everything was super cheap (early 2000's), and we had tons of free time. So I had half a year of no real responsibilities or expectations, which definitely made it seem unreal.  </TEXT>

I beat him with the inside of my armor plate. I smash it against his face again and again and again until blood flows all over the inside of my shirt. He kicks and flails and screams. Every scream gets cut off by another blow from the plate..." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think so, largely because of the USSR. Stalingrad was in 1942-1943 and the Nazis were retreating from the East following that. The Soviets did get a lot of help and goods from the U.S. Lend-Lease so that might have taken a hit if Germany's navy was improved, but the Russians would still been able to supply most of their troops without it.

Still, I think the Nazi's would have eventually been beaten, or at least forced into a stalemate, it just would have been more drawn out and bloody. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can see that. There was an article (that I can't seem to find now...) about drone pilots who were having a hard time with killing targets. When they interviewed them they said that sometimes a drone could be assigned to monitor a house for days or weeks, and the pilots would see their whole family life, when dinner was each day, when the kids played in the front yard, etc. And then one day they would just get the order to fire on one of the people who was confirmed to be a terrorist. Takes a psychological toll, even from a thousand miles away.  </TEXT>

I'm non-prior, masters degree, and 10 years in research analysis and project management. My recruiter said being non-prior was probably my biggest detriment.... I was just wondering if I should go through the long application process to give it a shot, or if would be better to enlist and work my way from there? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally agree. I work for a consulting firm and we see this problem a lot in the private sector too. Companies take their best computer programmer, who loves what he does, and say "Hey this guy needs to be a manager!" Then they promote him to a job he hates and force him to deal with paperwork and HR issues instead of programming.

<TEXT> I lived in Chongqing for about 6 months and then in Beijing for a short while a few years later. I think there are definitely a lot of cool elements that you can find around the country, with as big as it is. My biggest impression was that growth and change are so fast that you'll see brand new buildings built right in the midst of old hutongs and a mix of old and new everywhere.

So it ends up being pretty cool to eat noodles from a street vendor cooked over a little charcoal stove, and then walk across the street to a neon-lit club blasting techno and k-pop. 

I'd definitely recommend it, but you may want to visit first or study there before taking the plunge and actually moving there for work.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT][MOVIE] Arabic movie about a guy juggling two girls. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-14 01:16:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In December 2012 I was on a Saudia Airlines flight and watched an Arabic movie (subtitled in English) about a guy who had sunglasses and goatee. He was a concert promoter or something and got with a girl singer, but then later got bored and got with a new girl he hired. Then he ends up in the hospital with amnesia and the girls get together to trick him and pay him back.

For some reason I thought the movie was Egyptian, but I could be wrong. I also thought the main actor was a comedian named BoBo or BoPo or something like that...

Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should go to [SongMeanings.com](http://www.songmeanings.com )

Look up whatever song you're interested in, and there's usually some pretty good insights by people that post on there. 

You should also do "We Didn't Start the Fire" Billy Joel. People of his generation were being blamed by older generations for their lose morals and other social problems, and the song was a response to say "look at all this shit that's gone on through history...it didn't start with us". Plus teachers love Billy Joel ;-) </TEXT>

As far as living forever, it's going to end eventually at some point with the heat death/big crunch of the universe. I have no idea if there is a God, but I figure it's best to just be nice to everyone and live as long as possible with technology.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was also a story the Russians built a nuke in their embassy in Washington DC. Since diplomatic packages aren't allowed to be searched by customs, the Russians had it brought in piece by piece and had an expert assemble it in the embassy. That way, if things went to hell, they could detonate a nuke right in the middle of DC with zero warning time or chance of being intercepted.

But that fact that the people got together and said "It's the 21st century, let's stop messing around with different currencies, trade barriers, etc. and just work together is amazing. It really gives me hope for the future."

<TEXT> From Wikipedia:

In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses. These have been used to protect Mountain Goats in Montana, Spotted Salamanders in Massachusetts, Bighorn Sheep in Colorado, Desert Tortoises in California, and endangered Florida Panthers in Florida. </TEXT>

I also think it's a good idea to get as much done the night before to make the morning easier. I always make my lunch, pack my bag, and lay my clothes out at night. That way in the morning I'm not rushing to get everything ready. I just grab my stuff and go.  </TEXT>

I've seen the physical copy that has all three games (2, 3, and 4) but when I go to the Xbox site or get on Xbox live, it only has an option with two games (and Peace Walker as a separate game):

<TEXT> I think about this same thing  lot too. I'm 28 and just hoping to stay healthy And alive long enough for those advances to start rolling in.I'm pretty optimistic though since the pace of technological growth is accelerating so rapidly. After the airplane was invented it took less than 50 years for man to break the sound barriers and then we walked on the moon in just a little more than 20 years after that.

So I think if I can hang in there for 50 years we will hopefully be at a point when life can be extended much longer. </TEXT>

On the other hand, if we say they are a legitimate threat and they start something, then we can say "well we've been saying they are dangerous all along and now they're attacking so it's time to defend ourselves. " </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm usually pretty internationalist, but lately I feel like we should just tell the Middle East "screw you guys, I'm going home" and let that region work itself out.

I know it would create a safe haven for terrorist, mess up our oil supply, humanitarian disater, etc. but seriously it feels like it's just going to be a perpetual clusterfuck over there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally agree with "quality not quantity". 

The past 2 computers I bought were the cheapest laptops I could find and they all broke within 2 years. Then I spent a little more on the last one and I've had it for 7 years and its still going strong. To me, that's a lot more minimalist in the long run. </TEXT>

...but if you want to use all the game mechanics, maybe just limit which magics you use to junction. Like maybe only junction the basic level (fire, thunder) and avoid all the third-level (thundaga, etc.). Also stay away from triple and ultima and other crazy-powerful spells. </TEXT>
