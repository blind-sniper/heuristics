<TEXT> the first moon landing, Apollo 11, was certainly broadcast far and wide. But NASA only allowed the TV stations to film from their screen (instead of allowing the "news" stations to have a direct feed)--which made the film very grainy. 

as for your "rockstar" quote--Joe Rogan made a good point about the moon landing being a Technological God, something that no one is allowed to question. Others question the God Box--the TV--even Bill Clinton had a quote in his book in which Clinton himself questioned the moon landing by Apollo 11. 

The "press conference" the Apollo 11 astronauts held a few weeks after they came back is quite odd. In the Q   A portion a member of the audience asks the Apollo 11 team if they could comment on the long-term impact of their moon landing. Neil Armstrong (who spoke the famous "One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind") acts as if he doesn't want to answer the question and ends up going last.  Armstrong earlier had claimed he thought up those Historic Words during the trip--but in the Q   A Armstrong is tongue-tied and acts as if he is sitting at the defendant's table of a criminal court proceeding. Armstrong also retired from NASA after the "moon landing" and only gave a few interviews.

Look at how excited and giddy with JOY the Apollo 11 crew is at the press conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKl_oXxsQiA

WHY doesn't Neil Armstrong smile and shout out loud "We went to the moon!!!"

Instead he avoids using those words and calls the the moon landing an "adventure"

Either these 3 got the shit scared out of them by aliens--or they didn't go to the moon and don't want to continue LYING TO THE PUBLIC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> BONUS: the 9/11 Commission DC offices were in a CIA managed office building (rent-free, of course)...oh wait--didn't the CIA get busted spying on the SSCI? How hard could it have been for them to spy on the 9/11 Commission?

-----------------

from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):

The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information. </TEXT>

<TEXT> there is NOTHING in our lifetimes that has affected the entire planet more than 9/11...TRILLIONS of dollars poured out into the (MIP)^2 Complex.^#

highly recommend you watch [KILL THE MESSENGER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT4pgoc6-0M) (made in Australia) which reports how Sibel Edmonds sent shockwaves thru the FBI, DoD, CIA, AIPAC, defense corporations, the 9/11 Commission--and the NeoCons.

pre-9/11 is interesting too: Operation Darkheart (DIA)...the warning which the U.S. supposedly gave to Afghanistan: it will either rain money or you will have bombs dropped on you (the energy companies wanted a pipeline built and needed Taliban approval...eventually Hamid Karzai, a former UNOCAL exec, was placed in charge of Afghanistan) see: http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/oil.html

even Kenneth Feinberg is suspicious: he wrote an early version of what would become the Patriot Act--then he became the head of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...was the intention to pay off the families and shut them up via the non-disclosure agreement?

Cryptome: What will this be used for?

A: It depends on who the user is. Law enforcement and private investigators will use the information to try to:

1. Identify individuals based on behavioral analysis of comments, etc.

2. De-anonymize individuals and leverage this information on other platforms, i.e. checking identical/similar usernames and using the behavioral analysis to predict other (online or offline) hangouts and activities in order to build a more complete picture.

Sociologists and psychologists will use it to build behavioral models for individuals acting as individuals and for ad-hoc groups of individuals without any external organization, goal, etc.

Members of the public and historians will use it to look at and for public figures and to better understand them. More importantly, the public should use this database as a wake-up call that the driving force behind Big Data isn't Big Brother - it's the masses. Between this and the Dark Net Market archives and some other releases in the last few weeks, it's becoming more apparent that the "right to be forgotten" may be recognized by some governments but private individuals and researchers, not just megacorps, remain major obstacles to it.

This is, simply put, the biggest example of open source SIGINT to date. The fact that it was done legally and openly, and not as the result of a hack or data leak, may make it seem less newsworthy - but if anything, it makes even more alarming to privacy advocates. It's not a one-off either, it's just one of the biggest signposts we've seen so far.

WhoWhatWhy has discovered that scores of young people have been denied their freedomand their Constitutional right to a speedy and public trialwhile being held in Chicago jails, some of them for years.

A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that dozens of detainees who were under the age of 18 when they were booked have been incarcerated for more than two yearssimply because they couldnt post bail while awaiting trial. Thirty one juveniles have been held for at least two years and another 33 have been awaiting their trial in jail for more than a year. Twelve have been in detention for three years or more.

The findings are part of a WhoWhatWhy investigation into the treatment of teenagers who are sitting in the nations jails because they cannot afford bail. The probe was triggered by the suicide of Kalief Browder.

The story of Kalief Browdera 16 year-old who was imprisoned for three years after being unable to come up with thousands of dollars in bail after allegedly stealing a $40 backpackcast a harsh light on New Yorks grievously flawed bail system.

While New York City announced this month that it would no longer require bail for suspects accused of low-level or non-violent crimes, this revamp doesnt go in effect until next year, likely leaving many minors to languish in prison while awaiting trial.

Worse, other cities continue to operate similarly flawed justice systems whose excesses have gone largely unscrutinized, until now.

Chicago is one of those cities, as revealed by a WhoWhatWhy Freedom of Information request. While Chicagos Cook County Sheriffs Office does not collect data on specifically why such detainees remain in jail, a follow-up with a Sheriffs Office official confirmed that it is fair to assume that individuals in the jail who remain in custody despite being given a cash bond are unable to afford to post the required amount.

The data from Chicago suggest that Kalief Browders case is not a tragic anomaly but an indicator of a larger, perhaps nationwide pattern. While we do not have information on the alleged crimes of the Cook County Jail detainees, we do know that they all received a set bail, and that bail is only set for individuals who are not considered a significant danger to the community.

We are continuing to investigate how Chicagos juvenile justice system compares to New Yorks. WhoWhatWhy has submitted a Freedom of Information request and is still awaiting a response from Laura Mello, the Freedom of Information Law Officer for the Department of Corrections, City of New York.

<TEXT> I remember him from the *News Radio* comedy series on nbc, then the UFC...I was also first against the MMA when it first came out, but grew to like it and have watched it up until about 3 or 4 years ago. 

As for Rogan being a propaganda agent--I'd think it is far more likely he has been approached and commanded not to say too much regarding certain subjects. By agreeing (or being forced to agree) that would make him a propaganda agent. 

Alex Jones has made his Topic #1 OKC and 9/11 from Day 1, while Rogan is more of a conversationalist with jokes, drugs, and a truth chaser. Jones now presents everything as News and Editorial--attacking the NWO. I wouldn't doubt if Jones is seriously fucked with by the USG and pressured not to report on certain subjects. For example, infowars was all over the Boston Bombing from Day 1--then during the trial they were completely silent and only published an article from whowhatwhy.com until after the trial. Jones has also added a lot of main stream media links to his webpage--most likely to keep from getting fucked by google searches and the threat of losing his press pass...(Never really looked too close at Jones--I find him a bit abrasive). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Victor Bout Theories... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-15 06:17:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think it may have been a missile that hit the Pentagon on 9/11...it's possible Israel (with the OK from the CIA-Wall Street) bought the missile from Victor Bout with the intention being to set up the Russians as having sold Al Qaeda a missile...maybe Victor Bout recorded his deal with the Israelis--so they had to get Bout outside of Russia to set him up and take him out of circulation...(maybe the video of Bout selling the Israelis the missile is the only thing keeping him alive).

I just have a feeling Deep in my gut that the U.S. was scared shitless by Victor Bout--the whole extradition seemed to be much more than some Russian arms dealer selling weaponry around the globe.

------------------

(from wikipedia, link below)

Viktor Anatolyevich Bout (Russian:   ) was born 13 January 1967, near Dushanbe, Tajik SSR, Soviet Union.

A citizen of Russia, he was arrested in Thailand in 2008 before being extradited in 2010 to the United States to stand trial on terrorism charges after having been accused of intending to smuggle arms to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to use against U.S. forces.[1][2][3] On 2 November 2011, he was convicted by a jury in a Manhattan federal court of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and officials, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organization.[4][5]

A former Soviet military translator,[6] Bout had reportedly made a significant amount of money through his multiple air transport companies,[7] which shipped cargo mostly in Africa and the Middle East during the 1990s and early 2000s.[8] As willing to work for Charles Taylor in Liberia as he was for the United Nations in Sudan and the United States in Iraq,[7][9] Bout may have facilitated huge arms shipments into various civil wars in Africa with his private air cargo fleets during the 1990s.[10]

Bout says he has done little more than provide logistics, but former British Foreign Office minister Peter Hain called Bout a "sanctions buster"[7] and described him as "the principal conduit for planes and supply routes that take arms from east Europe, principally Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine, to Liberia and Angola".[11]

In cooperation with American authorities,[9] Royal Thai Police arrested Bout in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2008.[12] The United States ambassador requested his extradition under the Extradition Act between the Kingdom of Thailand and the United States, which was eventually mandated by the Thai High Court in August 2010.[3] Before his extradition to the United States in November 2010, he expressed confidence that this U.S. trial would eventually lead to his acquittal but this did not occur.[13][14][15] From January 2011 to June 2012 Bout was incarcerated in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City.[citation needed] Following his conviction, he was sentenced on 5 April 2012 to 25 years imprisonment by a U.S. judge. In June 2012 he was transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, Illinois.[16][17][18][19]

<TEXT> Wow--never saw that Pat Tillman death info...Michael Ruppert said Tillman was shot in the forehead--but then seemed to indicate Tillman was a Hot Shot looking to win a medal (so his own crew took him out). Ruppert has stood by that version--its on Truth tv and on his Joe Rogan interview...

Odd that Joe Rogan has rolled back and no longer openly states "NASA didn't go to the moon"...In Rogan's interview with Neil de Grasse Tyson, Rogan definitely backtracks from his previous position. He argues just as a counter-argument (stating he doesn't believe it anymore) and still leaves Neil De Grasse Tyson looking like a fool quite a few times.

I could see that young cop being a PsyOp--and I could see Rogan having to make deals with the Pentagon (who sponsored lots of  MMA). I wouldn't doubt if about 1/3 of Rogan's audience are military. </TEXT>

To be clear: I think it may have been a missile...it's possible Israel (with the OK from the CIA-Wall Street) bought the missile from Victor Bout with the intention being to set up the Russians as having sold Al Qaeda a missile...maybe Victor Bout recorded his deal with the Israelis--so they had to get Bout outside of Russia to set him up and take him out of circulation...(maybe the video of Bout selling the Israelis the missile is the only thing keeping him alive).

<TEXT> Allen Dulles at the CIA actually handled quite a bit of it by networking with the publishers and editors (*NYT*, Time, CBS, etc...)...By the 1970's, the CIA also Bought plenty of journalists as well (see Carl Bernstein's 1976 *Rolling Stone* article "The CIA and the Media")...

J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) was also networked--mostly with smaller newspapers...but both the CIA and FBI eventually made Hollywood sing their tune as well...Today, the Pentagon helps fund and often OKs the scripts of films--Top Gun, Pearl Harbor, Transformers, Black Hawk Down, etc...The FBI began their Hollywood propaganda way back in the 1930's...

The media have turned into conglomerates--so no one wants to publish stories which will end up hurting their subsidiaries...Going back to WWII, NBC was owned by RCA (which owned companies that made radio equipment for the military)...

Today, no one wants to investigate the missing $9 TRILLION at the Pentagon because: 1) it is expensive to conduct investigations; 2) the reporter could be killed like Michael Hastings; 3) the corporate board likely all invest in defense/intelligence corporations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently watched *Kubrick's Odyssey* and *Room 237*...sounds like Alice (Bill's wife) may have had some relevant scenes cut out (possibly involving the man she dances with...possibly there was a dream sequence where she was also at the illuminati/orgy party)...also: the very end does show their daughter possibly being taken by 2 men (who appeared earlier in the background of the film) while they are at the toy store...

A couple things I noticed: while many people have mentioned the use of light bulbs in the background of "The Shining"--SK uses the light bulbs in almost every second of EWS. The light bulbs are supposed to represent the Scotch/Front Screen process which SK used in filming 2001 (and possibly to film the Fake Moon Landing). The lights, obviously have other allusions--but to use light bulbs in almost every second of EWS, and in such an over-the-top manner, seems to be screaming "LOOK--have you ever seen so many X-mas lights in a film?"

The other thing which stands out is that it is X-mas, yet there is NO SNOW...even though it is late December you cannot see anyone's breath or see car exhaust--not even a frosted window...the landscape looks more like fall than december...interesting that the college kids who push Bill around while he is walking--at least one of them has on a Yale sweatshirt (cough cough).

--------------

edit: re-watched EWS--all six of the drunken idiots who yell/push Bill have some type of Yale swag on them--one has a Yale varsity-style jacket, the rest of them have Yale sweatshirts (some underneath coats) and few of them have Y baseball hats on. (guess who played first base for Yale in the late 40's--GHWB) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely feel your frustration, but The Cabal rules the media--they can sell any lie (or just force the media not to cover a story). Once in a while the media breaks a story--but ultimately there is no meaningful follow-up. Case in point: June 28th (a saturday) the Wash Post broke a story accusing the CIA of withholding 14,000 photos from evidence--no major network has followed up...

Even if there is an official congressional investigation--it ends up as controlled opposition (a Farce).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, there is quite a bit of evidence that the Cold War was mostly **THREAT INFLATION**.

-----------

**Q: Its 1961, the height of the Cold War, the U.S. has 40 nuclear-capable Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles--how many ICBMs did the Soviets have?**

According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)


------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

Odd that the *Post* would publish the story on a Saturday--the lowest day of circulation for newspapers (there is no time stamp--not sure if this article ran in the Saturday or Sunday edition). 

But, coming on the backside of the CIA spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the CIA lying about spying on the SSCI, the 6 year process of releasing the Torture Report--and, of course, the CIA destroying 90 videotapes of "interrogations"...You would think this story would have caused some shock waves in the media--but only one major media source has picked the story up: the Sydney Morning Herald (Australia). 

What the f#ck is going on here? The news is OUT--but the major media seem to be refusing to reprint or follow-up on the story...Did anyone even ask POTUS, the Pentagon or the CIA about the article on Monday?

<TEXT> Wm. Casey was supposed to meet up with a commission looking into the records of JFK right before he died...the film states Casey spoke with Congress 32 times--way more than any previous director of CIA...

I linked an article which delves into Casey's death further--pretty good read...I stayed away from posting Casey's links to the Phoenix program in Vietnam (and other controversial aspects of his career).

It should also be noted who took Casey's place in the CIA: GHW Bush. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's actually easier to read that way...

As for the post...I started watching this doc from 1992 a few days ago [**THE PANAMA DECEPTION**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo6yVNWcGCo) which starts out by pointing out how slanted the US media was towards the US invasion of Panama...really shocking to see how brainwashed we are to have believed the US media for so long--"a free press"...i've come to realize maybe the media in Russia is less dangerous than the US media--at least the Russians question everything their spin machine churns out...while here in the US, most Americans just see a report on TV and accept the "official US version" of events (even when the lie is exposed a day or two later).

I assembled a few other facts--mostly about Pakistan, that I found interesting: 

---------

**STRANGE** that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL's location. 

**STRANGE** that the U.S. gave [Military Aid to Pakistan](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/pakaid.pdf)--over $30 Billion since 9/11. 

**STRANGE** that [Porter Goss and Bob Graham](http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/03/17/the-911-joint-congressional-inquiry-and-28-missing-pages/) were with the head of the Pakistan's ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC

**STRANGE** that the head of Pakistan's ISI quit about a week after 9/11 because a newspaper from India published an [article outing him as having sent the 9/11 hijackers money](http://www.propagandamatrix.com/india_helped_fbi_trace_isi_terrorist_links.htm)

...but most folks don't remember all that.

<TEXT> Former NSA Insiders Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) wrote an open letter to POTUS in January, 2014...

------------------

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1]

<TEXT> Can't believe no one watched this--apparently the Ugly known unknown is too dark a path for Americans to face. I was surprised when I heard Errol Morris was doing this doc; but then Rumsfeld is such a close clone of Robert McNamara its quite scary--so the film was basically a Part II to *Fog of War*. 

I think Errol Morris is a talented film maker but is extremely misguided in allowing the two War Criminals such a soft, dreamy setting to say their Final Peace. McNamara liked to play with numbers, Rumsfeld tittillates himself with words--but they both enriched themselves by waging war against countries which never threatened U.S. mainland soil. 

Errol Morris dedicating the film to Roger Ebert, who pushed Hollywood escapism (American propaganda) onto Americans for decades, was a fitting ending. </TEXT>

-----

Jan. 5, 1961: At the last, Dwight Eisenhower exploded in anger and frustration. "The structure of our intelligence organization is faulty," he told Allen Dulles. It makes no sense, it has to be reorganized, and we should have done it long ago. Nothing had changed since Pearl Harbor. "I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this," said the President of the United States. He said he would "leave a legacy of ashes" to his successor.

"This spreadsheet is all the corporate fines/settlements Ive been able to find sourced articles about, mostly in the period from the 1990s up to today (with a few 80s and 70s). This is by far the most comprehensive list of such things online. At least that I could find, because the lack of any decent list is what made me start compiling this list in the first place.        

What struck me was the sheer number of corporate violations of laws and regulationsthousands upon thousands, the vast majority of which occurred since corporate profits began their incredible ascent in the early 2000sand the list of those paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and settlements, which reads like a whos who of Corporate America and Top 100 Global Corporations.

Many have a long list of fines and settlements, and many of the fines are in excess of $100 million. Many are for blatant cartel price-fixing, not disclosing the dangers of the companys heavily promoted medications, destroying documents to thwart an investigation of wrong-doing, etc."

<TEXT> Thomas Drake (et al.) wrote this in January, 2014:

------------------

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

<TEXT> Just watched this interview Michel Chossudovsky did with James Corbett--he made some comments on the media:

---------------

"We are dealing with a media apparatus which turns realities upside-down...presents the western quest and military adventure as a peace making undertaking...which lies in regards to the casualties of war...which presents the war criminals as protagonists of human rights...and that in itself is the pinnacle of this system.

Without the Main Stream Media and war propaganda this New World Order agenda doesn't have a leg to stand on. In other words, without these media lies the military agenda, the economic agenda would collapse like a deck of cards. And that is why it is absolutely fundamental that--within the realm of independent media and alternative media--**we wage a war against the main stream media**."

<TEXT> Makes me think of when I was young and ABC news decided to begin a late-night news program: *NIGHTLINE*. The purpose was to update Americans on the U.S. Hostage Situation in Iran. Every day the news media counted off how many days the situation had gone on: DAY 100...DAY 200...DAY 300...DAY 400...the number was on the Front Page of the newspaper and included in every newscast--the nation was at a fever pitch.

But NOT ONCE do I remember any newspaper or news program mentioning that the Hostage Situation was BLOWBACK for what the U.S. did in 1953 when the CIA helped to Overthrow Iran's government.

I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't used as a template for study within the Pentagon-CIA...How easy it is to get an entire nation to HATE. 

We know the Pentagon-CIA work with Hollywood and the "news" media--what if CNN and Fox "news" were actually created *from the very beginning* with input from the CIA-Pentagon? If they do it with movies--why not extend the reach and do it with cable news? </TEXT>

"When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book."

Bremer and 1,700 of the employees of Marsh   McLennan had offices in the World Trade Center. Bremer's office was in the North Tower. In an interview with CNN after the September 11 attacks, he stated that their office was located "above where the second aircraft hit".[5]

<TEXT> Actually, the $40 million which the SSCI funded went entirely to CIA-approved attorneys--so they could splice, dice and redact the 6,400 page Torture Report down to 400 pages (which We, the Serfs could read). 

On the other hand, the 9/11 Commission had offices in a CIA managed building with a staff of 84 people which included attorneys and basic office staff. The 9/11 Commission was also placed under a strict time frame of 16 months--while the Torture Report Re-Write Team was given 4 years to complete the editing of a report which was already finished. (note: the 9/11 Commission was eventually given another $10 million and paid no rent for the office space in the CIA-managed building...cough cough)

With last year's revelation of the SSCI being spied upon by the CIA--I wonder if the CIA also spied on the 9/11 Commission. We do know, from an editorial the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairs wrote to the *New York Times*, that they accused the CIA and the White House of [**OBSTRUCTING THE INVESTIGATION**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Either over the winter or last fall, the U.S. media all started chirping the same story about Venezuela being a threat to the U.S.--which was laughable, so I posted the annual military budgets for each...but, YES, the U.S. thru the CIA and its Economic Hit Men have certainly manipulated and taken advantage of the countries in Central and South America. 

Now imagine Venezuela's problem but 1,000 times bigger--that's what we have in the U.S.--our politicians are bought by corporations, our laws are made by corporations and our wars are planned by WAR, INC. </TEXT>

After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book."

<TEXT> The U.S. has tried to overthrow Venezuela for quite a long time--could this fraud be just one more reason for the recent amping-up of the vilification of Venezuela? To be clear: I'm sure there most likely is drug dealing and corruption in Venezuela--but if Venezuela cut-off this Energy deal and threatened to expose the fraud, perhaps it has to do with the recent U.S. allegations? </TEXT>

The DIA didn't want Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer to inform Congressional investigators because they didn't want the investigators digging deeper into the project and asking what the project was designed to do. </TEXT>

I'm a truther , too...I think Bush/Cheney didn't want any suspects on U.S. soil because they knew they couldn't control the cover-up under normal U.S. court procedures. It's completely absurd that the 9/11 Commission was only initially given $3 million--yet the SSCI initially funded the Torture Report Re-write (in Dec. 2008) with $40 million off the bat. This was so CIA-approved attorneys could shred the Torture Report from 6,300 pages down to 400 pages.

And, Yes--it's definitely infuriating. </TEXT>

[**Four billion dollars per year is spent by the Pentagon on propaganda**](http://www.occupycorporatism.com/home/how-the-ndaa-allows-us-gov-to-use-propaganda-against-americans/) aimed at the American public; as well as $202 million spent by the Department of Defense on misinformation operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2011.

Currently, the Pentagon is using sock puppet  (fake handles) on social media sites to purvey false information, harass users and enact psy-ops to influence Americans.

A California corporation is working with the US Central Command (CENTCOM) in spreading propaganda overseas. They provide online persona management service that allows active duty military to set up an estimated 10 different false identities that are used worldwide.

Each fake persona comes complete with a background history and safeties to prevent sophisticated adversaries from discovering the lie.

CENTCOM spokesman Commander Bill Speaks said: The technology supports classified blogging activities on foreign-language websites to enable CENTCOM to counter violent extremist and enemy propaganda outside the US.

Sophisticated software allows military to engage in online conversations with coordinated answers, blog comments and instant messaging remarks that are solely meant to spread pro-American propaganda.

<TEXT> I definitely agree that Americans have undersold the contributions (and massive suffering) which the Soviet Union contributed to defeating the Nazis in WWII. The first book I read from the Russian side was Antony Beevor's collection of Vasily Grossman's writing titled [**A WRITER AT WAR**](http://www.antonybeevor.com/index.php/previous-books/a-writer-at-war-vasily-grossman-with-the-red-army-1941-1945/).

I've also been looking into the root causes of the Cold War--which was much more a manufactured product than many Americans can wrap their heads around. Antony Sutton dug a bit too deep into Stanford's research collection and revealed that 90% of Soviet technology was derived from the West--certainly made the Establishment (aka the profiteers) uncomfortable. [**HERE'S**](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) a post I threw up about how the Cold War was largely manufactured by the CIA-Pentagon.

<TEXT> Harry Truman dropped 2 nukes on Japan--supposedly there would not be deaths due to radiation after the initial blast...More importantly, Truman signed the [National Security Act of 1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947) which renamed the WAR DEPARTMENT into a much more appealing Department of Defense. The National Security Act also created the CIA--which was supposed to be "an intelligence gathering arm of the President," but which turned into an out of control agency which some have pegged responsible (directly or indirectly) for up to 30 million deaths. The failure of Truman to control the drawdown of WWII eventually blew up to become what Eisenhower would call the Military Industrial Complex.

Harry Truman also created the [Truman Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine)--which threw the Cold War into high gear. The CIA brainiacs decided to give former nazi SS Eastern Front Intelligence Chief Reinhard Gehlen $5 million to start an intelligence agency in West Germany--this lead to many deaths in Eastern Europe as Gehlen's men were often double agents and even sold the CIA completely bunk information...Pay people millions of dollars--and they will tell you what you want to hear! The CIA has also infiltrated U.S. colleges/universities, but, most importantly, the MEDIA. Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Guatemala, Iran...etc...We are now sold wars on the basis of "spreading democracy"--and most Americans have no idea (or care) that there have been 3 million killed in the Middle East since 9/11. 

Even Truman's Marshall Plan (which was intended to help fund the rebuilding of 16 cities in Europe and Asia after WWII) indirectly was responsible for many deaths: The CIA pilfered at least 5% (about $600 million) of the $15+ Billion Marshall Plan to fund their dirty operations around the globe. The funds were diverted to buy mansions for station chiefs--but mostly to buy weapons and to act as political slush funds iaround the globe:  Greece, Italy, France--even Japan. NATO was formed in 1949--the CIA and the intelligence agencies of western Europe created Operation Gladio (insert many more deaths).

Astoundingly, Harry Truman was also indirectly responsible for the death of JFK--he even wrote an [editorial in the *Washington Post*](http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman%27s%20CIA%20article.html) which ran on 12-22-63. The editorial stated that the CIA was supposed to be an intelligence gathering arm of the President--not a runaway operations and dirty tricks squad.  Truman wrote: "For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas." cough cough.

Anyone who has read *Legacy of Ashes: A History of the CIA* knows that often it is not only the president who doesn't know what the CIA is doing--sometimes the director of the CIA doesn't even know all the different operations going on inside his own agency. The "War on Drugs" should also be thrown in--the CIA and the military have been connected to drug running and laundering of drug money from Vietnam to South America and, yes, even the Middle East...(Afghanistan's poppy yield in 2001 was virtually eliminated--today under U.S.-Taliban control it is the world's largest supply) </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Q**: How can we *know our own history* when so much of it is kept secret from us for decades? 

Some examples: 

+ Even much of the early funding for the CIA was kept secret from the public for about 50 years. The CIA pilfered at least 5% of the Marshall Plan funds--at least $680 million out of the $15 Billion+ which was supposed to go to rebuild 16 cities in Europe and Asia after WWII--instead went to fund CIA operations.

+ There are still plenty of WWII records NOT RELEASED--check Operation Paperclip...

+ Yale history professor Beverly Gage wrote a book in 2008 about the 1920 bombing of Wall Street--yet she couldn't get any files released about the event almost 90 years later...Gage wrote about this in the appendix to her book *The Day Wall Street Exploded*.

+ John Stockwell noted in the mid-80's that the Church investigations of the 70's had taken the time to count the number of CIA Operations--they found that in the first 25 years the CIA had run about 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations...

<TEXT> Last week Frontline proved what a waste of your time they are with a vacuous "investigation" of the Decade Old CIA-Pentagon Torture--there was absolutely nothing new in the Frontline report (except for a couple of scraps about the CIA feeding info to Hollywood...which we already knew). 

PBS/Frontline is following the TRAITORS of the entire corporate news cabal--the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX--they have all FAILED to investigate and print the TRUTH.  They have all sold their corporate souls and allowed the POTUS and the Pentagon to give them permission to print. Rather than defend the freedom of the press, these corporate prostitutes have settled for PROFITS over TRUTH. 

As we saw with James Risen's investigation of the Patriot Act--the NYT was all too willing to hold back the story for 18 months. It was only after Risen went out and got a book deal that the NYT finally printed his report (which won a Pulitzer). Even when these TRAITORS report on a story--you should know it is filled with Pentagon Propaganda and Half-Truths.

It is Useless to watch Frontline anymore--unless you want to expose yourself to the CIA-Pentagon Propaganda Wurlizter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Richard Belzer**: "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles."

<TEXT> the "shitty doc" you refer to used primarily Corporate news reports which have never been followed up on--what is wrong with continuing to ask questions when the USG and the intelligence agencies have so obviously stalled and obstructed the 9/11 investigations? Even the [**9/11 Commission Co-Chairs wrote a letter**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) to the *NYT* stating their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA. One former 9/11 Commission member was asked if we need another 9/11 Commission--he stated that "We need at least Fifteen 9/11 Commissions."

In *The Zapruder Film Mystery* Doug Horne, former chief analyst of military records at the Assassination Records Review Board--from the NATIONAL ARCHIVES actually has found several of the men who worked on the Zapruder film for the CIA over the weekend of 11-22-63. 

If all of you quit with your knee-jerk reactions you might actually learn something someday. I have a feeling you are too fucking brainwashed and think the USG is a benevolent association which bombs the world for democracy. Good Luck with that--someday our children will be paying for all these bullshit fucking wars (maybe us, too)...all of that may happen sooner than you think as the world switches off the PetroDollar--it may turn out our only friends only liked the U.S. because we had money and a gun pointed at them.

<TEXT> John Stockwell referred to the Church Committee investigation which counted CIA Operations between 1947-1972: 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations--every one of them secret, every one of them, by definition, a conspiracy. As the fucking CIA has now been around for almost 70 years--you can Triple these numbers: 27,000 small-scale operations and 9,000 large-scale operations which the public has virtually no information about. The files we are given access to are also heavily fucking redacted.

We know the CIA and the DoD are extremely secretive and extremely compartmentalized. During the Vietnam War, Daniel Ellsberg finally read the Pentagon Papers which clearly showed that the U.S. would have to commit 500K to 1 million soldiers to control South Vietnam--yet, this remained SECRET (even from the President) with only a few traitorous fucking generals knowing this info.

<TEXT> First of all: According to John Judge--the DIA is supposed to have 10X the budget of the CIA with 100X the manpower. The DARPA program is the fucking Boot Stomping on your Face that Orwell warned us about. 

There was a program in the 90's which was updated around 2000 and became DARPA. (I can't find the links--but cryptome has both of the reports on their site).

Before 9/11, the DoD (under which the DIA operates) ran an OPERATION DARKHEART which ID'd at least 4 of the 9/11 hijackers 16 months before 9/11 via "open source intelligence". I think DARKHEART was a TRIAL which was meant to be further refined and put in place once more funds became available after 9/11. 

The DoD cannot account for $8.5 TRILLION since 1996...It's also fucking scary that the DoD has no restraints when it comes to running OPS on Americans who are in the U.S.

I didn't watch the whole video--but knowing that the DoD and CIA regularly work in lockstep with Hollywood and the corporate news sycophants...this is just another step towards 100% Totalitarianism: a corporate-fascist state.

America has sold itself to corporate overlords...you own tax dollars have paid for this runaway train. All that's left to do now is to sit back and watch WWIII as the U.S. takes over using the 650 military bases on foreign soil to attempt to: 1) save the U.S. economy and; 2) control energy and other vital resources by plundering the countries under U.S. control...enjoy the show!!! </TEXT>

When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book. Excerpts:

--------------

Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.

The press began reporting possible Torture by the US in early 2002 (Feb. or March)--this could be leaked to STOP a hot story as well...

wikileaks, CIA torture, Snowden--they are all battles worth losing to cover up the Largest Crime ever on American soil...there have been NO budget cuts--and if there were the DoD can switch funds
easily (there are no audits)...no one was ever Fired from their jobs, either...

<TEXT> At the time, Cheney-Bush claimed it was "because we were at war and couldn't afford to distract resources". But, I think it was far more devious than that: 

1. [**Cheney-Bush asked Senator Tom Daschle NOT**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pTt2cQvUww) to have the Senate-House of Representatives Intelligence Committees Investigate (this was known as the "Joint Commission")

2. Cheney-Bush Stalled the formation of the 9/11 Commission and underfunded the Commission once it was finally formed--the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with only $3 million. For reference, the investigation of Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinski cost over $40 million...in 2008 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence funded the Torture Report with $40 million--this was to EDIT a 6,300 page report using only CIA-approved attorneys (not to write the report!). The 9/11 Commission would eventually receive about $14 million in total--about one-third of the cost of the Torture Report (Re-Write).

3. Cheney-Bush attempted to place Henry Kissinger (CIA-insider) as Commissioner of the 9/11 Commission. [**HK met with some of the victims' families**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmHPfXemf10) in his office--they asked him if his law firm would disclose a list of clients (to make sure there were no potential conflicts of interest). HK wouldn't disclose and turned the position down. 

4. The eventual Commissioner would be Lee Hamilton (and Thomas Kean)--who had served on the Iran-Contra hearings with (guess who?)...Dick Cheney...In 1989, after they successfully shut down the open Iran-Contra Hearings from revealing too much--Dick Cheney was awarded by the new president, GHW Bush (former CIA Director), with a nice step up: Secretary of Defense (even tho Cheney had taken 5 deferments during Vietnam)

5. The 9/11 Commission was given a tight timeframe: 16 months (compare that to the 4 years which the Torture Report rewrite was allowed). In addition, the 9/11 Commission office in DC was in a CIA managed building...(remember the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence scandal last year in which the CIA was SPYING on the SSCI)

5. The first thing Cheney did in office was to hold his secret Energy Task Force meetings--the ACLU and the press demanded to know info about the meetings but was denied. [**Eventually--2 years later**](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/07/18/cheney-energy-task-force-documents-detail-iraqi-oil-industry.html) the ACLU was able to get a few pages of their meeting released (one of the pages was a map of Iraqi oilfields along with what companies were under contract). Cheney and the CIA also planned for [**Regime Change in Iraq**](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) since the 90's...

6. During the 90's--after the fall of the USSR, the US defense and intelligence agencies were hurting from budget cuts and scandals--and, even  worse, could no longer yell "COMMIE!!!" and receive Billions. After GHW Bush left office, Cheney went to Halliburton--but one of Cheney's last acts as Sec. of Defense was to fund a study examining the potential for privatizing some functions of the DoD.

7. Ultimately, YES, 9/11 was a long-planned, super-compartmentalized DoD-CIA operation with a goal to give the US a new Super Villain and thereby revive the defense and intelligence sectors. For those who think hundreds or thousands had to know--that's BS--the CIA-DIA operates in extreme secrecy. In the mid-70's the Church Committee took a look at CIA operations: [**the CIA had run 9,000 small operations and 3,000 large operations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ioJGMCr-Y) between 1947-1972...every one of the operations was the definition of a conspiracy.

8. In addition, Cheney-Bush shut down the SEC investigation of the stock market profiteers who placed PUT options on United on 9/11. The Patriot Act was forced down the throats of Congress, [**the intelligence agencies**](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/) and the defense contractors expanded exponentially. Booz Allen (which the Carlyle Group would buy) even began getting millions of dollars in  September, 2001.

9. After the victims' families and the press finally pressured President Bush to testify before the 9/11 Commission, the President of the United States finally agreed...but only if it was NOT under oath, NOT in public and NO notes were taken...The President also demanded he be allowed to have Dick Cheney hold his hand, too. Bush-Cheney had screamed "9-11" from the rooftops on a daily basis--but couldn't even officially testify in public and on the record to the 9/11 Commission. As a bonus insult, Bush held a [**5-minute "press conference"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) afterwards in which only 6 questions were asked. Odd that C-Span has deleted the press conference--9/11 researcher Jon Gold posted it for us on youtube (otherwise we might not be able to see it). Please watch the "press conference" for yourself and note the words and body language--is this man telling us the full truth? Notice he can't even say he "testified" and has to say "I had a conversation" with...

--------------

EDIT:  what many of you are Failing to comprehend is that America is a CORPORATOCRACY--it is no longer a free republic and there is NO "democracy"...if you fill large office buildings with people and pay them six-figure salaries they will tell you what you want to hear...One example is the [**Cold War LIES**](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) that the USSR was ahead in nuclear capability--the Pentagon and CIA and the RAND corporation advised the President the Soviets had more missiles--when, in fact, the US was well ahead of the USSR. The [**DoD can't account for $8.5 TRILLION**](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)--yet every business, every citizen and every government agency is by law required to submit to an audit every year (except for the DoD and the Three Letter Agencies)...the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Congressional Corporate Complex will sure as hell do what it has to do in order to ensure the Billions upon Billions of dollars keep flowing.

Philip Zelikow's appearance is a punch to the bloody face of Lady Liberty as well. Zelikow had helped to WHITEWASH the 9/11 Commission as its executive director under the Co-Chairs Kean and Hamilton. For those that haven't read it--here's Glenn Greenwald's column after the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairs had written a *NYT* editorial stating the commission was [**OBSTRUCTED**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) by President Bush, Dick Cheney and the CIA. The "evidence" obtained via Torture must be considered invalid and inadmissible--the "evidence" must therefore be taken out of the 9/11 Commission Report.

<TEXT> I posted a [reuters article in r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/361vsa/banks_want_assurances_from_us_regulators_that/) and was surprised that: a) they let the post stay (i used the first sentence of the article as the headline of the post instead of the actual headline) and; b) that the post actually made it to #2 (currently at #4). 

I really don't care about karma points--but I do care about people seeing the gross inequality of what is happening.

There's also this excellent [article by Washington's Blog](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html) which describes some of the 6,300 settlements the corporations have been able to negotiate--most of them with no actual prosecution. Prosecution is importrant--when an average citizen is prosecuted for a small offense there is often probation, educational classes (etc.) and the convicted is held to a higher standard while under probation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I reposted it because the bankers have been "negotiating" their deals with the SEC.

I think it drives home the point: if you are a banker with millions to spend on fucking attorneys--HEY, no big deal...no one has to go to jail even though BILLIONS have been STOLEN from both the public and private traders which the companies handle deals for.

meanwhile, if you are poor and black or hispanic in the U.S.--you better watch the fuck out because you can be harassed/arrested/killed at any moment. </TEXT>

----------

In an unprecedented move, the parent companies or main banking units of JPMorgan Chase   Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L), Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.VX) are likely to plead guilty to rigging foreign exchange rates to benefit their transactions.

The banks are also scrambling to line up exemptions or waivers from the Securities and Exchanges Commission and other federal regulators because criminal pleas trigger consequences such as removing the ability to manage retirement plans or raise capital easily.

In the past, waivers have generally been granted without a hitch. However, the practice has become controversial in the past year, particularly at the SEC, where Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein has criticized the agency for rubber stamping requests and being too soft on repeat offenders.

**Negotiating some of the waivers among the SEC's five commissioners could prove challenging because many of these banks have broken criminal or civil laws in the past that triggered the need for waivers**.

Many of the banks want an SEC waiver to continue operating as "well-known seasoned issuers" so they can sell stocks and debt efficiently, people familiar with the matter said. Such a designation allows public companies to bypass SEC approval and raise capital "off the shelf" - a process that is speedier and more convenient.

Several of the people said another waiver being sought by some banks is the ability to retain a safe harbor that shields them from class action lawsuits when they make forward-looking statements.

The banks involved are also seeking waivers that will allow them to continue operating in the mutual fund business, sources said.

At least some of the waivers at issue in the forex probe will need to be put to a vote by the SEC's five commissioners. No date has been set yet, a few of the people familiar with the matter said.

The plea deals could be announced as soon as next week, two of the people said, adding that not all the penalties had been finalized yet.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, declined comment on the timing or reason for a possible delay of any agreements. Citi, JPMorgan, RBS and UBS did not respond to requests for comment. A Barclays spokesman declined to comment.

The Justice Department has been negotiating with the banks for months over how to resolve allegations that **traders colluded to rig rates in the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market**.

If the parent companies of U.S.-based JPMorgan and Citigroup plead guilty as planned, it would be the first time in decades that a major American financial institution has done so.

Last year, when Swiss bank Credit Suisse AG (CSGN.VX) pleaded guilty in the United States to helping wealthy Americans evade taxes, it became the largest institution in over 20 years to admit criminal wrongdoing. It was soon followed by French banking group BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA).

Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday night that the U.S. Justice Department voided a 2012 settlement with UBS related to interest-rate rigging.

**Citing current and former government officials, it said the negotiations were expected to result in deals next week in which UBS would pay a fine of about $200 million and plead guilty to allegations that its traders manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, before 2012**.

<TEXT> Imagine that: **delays and obstructions of congressional investigations**

--------------

(from article) In 1991, Congress began an investigation into the 1980 issue, suspecting that it may have been a prequel to the Iran-Contra scandal which had involved Reagans secret arms-for-hostage deals with Iran in 1985-86 (also with Israeli help). The George H.W. Bush administration collected documents possibly related to the 1980 events and shared some with the congressional investigation, including the Haig talking points.

But Bushs operatives  trying to protect his reelection chances in 1991-92  engaged in **delays and obstructions of the congressional inquiry**, which finally agreed after Bushs defeat by Bill Clinton in November 1992 to say that it could find no credible evidence that Reagan and Bush had orchestrated a delay in Irans release of the hostages. The hostages were finally freed on Jan. 20, 1981, immediately after Reagan was sworn in as president.

(quotes from book)----------

Cover photograph by Dennis Rolfe shows a typewriter and bugged case planted on the author presumably by the CIA.

---------------

(forward by Patrick Breslin) After a stint as an Air Force officer (for cover) and CIA training, Agee arrived in Quito, Ecuador in late 1960. During the glory years of the Alliance for Progress and the New Frontier, he fought the holy war against communism by bribing politicians and journalists, forging documents, tapping telephones, and reading other people's mail.

But it was a faraway event which seems to have disturbed him more. Lyndon Johnson's invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965 was an overreaction Agee couldn't accept. In 1968, he resigned with the conviction that he had become a "servant of the capitalism I rejected" as a university student"one of its secret policemen."

--------

(begin Philip Agee) When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book.

--------------

Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.

----------------

I grabbed a sandwich at a blind stand and then took the shuttle to the Executive Office Building. (Those blind standssandwich bars operated by blind peopleare in practically every building. I guess it's a good thing for the blind people to have that work, and the company can let them in the buildings because they can't read secret papers. Everybody wins.)

------------------

The interrogator announced that I had reached the final phase of the security clearance procedure necessary for access to Top Secret material and, of course, for employment with the company. He assured me that all employees of the company, even Mr. Dulles, submit to the polygraphnot just once when they're hired, but periodically throughout their careers.

<TEXT> Synchronicity is always good. Do you remember when Bush-Cheney first got into office and Cheney was being so secretive about the Energy Commission? After a year or two a few pages of what they were working on finally came out thru a FOIA lawsuit--one of the only pages which was released was an analysis of Iraq's oil/gas fields. 

Another thing that I think may have happened is the U.S. most likely had Iraq sign up to supply U.S. forces with gas/oil as part of the security agreement to have U.S.-led forces remain there. 

I would think Iran is off the PetroDollar. The PetroDollar is why the U.S.-NATO took out Gaddafi, too. Now look at what a mess Libya has been since. 

China and Russia have signed agreements to use their own currencies in energy deals. China's President was in Moscow over the weekend with Putin for the 70th of VE Day--most likely forging deeper military and economic ties.

To be clear--Porter Goss was formerly the head of the CIA and must be cleared by the government to work as a lobbyist for another country. Turkey has also been leasing drones from the U.S. for years (you can read the U.S. State Dept. memos on wikileaks) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The decline of the PetroDollar could be why the U.S. is so hungry to overthrow Syria. At this point I'm sure there's much of the infrastructure there that needs to be rebuilt. I also think the thought of a pipeline going from Iran-Iraq-Syria is seen as threatening to corporate America (et al.). 

Rumor is Turkey along with the Saudis are amping things up to take care of Syria--and former CIA director Porter Goss just asked for permission to be a "lobbyist" for Turkey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fall of 2000, Saddam Hussein took Iraq off the PetroDollar in the Oil-for-Food program (he switched to the Euro). Alternatively, [Scott Ritter](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) claims the U.S. was out for regime change in Iraq after the Gulf War ended--so the PetroDollar may have just been Saddam's final middle finger gesture to a determined pack of neoCons.

The info likely is spread upwards into the official government lists--to be used when convenient. We know the FBI-NSA spied on peace activists in the 60's. They also spied on U.S. politicians, journalists and high profile figures. Among the politicians was Sen. Frank Church--who was on the Intelligence Committee looking into the abuses of the FBI-NSA. This was only revealed in 2013.

<TEXT> For example, at Stalingrad: 

------------

The Axis suffered 850,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies; 400,000 Germans, 200,000 Romanians, 130,000 Italians, and 120,000 Hungarians were killed, wounded or captured.[95]

On the material side, the Germans losses were 900 aircraft (including 274 transports and 165 bombers used as transports), 500 tanks, and 6,000 artillery pieces.[2]:122123 According to a contemporary Soviet report, 5,762 artillery pieces; 1,312 mortars; 12,701 heavy machine guns; 156,987 rifles; 80,438 sub-machine guns; 10,722 trucks; 744 aircraft; 1,666 tanks; 261 other armored vehicles; 571 half-tracks; and 10,679 motorcycles were captured by the Soviets.[96] An unknown amount of Hungarian, Italian, and Romanian material was lost.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad

Kursk: 

---------


Karl-Heinz Frieser, who reviewed the German archive record, calculated that during Operation Citadel 54,182 casualties were suffered. Of these, 9,036 were killed, 1,960 were reported missing, and 43,159 were wounded. The 9th Army suffered 23,345 casualties, while Army Group South suffered 30,837 casualties.[9] Throughout the Soviet offensives, 86,064 casualties were suffered. In facing Operation Kutuzov, 14,215 men were killed, 11,300 were reported missing (presumed killed or captured), and 60,549 were wounded.[295] During Polkovodets Rumyantsev, 25,068 casualties were incurred, including 8,933 killed and missing. Total casualties for the three battles were about 170,000 men.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk

----------

Moscow:

-----------

Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Not all historians agree on what should be considered the "Battle of Moscow" in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation Typhoon on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2 October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive. In particular, some sources (such as Erickson[82] and Glantz[83]) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive "stop" on 7 January 1942thus lowering the number of casualties.

There are also significant differences in figures from various sources. John Erickson, in his Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies, gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942.[82] Glantz, in his book When Titans Clashed, gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7 January 1942.[83] The estimate of 400,000 German casualties by January 1942 reported in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, published in 197378.[70] On the other hand, Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Center between 1 October 1941 and 10 January 1942.[84]

Regardless of these disagreements, the Battle of Moscow is considered among the most lethal battles in world history.

<TEXT> Thanks for the thoughtful feedback--I think you're definitely right about the USG primarily serving the upper class. The only book I've read so far that has exposed me to the history of socialist thought in the US was by Beverly Gage, titled *The Day Wall Street Exploded*. Gage is a Yale history professor and gave some backstory of the socialist movement in the US as she proceeded to tell the story of the [Wall Street Bombing of 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing). 

I found her categorization to be a little dismissive of the possibility that the US industrialists had ostracized the socialists because they were attempting to keep the unions from demanding higher wages (etc.). 

One of the most interesting aspects of the book was that she was unable to get the USG to release any files--even though the incident happened in 1920. She provided an appendix with notes on sources in which she expressed frustration.

It does seem like the US population is beginning to understand we are being misled--hopefully the Chris Hedges of the world will have a farther-reaching voice very soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html). If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.

The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with [no audit necessary](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2)--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties. Every taxpayer, business, and government agency in America is supposed to be able to pass a financial audit by the feds, every year. Its the law, so we do our duty. Theres one exception: the Pentagon--which is even so bold as to announce it has misplaced [TRILLIONS](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget) of dollars.

The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?

The USG allows our law enforcement to [jail millions](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/13/wonkbook-11-facts-about-americas-prison-population). They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it.

The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about [100 countries right now](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-us-has-military-personnel-130-nation/). Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?

The [USG also wages economic warfare against other countries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-a6jzU0YgQ) which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. 
We do not need to [overthrow other governments](http://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list)--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.

The [USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases](http://www.rawstory.com/2013/05/authorization-for-use-of-military-force-a-blank-check-for-war-without-end/) and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. I wish most of our soldiers were employed out of the military--building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure in the U.S (and around the globe--HELPING people).

The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...

FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the [Joint Intelligence Committee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0) and the [9/11 Commission](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup). Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were [obstructed](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world). GW Bush couldn't even testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission--he held a [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) press conference afterwards.

I do love America--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?

I seriously FEAR that WAR, INC will take things too far--and the Corporate Perpetual War may very well end up in [WWIII](http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/04/15/will-washington-kill-us-paul-craig-roberts/). </TEXT>

I still think its a somewhat useful observation because of the vast cultural differences between the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. has hundreds of years of embedded racial inequality and a much more diverse population which has, until recently, not been allowed to be seen as equals.

I see the statement as an exercise in how countries misjudge what they can control when they invade another country.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> another GREAT article by PCR--here's the Meat of it (but I would urge you to read the entire article--especially the MLK quote at the end!)


------------

...in the cop culture that is America today, the Bill of Rights doesnt amount to much. Unless, that is, its the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR), which protects police officers from being subjected to the kinds of debilitating indignities heaped upon the average citizen.

Most Americans, oblivious about their own rights, arent even aware that police officers have their own Bill of Rights. Yet at the same time that our own protections against government abuses have been reduced to little more than historic window dressing, 14 states have already adopted LEOBoRswritten by police unions and being considered by many more states and Congresswhich provides police officers accused of a crime with special due process rights and privileges not afforded to the average citizen.

In other words, the LEOBoR protects police officers from being treated as we are treated during criminal investigations: questioned unmercifully for hours on end, harassed, harangued, browbeaten, denied food, water and bathroom breaks, subjected to hostile interrogations, and left in the dark about our accusers and any charges and evidence against us.

Not only are officers given a 10-day cooling-off period during which they cannot be forced to make any statements about the incident, but when they are questioned, it must be for a reasonable length of time, at a reasonable hour, by only one or two investigators (who must be fellow policemen), and with plenty of breaks for food and water.

According to investigative journalist Eli Hager, the most common rights afforded police officers accused of wrongdoing are as follows:

* If a department decides to pursue a complaint against an officer, the department must notify the officer and his union.
* The officer must be informed of the complainants, and their testimony against him, before he is questioned.
* During questioning, investigators may not harass, threaten, or promise rewards to the officer, as interrogators not infrequently do to civilian suspects.
* Bathroom breaks are assured during questioning.
* In Maryland, the officer may appeal his case to a hearing board, whose decision is binding, before a final decision has been made by his superiors about his discipline. The hearing board consists of three of the suspected offenders fellow officers.
* In some jurisdictions, the officer may not be disciplined if more than a certain number of days (often 100) have passed since his alleged misconduct, which limits the time for investigation.
* Even if the officer is suspended, the department must continue to pay salary and benefits, as well as the cost of the officers attorney.

...in the cop culture that is America today, the Bill of Rights doesnt amount to much. Unless, that is, its the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR), which protects police officers from being subjected to the kinds of debilitating indignities heaped upon the average citizen.

Most Americans, oblivious about their own rights, arent even aware that police officers have their own Bill of Rights. Yet at the same time that our own protections against government abuses have been reduced to little more than historic window dressing, 14 states have already adopted LEOBoRswritten by police unions and being considered by many more states and Congresswhich provides police officers accused of a crime with special due process rights and privileges not afforded to the average citizen.

In other words, the LEOBoR protects police officers from being treated as we are treated during criminal investigations: questioned unmercifully for hours on end, harassed, harangued, browbeaten, denied food, water and bathroom breaks, subjected to hostile interrogations, and left in the dark about our accusers and any charges and evidence against us.

Not only are officers given a 10-day cooling-off period during which they cannot be forced to make any statements about the incident, but when they are questioned, it must be for a reasonable length of time, at a reasonable hour, by only one or two investigators (who must be fellow policemen), and with plenty of breaks for food and water.

According to investigative journalist Eli Hager, the most common rights afforded police officers accused of wrongdoing are as follows:

* If a department decides to pursue a complaint against an officer, the department must notify the officer and his union.
* The officer must be informed of the complainants, and their testimony against him, before he is questioned.
* During questioning, investigators may not harass, threaten, or promise rewards to the officer, as interrogators not infrequently do to civilian suspects.
* Bathroom breaks are assured during questioning.
* In Maryland, the officer may appeal his case to a hearing board, whose decision is binding, before a final decision has been made by his superiors about his discipline. The hearing board consists of three of the suspected offenders fellow officers.
* In some jurisdictions, the officer may not be disciplined if more than a certain number of days (often 100) have passed since his alleged misconduct, which limits the time for investigation.
* Even if the officer is suspended, the department must continue to pay salary and benefits, as well as the cost of the officers attorney.

the CIA-Pentagon KNEW they had to CREATE AN ENEMY--otherwise the Defense Budget would continue to SHRINK.

So in 1997...PNAC was formed...Blackwater USA was founded...plans for 9/11 were refined

Operation Darkheart (1999-2000) was an experiment, a CASE STUDY--to be used post-9/11

All they had to do was STEAL the Election. </TEXT>

<TEXT> SYNTHETIC TERROR SCAM: 

------------------

Late Sept. 2001...the U.S. sends in the CIA to Afghanistan to find UBL...CIA pays Afghan warlords millions--but can't find UBL...U.S. Congress approves initial $50 Billion for military...

Dec. 2002: U.S. funds the 9/11 Commission with an initial $3 million (another $10 million will be added in 2004)...U.S. spends $150 million on Guantanamo prison in 2002...

2002-2011: The U.S. gives Pakistan $3 Billion a year in military aid for 10 years ($30 Billion total)

May 2011: U.S. raids a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan to find UBL--they kill UBL and dump body in ocean

In total, the U.S. has spent over $4 TRILLION in Afghanistan and Iraq to find UBL and his circle who helped plan 9/11...so if there were 100 who planned 9/11, then it cost the U.S. $40 Billion to capture or kill each Al Qaeda member who helped UBL plan the 9/11 attacks.

$40 BILLION to capture/kill each of the top 100 Al Qaeda members who planned 9/11.

<TEXT> Nice essay...so sad that Americans would rather continue watching fictitious CSI shows (along with 100's of hours of useless sports per year) than actually ask questions about the most horrendous crime in our lifetimes. Even more appalling is their insistence on harshly criticizing those who do question the Official Story. 

Americans have an unexhaustible belief their government is good--Uncle Sam would never LIE to them. They have bought into the "Land of the Free" propaganda which they have been indoctrinated with by July 4th fireworks and forced daily childhood readings of the Pledge of Allegiance. 

In my lifetime, this Good Government Goo-Goo Crap was exposed during the Iran-Contra hearings--the CIA caught *in flagrante*, yet everything just went behind closed doors. Most of the country knew there was mass criminality--but the "Free Press" and the brainwashed population just gave it a YAWN like it was the end of a 3 1/2 hour movie.

<TEXT> add to that the recent anonymous admission by a Florida officer that cops regularly LIE and PLANT EVIDENCE to frame people:

--------------

Jeffery Schultz: You mentioned specifically implicating a black person. Does your agency target based on race?

Deputy Sheriff: I wouldnt say target based on race but is is, you know, um, it is much easier to do this on a black person because they have no credibility anyways. The charges stick better to blacks than to a rich white guy that can afford a lawyer. That is one school of thought. Then you still have the deputies who like doing it to the rich white guys because they say it removes the smug look from their faces. They get their kicks from the power like its a game. Most cops though, they, um do it to get bad guys off the streets. The last group of deputies do it for personal gain.

Jeffery Schultz: Personal gain? Like what?

Deputy Sheriff: Sometimes a deputy will use the threat of planting, you know, dope on a person to get some cash or something from the perp. Uh, like a few hundred bucks can make the problem go away. Its pretty rare but it happens. Usually its the deputies that live large and need supplemental income. They tend to keep it really quiet because thats like, you know, really bad stuff. We even had a guy put the suspect in the back of his green and white [patrol car]to drive him to an ATM machine. We were all like what the hell is he doing? And another time a deputy arrested a guy for possession after he said he found the baggie on the guys floor board. Then he, um, he didnt charge the guy in exchange for oral sex from the guys wife. I thought that was, you know, really wrong. Taking things just too far. Way to far. But I kept my mouth shut because, you know, you cross that line even a little and you dont have the right to complain about those crossing it a bit more.

---------------------

Jeffery Schultz: How does this Sheriff keep his job? Dont the people in your county become outraged?

Deputy Sheriff: The people in our county wear blinders. They dont care what we do or if deputies are planting evidence as long as they keep believing the lie their crime is going down and they are protected. They only care about themselves and pretty much, that is fine with us. We get some of the highest salaries in the country, incredible benefits and cars that we can use for our personal use any time we want. No matter how bad our deputies think Sheriff Bradshaw is, money talks and as long as it keeps flowing into our bank accounts, we arent going to make any waves. And um, it is quite the opposite. Almost every civilian employee of the Sheriffs Office who voluntarily worked on the Sheriffs campaign got a nice, shiny unmarked county take home car they use when ever they want and gas paid for by the tax payer. Were talking like 150 cars or something completely obscene like that. Who is going to want that to go away

In the course of our investigation into the national response to the attacks, the 9/11 Commission staff discovered that the official version of what had occurred [the morning of September 11, 2001]  that is, what government and military officials had told Congress, the Commission, the media, and the public about who knew what when was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue. 

--John Farmer, The Ground Truth: The Story Behind Americas Defense on 9/11, (New York: The Penguin Group, 2009), p. 2.

--------


If the war on terror is real then the first thing that would have happened within a matter of weeks after 9/11 would have been we'd have closed the borders off. You have no national security if your borders are not secure...The official story of 9/11 is the dog that doesnt hunt.

 -- Col. Ronald D. Ray, U.S. Marine Corps (ret) and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense under the Reagan Administration
http://www.propagandamatrix.com/articles/july2006/010706doesnthunt.htm

-----------

Scholars and professionals . . . have established beyond any reasonable doubt that the official account of 9/11 is false and that, therefore, the official 'investigations' have really been cover-up operations. 

-- Lt. Col. Robert Bowman, PhD, U.S. Air Force (ret)
http://patriotsquestion911.com/

------------

Your countrymen have been murdered and the more you delve into it the more it looks as though they were murdered by our government, who used it as an excuse to murder other people thousands of miles away. 

-- Lt. Col. Shelton F. Lankford, U.S. Marine Corps (ret)
http://patriotsquestion911.com/

--------------

I am 100% convinced that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were planned, organized, and committed by treasonous perpetrators that have infiltrated the highest levels of our government ....Those of us in the military took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic...it is our duty to expose the real perpetrators of 9/11 and bring them to justice, no matter how hard it is, how long it takes, or how much we have to suffer to do it. We owe it to those who have gone before us who executed that same oath, and who are doing the same thing in Iraq and Afghanistan right now. Those of us who joined the military and faithfully executed orders that were given us had to trust our leaders. The violation and abuse of that trust is not only heinous, but ultimately the most accurate definition of treason! 

-- Lt. Colonel Guy S. Razer, U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, and former instructor at the USAF Fighter Weapons School
http://patriotsquestion911.com/#Razer

------------

It is as a scientist that I have the most trouble with the official government conspiracy theory, mainly because it does not satisfy the rules of probability or physics. 

-- Lt. Col. Karen U. Kwiatkowski, PhD, U.S. Air Force (ret)
http://patriotsquestion911.com/

----------

When one starts using his own mind, and not what one was told, there is very little to believe in the official story...[I] have experience flying low altitude, high speed aircraft. I could not have done what these beginners did. Something stinks to high heaven! 

-- U.S. Navy Top Gun pilot Commander Ralph Kolstad

"Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, **until some other adversary could be invented**. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

--George F. Kennan in preface to Norman Cousins' book *The Pathology of Power* (1987). Kennan was awarded the *Presidential Medal of Freedom* in 1989 by GHW Bush.

"It is the function of the CIA to keep the world unstable, and to propagandize and teach the American people to hate and fear, so we will let the Establishment spend any amount of money on arms.

The US defenses were lowered by having so many War Games being run on 9/11...Fighter jets were scrambled 100 miles away from DC instead of over DC.

An embassy official in the Middle East turned down several Saudis from being allowed entry into the US--the CIA overruled him and forced him to OK their entry visas.

<TEXT> You could be right about the Israelis--but I think for the 9/11 Operation to be successful the US had to have it's guard down and there had to be someone inside making sure the Cover Ups worked. 

I think the US set it up using the CIA or the Pentagon to do it...the Saudis helped find the patsies (the hijackers), the Saudis and the Pakistanis helped fund it (wasn't very expensive)...and the Israelis set up the WTC...

But most of that $4 Trillion just went to make rich men even Richer.

<TEXT> There is no direct evidence that the USG had direct links, BUT...what do Criminals do? They hide evidence, they try to disrupt the investigation...

Footage from 89 security cameras was immediately confiscated from around the Pentagon by the FBI...Still, to this day, the USG has only released 3 frames of footage. (what are they hiding--its 14 years later).

9/11 Commission: [Our Investigation Was Obstructed](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/)

Sen. Tom Daschle: [Cheney Asked Me NOT To Investigate 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)

It also took more than 400 days--and pressure from the victims' families, before the 9/11 Commission was allowed to proceed.

Criminals also try to stay out of the spotlight--which is why Bush would NOT speak to the 9/11 Commission in public--or UNDER OATH...what is so hard about putting your hand on the bible and swearing TO TELL THE TRUTH?

At 1hr 12 minutes of the *9/11 Exposed* documentary Rudy Giuliani states: "There were fires of 2000 degrees fahrenheit below the ground." (The source was nbc/today show)

At about 1hr 26min Gov. Pataki states the concrete was pulverized (fox news with bill hummer) </TEXT>

"Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, **until some other adversary could be invented**. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

--George F. Kennan in preface to Norman Cousins' book *The Pathology of Power* (1987). Kennan was awarded the *Presidential Medal of Freedom* in 1989 by GHW Bush.

<TEXT> Russ Baker is actually quite conservative in his investigative reporting--that is, his research is generally very meticulous. He strains not to make any gross leaps of judgment, building fact-upon-fact and clearly notifying the reader when he does attempt to fill in the blanks. Most important in all this is the sources--the interviews he personally made for the book and the extensive list of books/articles which he cites. 

If your personal background has been very trusting of the government (and the republicans-CIA) the book can definitely have some shock to it. If you read something in there you question, then read the sources for the chapter in the back of the book. 

*Family of Secrets* is actually quite conservative compared to [Webster Tarpley's earlier book on GHW Bush](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2culc7/ghw_bush_unauthorized_by_webster_tarpley/). It was actually the first book I read about politics, too--I have moved on and now have read quite a handful of authors and can judge what level of trust I can have in their words by comparing it to other books and sources.

Hopefully you will keep reading more books and learn what level of confidence you can place upon different authors as well--but the Source (the document or testimony) is always the most important aspect to analyze. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the failure of the corporate press has much more to do with the cozy relationship which developed during WWII. The US press became subservient to the military during the war--the relationship between the OSS/CIA/FBI became interlocked. The agencies began to demand the press hold stories and omit facts. NBC was owned by RCA--which produced radio equipment the soldiers/pilots used.

During the Gulf and Iraq Wars this became more pronounced due to the Billions the Pentagon was spending on advertising to get more recruits. The corporations completely lost their will to be the Fourth Estate and gave up their right to a Free Press. The corporate press no longer print stories--they check with the DoJ or the State Dept first, then they print (or not) after the USG has ok'd the article. 

I think it has become almost worse than the propaganda Russia often feeds its citizens because, as it is now, the citizens of the US THINK they are being fed the TRUTH--when its actually just press releases from the State Dept or the Pentagon. </TEXT>

I've never looked into whether this doc is fake or not--but Oswald being CIA seems beyond doubt. His work at Atsugi AFB in Japan required a high level clearance because that is where the CIA's U2 spyplanes were flown out of...Oswald affording the money to go to the USSR via Europe...Oswald renouncing his citizenship, then 18 months later coming back to the U.S. with a ticket for him, his new wife and his newborn--all paid for by the U.S. State Department--highly unusual to say the least...Oswald NOT being immediately arrested by the FBI upon return from the USSR...Oswald with George de Mohrenschildt (CIA) as a handler (his address is in Oswald's address book)...Oswald working at a High Security photo lab upon return (????-Stovall)...Oswald being seen with David Atlee Phillips (CIA-Latin America) by Antonio Veciana (he finally ID'd David Atlee Phillips before his death)...

Much of this is covered in these articles:

<TEXT> I fully agree with you that Obama has been quite vicious--definitely not the peacemaker everyone thought they were voting for!!! Over 1,000 drone strikes--not exactly anything Martin Luther King, Jr. would approve of. Obama used to quote him often--but obviously forgot all about his "Beyond Vietnam" speech.

80,000 deaths in Pakistan since 2001 (even though we are not at war with them). You're definitely right about Libya, too--another country turned to chaos just because Gaddafi was switching off the PetroDollar. 

I think Syria has a lot to do with stopping a possible Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline. 210,000 deaths in Syria since 2010.

I no longer see this as entirely a republican-democrat problem--it seems the CIA-Pentagon get their wars one way or the other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Short Answer: Oswald was set up by the CIA to be the Patsy--to take the fall. Many think Oswald worked for the CIA when he defected to the USSR in the late 50's. When Oswald came back to the U.S., the State Department paid his airfare--quite odd considering he was a defector (but not so odd if he was CIA)!  Then he passed out pro-Castro leaflets in New Orleans and was recorded by a tv station getting in a fight with anti-Castro Cubans (most likely a staged event).  All of these layers made him the perfect Fall Guy, some even think the CIA/Pentagon wanted to go to war with Cuba and get revenge for the Bay of Pigs (Oswald's commie background seemed to fit this possibility). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The chemical/bio weapons Saddam had were EXPIRED--no longer usable (they have a short shelf life)...Saddam was truly evil--but that didn't keep Donald Rumsfeld from shaking his hand just a year or so after he had gassed the Kurds. 

At least we agree that there were no terrorists in Iraq before the U.S. went in and created chaos. ISIS has a large percentage of Saddam's Ba'ath party and the Iraqi Army (which the U.S. broke up). I think one U.S. general even said what a huge mistake it was at the time...

The most recent death count in the Middle East is 3 million killed since 9/11 (includes Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Yemen).

Yet the republicans still want to bomb Iran--I guess they haven't made enough money off their WAR, INC stocks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would definitely say a mixture of all 3. we know the police unions lobby for laws to be written in certain ways...we know cops plant evidence and lie in reports...and we know the worst of them become outright criminals...

the cops will not testify or arrest other cops--and whatever drums up business and puts cash in the city/county/state coffers is a.o.k.

the CIA/DoD is on a much larger level--you basically have tens of thousands of the brightest minds in the Pentagon-CIA and think tanks with humongous sums of money to spend to drum up more villains and more war.  the dangerous part is that these people all have a similar world view (they are in the military or have been vetted and then hired only if they are acceptable). </TEXT>

Thomas Walker was a notorious slave trader active in the late 18th century along the coast of West Africa.

Walker, George H.W. Bush's great-great-great grandfather, was the captain of, master of, or investor in at least 11 slaving voyages to West Africa between 1784 and 1792.

<TEXT> that was a curveball that bent my mind a bit at first, too...but when you have a CIA guy stating on camera they did do body switches--it adds a little traction...The documentary's final breakdown of the JFK assassination is pretty out-of-the-box as well...

also interesting to me are the 2 trucks parked at the corner which may have been used as [Communication and Control Centers](http://www.jfkassassinationgallery.com/albums/userpics/10001/Towner1_Life_1967.jpg) which Jim Fetzer pointed out.

After going to WAR in Afghanistan and Iraq--why couldn't President Bush testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission? 

Even more outrageous is the [5 minute press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) he held afterwards in which there weren't even 6 questions asked. Bush had made 9/11 the cornerstone of our entire foreign and domestic policy--yet he can't spend even 60 minutes answering questions about 9/11 before the public?

watch the 5 minute press conference (link above) for yourself--look at his body language and listen to his answers...important to note that Bushie-boy can't say he testified before the panel--because he wasn't even placed under oath.

also see:  http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2okmfy/gw_bushs_full_press_conference_after_speaking/

--------------

edit: also interesting that C-Span has taken down this press conference from their videos--go to C-Span and SEARCH for yourself...why would they hide a press conference of POTUS? also odd that I couldn't find my own post while searching for it on reddit--i searched for "Bush press 9/11 commission" and it didn't pop up...i had to go into my old submissions to track it down--even tho i made the post just 4 months ago!!! </TEXT>

The Washington Times - Saturday, March 22, 2008

The State Department investigation of improper computer access to passport records of three presidential candidates is focusing on one remaining employee  a contract worker with a company headed by an adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama

The probe by States inspector general will include polygraph tests for supervisors in the passport section to find out whether the three contract employees who accessed the records had a political motive or were part of a political operation to obtain personal data on Mr. Obama, Sen. John McCain or Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Two of the three contract employees had been fired before The Washington Times first reported Thursday on security breaches involving Mr. Obamas passport records. The furor expanded yesterday to incidents involving the passport records of Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton.

**The third employee, who has not been fired, worked for The Analysis Corporation (TAC), which is headed by John O. Brennan**, a former CIA agent who is an adviser to Mr. Obamas presidential campaign on intelligence and foreign policy.

The TAC employee is the only individual to have accessed both Mr. Obamas and Mr. McCains passport information without proper authorization, a State Department spokesman said. That employee, who was not named, triggered an electronic alarm system, officials familiar with the probe said.

The accessed records have the data provided in passport applications and used by the department to issue or renew travel documents.

State Department officials said Thursday and yesterday that the intrusions appeared to be the result of imprudent curiosity on the part of contract employees who were hired last summer to help process passport applications.

In Portland, Ore., Mr. Obama said the series of attempts to tap into peoples personal records were a problem not just for me but for how our government functions.

I expect a full and thorough investigation. It should be done in conjunction with those congressional committees that have oversight so its not simply an internal matter, Mr. Obama told reporters.

Mr. McCain, who is traveling in France, called for an apology and a full investigation of the breach. The United States of America values everyones privacy and corrective action should be taken, he said.

Mrs. Clinton had not publicly commented by yesterday evening.

Mr. McCormack said the investigation also will determine whether the records of other high-profile political candidates were accessed improperly and whether there are systemic problems.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice promised that the department will carry out a full investigation and expressed anger about the breaches, as well as the failure to notify senior officials.

It should have been known to senior management. It was not, to my knowledge. And we also want to take every step that we can to make sure that this kind of thing doesnt happen again, she said, adding apologies to all three candidates, starting with Mr. Obama.

I was sorry and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if I learned that somebody had looked into my passport file, Miss Rice said of her telephone apology yesterday to the Illinois senator. She also called Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain.

**Officials do not know whether information was improperly copied, altered or removed from the database during the intrusions**.

We are looking at [whether] there is anything more to why these people did this other than inappropriate curiosity, said Patrick F. Kennedy, undersecretary of state for management, who is in charge of the passport offices.

State Department officials met for about 90 minutes with the Senate staffs of each candidate, along with the staff of Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., Delaware Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has jurisdiction over the Foreign Service.

Rep. Henry A. Waxman, California Democrat, sent a letter to Miss Rice demanding to know the names of the contract employees.

Besides the TAC employee, the State Department said the other two employees worked for Stanley Inc., a 3,500-person technology firm based in Arlington that this week won a $570 million contract to continue providing passport services to the State Department, work the company has done since 1992.

**TAC, a McLean-based information firm that has helped the State Department automate the Terrorist Watchlist over the last several years**, issued a statement last night that it had been notified earlier in the day that one of its contractors had acted improperly. The firm said it had honored a State Department request not to fire its consultant to help the investigation.

**This individuals actions were taken without the knowledge or direction of anyone at TAC and are wholly inconsistent with our professional and ethical standards**, the company wrote.

Calls to the Obama campaign about Mr. Brennan were not returned.

Mr. McCormack said yesterday there was a fourth person who breached the passport records, although he described it as a case of inadvertance. He said a passport office trainee last year was learning how to work with passport electronic records and searched for Mrs. Clintons file as a test, but was immediately admonished, and it didnt happen again.

Working-level supervisors confronted the three employees after a computer alarm system was triggered by the effort to access Mr. Obamas records.

What didnt happen is that that information didnt rise up to senior management levels, so that we could be made aware of it. That should have happened, Mr. McCormack said.

If senior officials were alerted to the intrusions, additional safeguards would have been used to protect the data, Mr. McCormack said.

Officials said the computer alarm that was set off includes a notification mechanism that should have alerted States inspector general. However, it is not clear whether the IG reviewed the improper computer activities, the officials said.

Acting Inspector General William E. Todd and the chief IG branch investigator, James B. Burch, a former U.S. Secret Service agent, are leading the passport probe, which began Thursday. **Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey** said his department was no reason yet to investigate.

Miss Rice and Mr. Kennedy did not learn of the breaches of Mr. Obamas personal data until The Times e-mailed questions about the security breaches on Thursday.

As soon as we realized that there were these unauthorized accesses for Senator Obamas passport files, we collected the information, we briefed the secretary, we briefed Senator Obamas staff, all before we ever replied to the reporter, Mr. McCormack said.

Then we replied to the reporter, and then we all talked to the rest of you as the questions came in, he said.

<TEXT> I agree--I think the electric outage at the White House was a complete false flag designed to SPOOK. Think about the complete rehab the White House got after 9/11--you'd have to be an idiot to think they wouldn't upgrade the electric as they were fortifying it during the construction.

I remember seeing a photo of the WH with the front completely covered with a tarp. I think I remember something about the WH receiving the same type of material which the Pentagon had added (which was hit by a plane or missile on 9/11). I would assume some additional offensive weapon capability was added to the roof of the WH.  In any case, I just can't believe the WH would be connected to the same grid as the general public after 9/11 (obviously commercial and residential buildings are far removed from the WH at this point). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think AJ is a provocateur--in it for the $$$$$$$$$$$.

I think AJ is right about a lot of issues--and is harassed by the gov't on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis.

I think AJ has seen the writing on the wall--and has made changes in the way infowars covers issues. For example, infowars did not post any articles questioning the Tsarnaev conviction during the trial--because he knows the gov't will come down on his ass even harder.  It also seems like Infowars has also added more mainstream links to their mix over the last year (ex: cbs "news"). AJ also knows that google is fucking everyone and making independent articles vanish when people search for "9/11 WTC 7".

I don't think AJ is "controlled opposition" but I do think he is willingly changing the way infowars operates because he sees what the gov't and google are doing. In the end--it's not much of a difference (effectively the gov't has muted infowars).

I would also note that AJ was most likely harassed "Extra Special" on his trip to NYC (which is when he did the Piers Morgan segment I think).  The authorities KNOW they can fuck with him--and it will affect his performance.  It does not excuse AJ making an ass of himself--but it does show a Reason as to Why he may have been wound extra tight the day he went bonkers on cnn. I think AJ even posted a video of him being bullied by NYPD on his way back to his room...

-------------------


**THREAT INFLATION**

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.


The above 6 paragraphs are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

<TEXT> The CIA has been out of fucking control since day 1.

In 1947, these fuckers were [operating on U.S. soil to recruit members of the National Student Association](http://www.c-span.org/video/?324828-1/book-discussion-patriotic-betrayal)--a group funded by the CIA. Must have been hard duping 20 year-olds into signing secrecy agreements (before they knew who they were working for)!!!

When the CIA was created by a handful of [OSS-Wall Streeters and Pentagon Mafia](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30605.htm), the only other people who knew the CIA existed were a few sycophantic senators and President Truman.  It would be 50 years before Americans would find out the CIA received much of their early funding through a secret codicil in the Marshall Plan. That's right: while everyone thought the Marshall Plan funds were going to rebuild cities in Europe/Asia after WWII--the CIA was secretly skimming 5% to buy mansions and fund political parties in Italy, France, Japan (etc). 

FACT IS:  We only know a small percentage of what the CIA did 50 years ago...and we don't have a fucking clue what these fuckers are doing today. 

[WTFU america](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM). Even President Truman thought the CIA was out of control--he wrote an [editorial in the *Washington Post*](http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html) exactly one month after JFK was whacked: 

+ For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.

As the U.S. dollar is being eclipsed by the Chinese yuan--it might be a good idea for the U.S. to quit dictating to the entire planet. 

Someday the U.S. might actually need some goddamn friends and just about every other nation on earth has plenty of reasons to turn their back on us due to the underhanded actions of the CIA and the lies the State Department cranks out on a daily basis. 

The U.S. has attempted overthrow after overthrow after overthrow--sad that so many Americans don't realize what the CIA has done in our name.  At least in Russia most of the readers know they are being lied to--in the U.S.A. the readers mostly still believe the crap fox-cbs-abc-nbc-nyt is feeding us from the bowels of the CIA-Pentagon-State Dept Propaganda Machine.

<TEXT> The Hey Day of Jazz was in the 20's and 30's...WWII broke up many of the bands and helped kill Jazz...BeBop emerged on the backend. Early R   B started in the late 40's and Rock n' Roll came about in the mid 50's...the [Chitlin' Circuit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Chitlin-Circuit-Road-Rock/dp/0393342948) does a great job of describing what life was like for the African-American musicians. The shows traveled around the country--often a wide variety of acts were included. There were no huge modern amps back then, so the shows were quite a bit different. But imagine seeing Ruth Brown with Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis (plus many others)--all on the same bill. 

Chicago RULED in the 20's--Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton were there at the height of Jazz in 1926.  The "Chicago School" of jazz musicians would head to the South Side to catch Armstrong--among them were: Benny Goodman, Bix Biederbecke, Artie Shaw and Gene Krupa. The white musicians morphed Jazz into Swing in the 30's--everything popped one night in LA during a Benny Goodman show and the Swing craze started. 

You should be able to find Ken Burns' *JAZZ* documentary on youtube--the first 3 or 4 episodes do a great job of describing the history of Jazz into Swing into Be Bop...one of the biggest surprises you will find is the racism which was so prevalent...even in the 50's and 60's some of the New Orleans musicians remember playing a gig where they would put a curtain in front of the band *while they were playing*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would disagree--at this point anyone who can read KNOWS the CIA and the NSA are involved in many acts which are morally despicable and constitutionally illegal. Some of these NSA-CIA actions are directed towards Americans on U.S. soil. 

The most recent example being the CIA's creation and funding of the National Student Association--created in 1947 (cough, cough) to act as a honeypot which duped U.S. college students into informing on international students.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI: the is NO relationship between We the People and the CIA.  The CIA was created behind closed doors with no open discussion--a handful of OSS-Wall Streeters and Pentagon Mafia secretly had the Agency created and funded.  

We the People have no fucking goddamn idea what they have done--or what they are doing at this moment. We do know they have LIED and LIED and LIED to us...maybe that's why they won't let We the People see any files--any further exposure would only reveal more LIES.

<TEXT> The US Government is more interested in WAR than in creating PEACE. The USG hides our own history from We the People. The USG allows War Crimes by our own leaders to go unpunished.

-----------------

The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution. If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.

The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with no audit necessary--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties.

The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?  

The USG allows our law enforcement to jail millions. They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it. 

The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about 100 countries right now. Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?

The USG also wages economic warfare against other countries which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. We do not need to overthrow other governments--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.

The USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. Most of our soldiers should be employed building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure--but instead they are sent to fight for oil and the PetroDollar. 

The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...

FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the Joint Intelligence Committee and the 9/11 Commission. Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were obstructed and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world).

I do love the people here--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?

<TEXT> ...and our current president quoted MLK on his way to getting elected, dedicated a statue to MLK once he was elected and, most recently, made a trip to Selma (in part) to celebrate the life of MLK--but forgets to call for the release of the FBI records.

Hollow, disingenuous words followed by disingenuous actions...

NEVER FORGET:  MLK would be abhorred by the 1,000+ drone strikes Obama has allowed and the continuation of the excessive military spending the U.S.A. is pumping into WAR, INC.

NEVER FORGET:  the speech that got MLK killed was his ["Beyond Vietnam"](http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_beyond_vietnam/) speech which he made exactly one year before he was assassinated by elements of our own government.

NEVER FORGET: that the reason we do NOT have a full video of MLK's speech is because the media left after they got some news footage and STOPPED recording--they LEFT the event in the middle of the speech.  Luckily, we do have the audio recording and MLK's full, written speech.

<TEXT> The author does a great job in the book of describing the fanatical taste federal authorities had for prosecuting Al Capone. Eig, thru a stroke of luck, actually got the government to release an unreleased FBI file which showed that Capone was not responsible for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre--it was actually crooked Chicago cops who were killing mobsters to pay them back for a robbery which had taken place a week prior (a cop had been killed in the robbery). Of course, FBI Director/Blackmailer J. Edgar Hoover never saw cops killing gangsters on St. Valentine's Day as a crime.

But, Prohibition had directly led to an upsurge in violent crime among the gangsters protecting their booze and territories. President Hoover appointed a special prosecutor to take Capone down. The prosecutor eventually found evidence from a previous bust of a gin joint--it was an accounting ledger which the government used in their tax evasion case to estimate what Capone's income was. But the accounting ledger also showed the money the cops were being paid off as well. Obviously, the cops were never prosecuted. Same accounting ledger--but all the crooked cops walked as they watched Capone go down. 

Interesting that Eig notes how the prison doctors used "experimental" drugs on Capone while he was being treated in prison for syphilis. Who knows--Capone may not even have had syphilis--they may have just fucked him up while they were using him as a guinea pig.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> very well written article with some great quotes by former LEOs.

i see the cops literally preying upon the African-American population everyday where I live...they literally drive down a main street from a white part of town, pull into the walmart--so they can check all the license plates...then they wait for them to drive out, pull them over and, cha-ching--more money for the corporate prison complex. 

some municipalities actually have parking enforcement drive around and ticket out of state vehicles once they are parked in an area over 30 days for not transferring plates (it might even be shorter than 30 days).

for those who haven't heard: the License Plate Readers the cops use while they are cruising mall parking lots (or pulling you over) will automatically pull up the registered river's info and make different audio sounds for offenses (a cash register opening for a late ticket payment, etc)....dana priest (Wash Post) reported on this in her 2006 book *Top Secret America* (which was mostly focused on the growth of the government/corporate intelligence agencies post 9/11).

CIA Official Dies in Apparent Suicide

Death did not take place at CIA headquarters

BY: [Bill Gertz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gertz)	  

April 4, 2014 11:46 pm

A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.

CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.

We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done, White told the Washington Free Beacon. He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.

A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.

Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agencys elite spying branch.

The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.

The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.

No other details of the death could be learned.

The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.

Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agencys computers that were being used in the investigation.

The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.

The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.

The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agencys role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.

Morrell testified that subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.

The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.

Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agencys role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.

<TEXT> The article in the *Washington Free Beacon* was the only source of info (all other articles merely repeated the vague details from the Free Beacon).

Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the freebeacon.com article: **11:46 PM on a Friday night**. It was just ONE DAY AFTER the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report Edit which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There had been hearings on Benghazi that week as well...Seymour Hersh had released his article The Red Line and the Rat Line in the London Review of Books (which has been thoroughly whitewashed in the complicit U.S. media)...

In 2011 Barack Obama led an allied military intervention in Libya without consulting the US Congress. Last August, after the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, he was ready to launch an allied air strike, this time to punish the Syrian government for allegedly crossing the **red line** he had set in 2012 on the use of chemical weapons.

... The **rat line**, authorised in early 2012, was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the opposition. Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida.

http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line

So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past YEAR???

<TEXT> ---------------

Frustrating listening to this interview--wish Jon Gold had scored a few more points early on--especially with the reasoning behind Iraq. The Iraq War wasn't just about oil--what a lot of people miss is that it was about the PetroDollar. In fall 2000, [Saddam had switched from the PetroDollar to the Euro](http://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system-part-3/) in Iraq's oil-for-food program. The expansion of the Military Industrial Complex greatly enriched thousands of private defense/intelligence corporations. Glad that Jon Gold did mention Dick Cheney and Halliburton and was able to remain quite calm. It's very well documented that the neocons were frothing at the mouth for [regime change in Iraq throughout the 90's](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003). 

I also wish Jon Gold had pointed out how the 9/11 Commission seemed to be set up to fail. Financially, the commission was initially set up with $3 million--which may sound like a lot, but the largest investigation of the largest crime on American mainland soil had to pay 84 people (a large percentage of attorneys). In contrast, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence funded the EDIT the CIA Torture Report with $40 million (right off the bat in 2008). I found Shenon's *The Commission* did a pretty good job of revealing how aspects of the commission were controlled--mostly by Zelikow, but the commission offices were actually in a CIA managed building (and in the wake of what we know of the [CIA spying recently on the SSCI](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/12/calls-brennans-ouster-emerge-along-details-cia-search-senate-computers/)...). It is useful to study the Pattern these commissions/investigations take--reading Gaeton Fonzi's *The Last Investigation* is helpful in this regard (even though it is about the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations).  

Overall, I'm glad I listened and definitely have a lot of respect for Jon Gold who did a great job of separating the 9/11 provocateurs (Alex Jones, Webster Tarpley) from those who are seeking Justice and Accountability. 

I think Jonathon Kay is a sycophant--especially since Jon Gold pointed out that Kay has some slight connection to James Woolsey (a former CIA director). The entire main stream media is corrupted filth--I expect no actual truth from them. They will [LIE us into another useless war soon enough](https://vimeo.com/33033186). Fox, cbs, nbc, abc the nyt--they are all CIA-Pentagon Sycophants (bootlickers, ass-kissers, fawning parasites) who are happy to head home to their McMansions which are paid for In Full with the blood of at least 1.5 million people from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan...and a few thousand dead U.S. soldiers, too.

<TEXT> Actually...after WWII, the Marshall Plan was hijacked by the CIA--there was a secret codicil which sent at least 5% of the roughly $15 Billion (about $700 million) to the CIA...these funds were used by the agency to fund political parties in Europe and Japan (as well as to buy large houses for the station chiefs)...the agency also began funding the National Student Association in 1947 (which held conferences around the globe to spy/recruit/tattle on the international students)...

The CIA's take wasn't revealed until about 50 years later (it's always  a great way to control history if you can keep the truth from coming out for at least 50 to 100 years).

CBS, of course, has many CIA ties and would certainly be more than willing to pump out some propaganda. (see Carl Bernstein's "CIA and the Media" article) </TEXT>

<TEXT> i've never come across the site before--which doesn't mean anything--but many of us "conspiracists" think the government puts out disinfo to make the truthers look wacky. 

i didn't have time to watch the whole interview--that's just my gut reaction. did the architect provide any documents or a photo of him with one of the bin Ladens? the bin Ladens are a huge family and do have a construction company in Saudi Arabia--so there is a chance they may have crossed paths. 

i would also hope the architect would have contacted the authorities at the time if this had actually happened...

glad you like some of my posts--i definitely try to bring some interesting points up... </TEXT>

<TITLE> The US Government is more interested in WAR than in creating PEACE. The USG hides our own history from We the People. The USG allows War Crimes by our own leaders to go unpunished. </TITLE>

<TEXT> The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution. If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.

The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with no audit necessary--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties.

The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?  

The USG allows our law enforcement to jail millions. They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it. 

The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about 100 countries right now. Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?

The USG also wages economic warfare against other countries which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. We do not need to overthrow other governments--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.

The USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. Most of our soldiers should be employed building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure--but instead they are sent to fight for oil and the PetroDollar. 

The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...

FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the Joint Intelligence Committee and the 9/11 Commission. Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were obstructed and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world).

I do love the people here--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?

<TEXT> In terms of money, I find it even more revealing that the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with just $3 million--while the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence budgeted $40 million for the Torture Report to be spliced, diced and redacted. The attorneys who did the "editing" were CIA-approved. 

I definitely recommend people read up on other commissions--*The Last Investigation* by Gaeton Fonzi does a great job of showing how the HSCA was controlled by the purse strings and manipulated by the CIA (false leads, excessive control of files, etc). The patterns used to undercut the commissions become more apparent when you read Philip Shenon's *The Commission* directly after. (I do recognize there are weak aspects of Shenon's work which David Ray Griffin (?) has pointed out.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Until I watched a C-Span panel discussion earlier today, I never realized that LBJ admitted this not once--but twice.  [L. Fletcher Prouty mentioned this *Atlantic* article](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4532917/l-fletcher-prouty-describes-jfk-assassination-conspiracy). LBJ does seem to be drunk or heavily medicated in the [CBS interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfFMUWg39WU), but a second admission to a reporter at his ranch is significant--especially since LBJ was very guarded after he left DC. 

I finally watched *Rich Man's Trick* for the first time a few weeks ago--which confirmed one of my biggest suspicions (that the JFK limo almost came to a stop). The Secret Service agent who ran up to the JFK limo was always a red flag for me.

The *Atlantic* article also mentions that reporters would question LBJ about where he was on the night of the 23rd--any ideas about the significance of this? It also reminds me of how Dick Cheney was absent in the weeks following 9/11 (except for arranged press interviews).  </TEXT>

The recruits made reports on foreign students inside of the U.S. but also helped recommend U.S. citizens (college students) to recruit. 

Later it became clear that the NSA was funded by the CIA.

<TEXT> Everyone must be a detective...Each source must be measured and weighed accordingly...the corporate main stream media is, far too often, complicit in covering up facts and even goes as far as omitting the entire story...case in point: the build up to the Iraq War (see Bill Moyer's [BUYING THE WAR](https://vimeo.com/33033186))...the New York Times, still to this day, covers up any possibility that there was a conspiracy in the JFK whackjob. these cover-ups or omissions are referred to as Deep Politics by researcher/author Peter Dale Scott.  

History matters because we must know what happened in order to judge if our government is acting responsibly. As it stands We, the People cannot do this because the USG allows the CIA-FBI-NSA to hide such a large portion of our own history from us. Why is the USG hiding the security footage from the 89 cameras which the FBI confiscated from around the Pentagon on 9/11???  Why does the USG not allow us to view records from WWII??? There are even records from the 1920 bombing of Wall Street which a Yale history professor, Beverly Gage, was not allowed to view for her book *The Day Wall Street Exploded* (2008).  In fact, the USG would not release even 1 new file even though the files were 85 years old.  How do we know if the FBI or CIA or NSA are acting within the law???  How do we know if the CIA or NSA or the Pentagon haven't taken control of the USG???  

Answer: We can't know how to judge their actions if We, the People are not given access to their files. Of course, the agencies may omit information, but most likely there will be clues left for researchers to decipher. 

I have started a subreddit, [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/), which is focused on pdf files of "conspiracy" books and author interviews as a reference tool.  Hope you get a chance to read up and learn!!! </TEXT>

Series of articles on Gary Webb by [consortium news](https://consortiumnews.com/tag/gary-webb/)

Also read an excellent update by the Intercept:  

[MANAGING A NIGHTMARE: HOW THE CIA WATCHED OVER THE DESTRUCTION OF GARY WEBB](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/25/managing-nightmare-cia-media-destruction-gary-webb/)
On September 18, the agency released a trove of documents spanning three decades of secret government operations. Culled from the agencys in-house journal, Studies in Intelligence, the materials include a previously unreleased six-page article titled Managing a Nightmare: CIA Public Affairs and the Drug Conspiracy Story. Looking back on the weeks immediately following the publication of Dark Alliance, the document offers a unique window into the CIAs internal reaction to what it called a genuine public relations crisis while revealing just how little the agency ultimately had to do to swiftly extinguish the public outcry. Thanks in part to what author Nicholas Dujmovic, a CIA Directorate of Intelligence staffer at the time of publication, describes as a ground base of already productive relations with journalists, the CIAs Public Affairs officers watched with relief as the largest newspapers in the country rescued the agency from disaster, and, in the process, destroyed the reputation of an aggressive, award-winning reporter.

<TEXT> Hastings did actually write about being threatened in his last (and final) book, *The Operators*: 

------
(page 64)

Jake came up to me. "We'll hunt you down and kill you if we don't like what you write," he said. "C. will hunt you down and kill you."

[note: Jake McFerren is General McChrystal's top civilian political advisor responsible for helping foster international relations with the 44 coalition countries involved in Afghanistan. Jake was also McChrystal's West Point roommate and drinking buddy....C. was a member of the SAS, the most elite British commando unit]

-----

(page 88)

"Sorry about threatening to kill you," Jake said. It was the first time anyone in the group had acknowledged the blowout on Friday night. 

"Yeah, geez, the guy is just trying to do his job," McChrystal said. 

"No worries. Like I said, it happens all the time, but yeah, you're probably the highest rank to do so," I said.

I laughed, and they didn't.

As a side note:  Jeremy Scahill was also threatened (most likely by JSOC)--you can see him answer his cellphone and receive the threat in his documentary *Dirty Wars* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting to search for "September 2002 iraq sued" turns up very few actual articles...the Propaganda gained from the U.S. by this move was quite tangible: Front Page headlines battering the unsuspecting minds of Americans unwilling (or unable) to see through the lies. 

i also think the lawsuit helped Kenneth Feinberg pressure the 9/11 Victims' Family Compensation Fund participants into working with him--note the 1,400 participants would be over half of the 2,700 or so killed in the WTC attacks...

In order to be included in the Victims Families Fund, participation was placed under a 2 year timeline imposed by Feinberg. Was the 2 year time period imposed by Feinberg also a factor in mandating the 9/11 Commission Report be finished in such a short 16 month time frame? obviously there was an election--but i think the 2 year time frame was a more important consideration for the Bush-Cheney administration.

wonder if there are any Feinberg-Cheney ties (Cheney does go all the way back to the Nixon era)...wonder if Cheney ever came across Feinberg during the Agent Orange lawsuits (Cheney was Sec. of Defense under GHW Bush when some of the Agent Orange settlements may have been active...not sure, but I think Feinberg may have worked on the Agent Orange settlements.)

I also wonder how the [9/11 Victims' Compensation Fund](http://cryptome.org/doj122101.txt) was written, voted on and passed by Congress in just 10 fucking days--on Sept. 21...obviously the u.s. was stricken with fear and congress would have put their stamp on just about anything at the time--the important thing for the Compensation Fund was to put victims/families into the lawsuit and thereby placing them under some secrecy rules which the victims and families most likely had to agree to. Overall, Cheney saw the 9/11 Victims' Families Compensation Fund as a way to SILENCE those closest to the scene of the crime...these 9/11 victims and families were those with the most interest in asking questions and demanding answers--a very important group to silence (or at least have under official observation and controllable). </TEXT>

YES, Iraq...

..it got headlines--but went fucking nowhere...these lawsuits are often just PROPAGANDA for the U.S. to grab headlines and smear the opponent in slime to the unsuspecting (duped) public.

September 4, 2002: Iraq Sued for Conspiring with Al-Qaeda in 9/11 Attacks  

Over 1,400 relatives of 9/11 attack victims sue Iraq for more than $1 trillion, claiming there is evidence Iraq conspired with al-Qaeda on the 9/11 attacks. [CBS NEWS, 9/5/2002] 

One of the key pieces of evidence cited is an article in a small town Iraqi newspaper written by Naeem Abd Muhalhal on July 21, 2001. He describes bin Laden thinking seriously, with the seriousness of the Bedouin of the desert, about the way he will try to bomb the Pentagon after he destroys the White House. He adds that bin Laden is insisting very convincingly that he will strike America on the arm that is already hurting, which has been interpreted as a possible reference to the 1993 bombing of the WTC. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein apparently praised this writer on September 1, 2001. The lawsuit is based largely on the idea that Iraqi officials were aware of plans to attack American landmarks, yet did not warn their archenemy, the US. [ASSOCIATED PRESS, 9/4/2002] 

Former CIA agent and terrorism consultant Robert Baer is hired by the prosecuting legal team to find evidence of a meeting between Mohamed Atta and Iraqi agents on April 8, 2001, but despite the help of the CIA, he is unable find any evidence of such a meeting. [CBS NEWS, 9/5/2002]

<TEXT> excellent point...In December 2000, Saddam switched his banking to the Euro in the UN Oil-for-Food program.

----------------------

According to page 28 of Clarks book:

On September 24, 2000, Saddam Hussein allegedly emerged from a meeting of his government and proclaimed that Iraq would soon transition its oil export transactions to the euro currency.

Not long after this meeting, Saddam Hussein began preparing to make the switch from pricing his countrys oil exports in greenbacks to euros. As renegade and newsworthy as this action was on the part of Iraq, it was sparsely reported in the corporate-controlled media.

Clark comments on the limited media coverage on page 31 of his book:

CNN ran a very short article on its website on October 30, 2000, but after this one-day news cycle, the issue of Iraqs switch to a petroeuro essentially disappeared from all five of the corporate-owned media outlets.
By 2002, Saddam had fully converted to a petroeuro  in essence, dumping the dollar.

On March 19, 2003, George W. Bush announced the commencement of a full scale invasion of Iraq.

According to Clark and Engdahl, Saddams bold threat to the petrodollar system had invited the full force and fury of the U.S. military onto his front lawn.

No proof of that...but [Bush and Cheney did, on multiple occasions, ask Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)...neither Bush nor Cheney would  testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission...

Please watch this [ENTIRE 5 MINUTE PRESS CONFERENCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) Bush held afterwards...NOT even 10 questions!!! 

IRONIC--the man who couldn't quit saying "9/11" couldn't face the 9/11 Commission in public and under oath!!! Watch the body language and listen closely!!! Notice Bush doesn't say HE TESTIFIED--rather he says "had a good conversation".

<TEXT> google "syria oil pipeline" and do your own research, but it's the timing and the analysis that counts: (from article)

The last Iraq war wasnt about weapons of mass destruction. It was about oil. **We borrowed the money from the Chinese** so that we could make it safe for the Chinese and Exxon to frack Iraq. Bombing Syria is not about a chemical weapons of mass destruction. Its about the rivalry between competing gas pipeline projects  one that has been proposed to take gas from Quatar to Europe  via Syria and Turkey. The other proposed from Iran, via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon: The Battle of Pipelineistan - fought by US troops  on behalf of Quatar, Israel, Turkey, Europeans  everybody but Americans  to resolve who gets the gas line concession through Syria. Its about that simple.

-----------

I also found this article about Syria discovering oil in 2011 very interesting as well...

The F-35 is years away from being ready for initial operational capability. To send this airplane on a combat deployment, or to declare it ready to be sent, as early as the Marines 2015 or the Air Forces 2016 IOC dates, is a politically driven and irresponsible mistake. DOT Es report shows that the current IOC plans for the F-35A and B should be rejected as unrealistic.

<TEXT> I interpreted the comments as leaning towards a SET UP in which shots were fired by authorities (or some provocateurs) in an attempt to frame the protestors in a bad light and cause public opinion to blame the movement. not sure if you are familiar with [COINTELPRO](http://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/Black%20Liberation%20Disk/Black%20Power!/SugahData/Government/COINTELPRO.S.pdf), but there was some crazy F'ed up things in the 50's, 60's and 70's which J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) was in charge of. 

as for the possible charges:  I would definitely think firing a rubber bullet at a person would be attempted murder--it could hit someone in the eye. 

more charges would be added on if the attempt was on an officer. 

even more charges if it was in front of a large crowd. 

even more more charges if it was a situation involving race. </TEXT>

A 15-month investigation by the Guardian and BBC Arabic reveals how retired US colonel James Steele, a veteran of American proxy wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua, played a key role in training and overseeing US-funded special police commandos who ran a network of torture centres in Iraq. Another special forces veteran, Colonel James Coffman, worked with Steele and reported directly to General David Petraeus, who had been sent into Iraq to organise the Iraqi security services

At the last, Dwight Eisenhower exploded in anger and frustration.  "The structure of our intelligence organization is faulty," he told Allen Dulles. It makes no sense, it has to be reorganized, and we should have done it long ago. Nothing had changed since Pearl Harbor. "I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this," said the president of the United States. He said he would "leave a legacy of ashes" to his successor.

The **corporate media** is [100% COMPLICIT](https://vimeo.com/33033186)...it's even worse in Iraq where the US-UK is responsible for over 3 million deaths thru their military actions and economic sanctions since 1990....

I can't believe anyone even bothers watching/reading cbs, abc, nbc, cnn or the *NYT* anymore.  

hmmm...I wonder if the [corporate media are connected to the defense companies](http://www.theglobalmovement.info/wp/areas-of-focus/global-financial-war/who-controls-the-media)...or if u.s. politicians invest in defense corporations...i doubt it--no way they would do that...well, [maybe](http://www.cartoonistgroup.com/subject/The-Dick+Cheney-Comics-and-Cartoons-by-Ann+Telnaes'+Editorial+Cartoons.php).

from Prologue:

No longer a traditional espionage service devoted to stealing the secrets of foreign governments, the Central Intelligence Agency has become a killing machine, an organization consumed with man hunting.

And just as the CIA has come to take on tasks traditionally associated with the military, with spies turned into soldiers, so has the opposite occurred. The American military has been dispersed into the dark spaces of American foreign policy, with commando teams running spying missions that Washington would never have dreamed of approving in the years before 9/11. Prior to the attacks of September 11, the Pentagon did very little human spying, and the CIA was not officially permitted to kill. In the years since, each has done a great deal of both, and a military-intelligence complex has emerged to carry out the new American way of war. </TEXT>

Q: Should there be another 9/11 Commission?

A: There should be about [FIFTEEN](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/911-commissions-forum-shows-dc-works-4.html) 9/11 Commissions!!!

--Max Cleland (former 9/11 Commission member)

--------------------

9/11 Commission: Our Investigation Was [Obstructed](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/)

And now we have the 9/11 Commission Chairmen stating as explicitly as can be that the mere concealment (let alone destruction) of these videos constituted the knowing and deliberate obstruction of their investigation into the worst attack on U.S. soil in our history. Combined with the fact that the videos destruction almost certainly constitutes obstruction of justice with regard to numerous judicial proceedings as well, **were talking here about extremely serious felonies at the highest levels of our government**.

<TEXT> No repercussions!!!

the IG wrote a report (without the 90 videotapes the CIA destroyed), then the Senate Select Cmte on Intelligence decided to spend 4 years and $40 million to re-write the Torture Report (so the SERFS of America could read the report). By contrast the 9/11 Commission was only initially awarded $3 million and given 16 months to complete their official report.

<TEXT> hundreds (if not thousands) of vehicles, equipment sold for the price of scrap...so are the generals telling the Pakistani supply line to TURN AROUND--we decided to stay...I guess we should build some more trucks now, too.

The U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan poses an enormous logistical challenge. The landlocked country is halfway around the world, has few rail lines and poor roads, and is ringed by mountainous terrain. By the end of next year, U.S. officials say, they need to pull out 24,000 vehicles and 20,000 shipping containers, one way or another.

The Pentagon has budgeted $5 billion to $7 billion to ship all that gear home. But the final tab will hinge greatly on the extent to which the military can rely on the ground routes through Pakistan.

...

Ammunition, weaponry and other sensitive materials must be transported by air for security reasons. About 28 percent of cargo is being flown all the way back to the United States, and 50 percent is flown to seaports in the Middle East, then loaded onto ships for the remainder of the journey.


The more we put on the [Pakistan route], hopefully the more money all of us will have in our pockets, the defense official said. Its cheaper and just as effective if its working.

**What about the unredacted files of the the U.S. activists who were spied on during the civil rights movement?**

NSA-FBI Spied on U.S. Senators, MLK, activists in 1960's (entire article based on release of just 1 page of NSA internal history document): http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/25/secret-cold-war-documents-reveal-nsa-spied-on-senators/

The names of the NSAs targets are eye-popping. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King and Whitney Young were on the watch list, as were the boxer Muhammad Ali, New York Times journalist Tom Wicker, and veteran Washington Post humor columnist Art Buchwald. But perhaps the most startling fact in the declassified document is that the NSA was tasked with monitoring the overseas telephone calls and cable traffic of two prominent members of Congress, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) and Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.).

I think 9/11 as a community needs to arrange a corporate media BOYCOTT. I know this has been tried [before](http://911truthnews.com/mainstream-media-boycott-for-911-justice/)--but right now seems a great time:

Boycotts may not need to affect sales at all in order to be effective, he writes. Rather, boycotters influence stems from their ability to make negative claims about the corporation that generate negative public perceptions of the corporation. Hence, corporations that are already struggling to maintain their previously positive reputations will be more likely to concede to boycotts and quell any further damage the boycott may do to their reputation.

-----

Press conference of GW Bush after meeting with the 9/11 Commission. Bush was accompanied by Dick Cheney for some unclear reason--they were NOT under oath, no official record was kept...afterwards [Bush held a 5 minute press conference which most likely didn't even have 6 questions...](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2okmfy/gw_bushs_full_press_conference_after_speaking/)

According to a CIA internal memo dated November 29, 1975,[2] Zapata Petroleum began in 1953 through Bush's joint efforts with Thomas J. Devine, a CIA staffer who had resigned his agency position that same year to go into private business, but who continued to work for the CIA under commercial cover. Devine would later accompany Bush to Vietnam in late 1967 as a "cleared and witting commercial asset" of the agency, acted as his informal foreign affairs advisor, and had a close relationship with him through 1975.[3]

The CIA Old Boys were reeling. In the 1970s, exposure of their dirty games and dirty tricks made the Cold Warriors look sinister -- and silly. Then, President Carter ordered a housecleaning that left scores of CIA men out in the cold. 

In 1980, the CIA men wanted back in and their champion was former CIA director George Bush. With Bush and Ronald Reagan in power, the old spies could resume their work with a vengeance. The temptation was to do to Jimmy Carter what the CIA had done to countless other world leaders -- overthrow him, a frightening chapter

<TEXT> I doubt if the frontline doc included Thomas Drake's (et al.) letter--it was released January 2014 or so...

So, in addition to NSA Insiders' claiming the NSA obstructed the 9/11 Commission--we also have the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commision who claimed their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA...Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in 2008: http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/

In fact, when former 9/11 Commission member Max Cleland was asked if there should be another 9/11 Commission, he said: "There should be fifteen 9/11 Commissions!!!"

<TEXT> there's nothing wrong with working at an apple store...but Thomas Drake was a legitimate whistleblower who was forced to incur huge legal bills while being stripped of his lifetime profession as an intelligence analyst...Thomas Drake is most likely making a fraction of the income/benefits that he was making inside the pentagon.

<TEXT> Thomas Drake was still FUCKED by the system--he is now working at an apple store (after a lifetime in u.s. intelligence)...so don't sugarcoat that shit they threw at him...

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

------------------

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

<TITLE> THINK about It: The CIA Was Most Likely Involved in the Planning of the World Trade Center Complex--Going All the Way Back to before 1960... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-01 04:23:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For me, one of the most intriguing items I've come across is the fact that the CIA was most likely involved in the planning of the World Trade Center--going all the way back to before 1960. This fact changes the manner in which the WTC complex should be looked at: as a CIA built asset which the Agency surely used in many ways unknown to the citizens and occupants of the WTC complex. It has shifted my thinking a bit towards Larry Silverstein being more of a victim than a planner. More importantly, by seeing the WTC as a CIA asset and creation--the questions about access to the WTC to pre-install explosives fades away. It inherently implies the WTC was a financial center for the CIA since the early 70's when the towers opened up, and that the destruction of the WTC complex may have been an intentional good-bye to financial records of the CIA from the 1970's on. We also know Enron had CIA connections and benefitted from the destruction of the WTC complex (which included the SEC office). Was Enron just the tip of the iceberg?

There is no doubt about the Rockefeller-CIA connections--but it is hard to come across articles which research this issue. I went thru the indexes of books by Peter Dale Scott, Michael Ruppert, Kevin Ryan, Russ Baker, Tim Weiner, Joseph Trento--not much there! Russ Baker did have an eye-catching paragraph which shows the power the Rockefellers had over the president of the united states:

----

(page 310, Family of Secrets)

Less well known is that David and Nelson Rockefeller used the takeover as a pretext to prevent the Iranian revolutionaries from withdrawing petrodollars from the Chase Manhattan Bank in London, where the shah kept most of his assets. According to several thoughtful accounts, the shah's looted billions were crucial to Chase's then shaky finances. Their withdrawal could have precipitated an international financial crisis. The hostage crisis then provided a justification for the Carter administration, under pressure from Rockefeller interests, to seize all of Iran's assets.

-----

The only other bits and pieces I've found were from:

1) ["On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison:](http://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2suotr/was_the_nyc_world_trade_center_created_by_the_cia/) One paragraph from this book started me thinking about this possibility...

2) [Maurice Phillip's research](http://somesecretsforyou.blogspot.com/2010/10/permindex-cia-link.html)

3) and a book (which I haven't yet read) ["Rockefellerocracy"](https://books.google.com/books?id=2Uv5mgQMdFYC pg=PA101 lpg=PA101 dq=david+rockefeller+cia+world+trade+center source=bl ots=ejqCQPAdLC sig=qc7PDUhdEDfPg-KwqIw5GnWHvac hl=en sa=X ei=J2jxVIzINNSvyAStl4KQDA ved=0CC4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage q=david%20rockefeller%20cia%20world%20trade%20center f=false)

Our tax dollars are being used to ruin Iraq, Afghanistan--where the US has also installed Puppet Regimes that can only be held in place with US military presence...

Michael Hastings quoted a 2008 RAND study which was interesting: they studied over 600 terrorist organizations since 1968--only 7% of the organizations came to an end via military action...43% of the groups came to a political settlement...40% were ended via local law enforcement-intelligence actions...another item Hastings brought up was what Gen. McChrystal called "Afghan Math"...if there are ten insurgents and you kill two--you may end up with twenty insurgents...so, 10-2 does not equal 8...10-2 equals twenty...yet, the u.s. persists in dronings and air strikes...

McChrystal called "Afghan Math"...if there are ten insurgents and you kill two--you may end up with twenty insurgents...so, 10-2 does not equal 8...10-2 equals twenty...yet, the u.s. persists in dronings and air strikes...

We should expect as American citizens that this would cost at least $100 billion for 2-years." </TITLE>

<TEXT> I grew up reading the Chicago Tribune...in 2nd or 3rd grade my school began a reading program where we read the paper twice a week...I have studied the de-evolution of the Tribune, how it has become a vacuous chatterbox for corporate interests and become nothing but an unofficial Propaganda Wurlitzer for the Pentagon. 

Sports is an entertainment that has become elevated to distract citizens from what is really important--the Tribune has regularly taken the top portion of their front page (which used to be devoted to "hard news") and used it to promote these vacuous "news" stories (mostly sports, sports, tv, movies and...sports)....

The Tribune has become just an unofficial u.s. state department-pentagon Chatterbox which simply regurgitates the latest press release and fails to investigate to uncover Real facts...

other subjects briefly mentioned were:

3/4" audio tape from 1972 or so...Enron, Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld being prosecuted by the ICC, Porter Goss and "Roman", an SR-91 overhead three times a day...the inability of the washington post to be able to mention Project Grover even though there is supposedly free speech in the u.s.

there was plenty more....including a long code, about 20 (numbers and capital letters) which was listed...BillCaseyHoneyPot was being a bit taunting--unclear if it was a joke or whatnot...strange that the comments have been scrubbed from wa po and now cryptome is down and the link 404'd...

After completing the new manual, Patreus gets picked to return to Iraq to put his revamped theory to the test. He asks for twenty thousand more troops and gets them, increasing the overall number of forces  in Iraq to a hundred and fifty thousand, or a 15 percent increase. What follows is eighteen months of brutal fighting, at the cost of over one thousand American lives and over ten thousand Iraqis killed. Behind the scenes, McChrystal, operating his own Phoenix-like Special Ops program, wipes out "thousands," according to McChrystal's deputy, Major General Bill Mayville, noting that "jSOC was a killing machine." Violence does, however, eventually decline, and Patreus--and counterinsurgency--is able to take credit for creating the conditions for a face-saving withdrawal. COIN, it appears, is fully vindicated. The surge becomes a modern military myth, one eagerly embraced in Washington by those in the media and political world who'd been complicit in starting the Iraq War.

A closer inspection of the surge myth reveals a murkier set of factors. One of the major turning points in the war is in Anbar province, when local tribal leaders decide to turn against Al Qaeda. This starts happening a year before Patreus returns to command and has little to do with American military strategy. Analysis crediting the turnaround in Anbar usually ignores the reason why Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was able to establish a foothold there in the first place: American bungling for the first three years of the war. The tribal leaders welcomed Al-Qaeda to fight the American occupiers, but then realized they'd made a significant tactical error. Al Qaeda in Iraq eclipsed the American occupation in brutality and stupidity--as one tribal leader would say, he would have "worked with the devil" to beat Al Qaeda. The tribal leaders realized that they weren't just fighting the Americans--the new Shiite-led government in Baghdad was also keen to wipe them out. Faced with the brutality of AQI, coupled with a sectarian cleansing campaign originating from the highest levels of the new government in Baghdad, the tribal leaders, mainly Sunnis, make a desperate play: They tell the Americans that for the right price, they'd partner with them. American soldiers start to hand out bags of cash to insurgents--about $360 million spent in just one year. Overnight, former enemies who had killed Americans for three years became "freedom fighters." ("They are true Iraqi patriots," as one American general will describe his former enemies.) We find a way to buy off the enemies we'd created by invading--the strategy is akin to digging a hole in the desert, then filling the hole with cash and dead bodies and calling it a victory. </TEXT>

Jake came up to me. "We'll hunt you down and kill you if we don't like what you write," he said. "C. will hunt you down and kill you."

[note: Jake McFerren is General McChrystal's top civilian political advisor responsible for helping foster international relations with the 44 coalition countries involved in Afghanistan. Jake was also McChrystal's West Point roommate and drinking buddy....C. was a member of the SAS, the most elite British commando unit]

(page 88)

"Sorry about threatening to kill you," Jake said. It was the first time anyone in the group had acknowledged the blowout on Friday night. 

"Yeah, geez, the guy is just trying to do his job," McChrystal said. 

"No worries. Like I said, it happens all the time, but yeah, you're probably the highest rank to do so," I said.

I laughed, and they didn't.

(page 73-74)

Over the past year, journalists had regularly been given intimate access to McChrystal and his staff.  A reporter for the New York Times spent a few days in Kabul with him, producing a profile that found McChrystal's only fault was that he worked so hard, "he sometimes affords little tolerance for those who do not."  He described his running habits: "eight miles a clip, usually with an audiobook at his ears."  A writer for the Atlantic had enjoyed a good stay, writing an article titled "Man Versus Afghanistan."  He asked if McChrystal was Afghanistan's only hope. He found reason to believe: "eight miles a day, eating only one meal a day, and sleeping four hours a night--itself expresses an unyielding, almost cultic, determination."  Time magazine had put him as runner-up for Person of the Year, opening with an anecdote about a competitive "eight to ten mile" run he had with General Patreus. 60 Minutes spent the most personal time with him: He allowed them to film while he was jogging around the base. They'd all told the same story:McChrystal as a modern combination of saint and ninja, a "Jedi Knight," as Newsweek called him. 

-------

(page 75)

As a country, we'd changed since Vietnam--the ghost McChrystal and his generation of military leaders desperately wanted to exorcize. The fear that their wars, too, could end in disgrace: "It's not going to look like a win, smell like a win, or taste like a win," Major General Bill Mayville, McChrystal's director of operations, would tell me. "This is going to end in an argument." An argument they were determined to win. One of the first books McChrystal read after arriving in Kabul was Stanley Karnow's "Vietnam: A History."  McChrystal called the author to ask if there were any lessons that would apply to Afghanistan.  "The main thing I learned is that we never should have been there in the first place," Karnow reportedly told him. It wasn't what the general wanted to hear.

-----

(page 76)

The lesson our leaders took from Vietnam was not, it turns out, how to avoid another Vietnam.  It was how to seal off the horror: to ensure that only a small group felt and saw it. An all volunteer military, and a further reliance on the most elite, specialized soldiers to do the nation's work we prefer to ignore.  Entering houses at midnight and shooting unarmed men while they sleep. A widespread acceptance of drone strikes, killings committed by remote control--McChrystal watched a man on a videofeed in his headquarters for 17 days before he ordered the strike on a compound to kill Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He went to see the dead man's body: the pictures of the corpse were displayed at a press conference, a modern day version of putting a man's head on a spike.

------

(page 110)

I had downtime to digest the reporting. A question persisted: What was the motivation behind McChrystal's decision to have me tag along? Was it that Rolling Stone would reach a demographic of young officers and recruits they wanted to impress? Would it confirm the view that the team held of McChrystal--that he was a "rock star," as they regularly called him? Dave explained that Special Forces operators had a healthy disrespect for authority; Rolling Stone fit this self-styled image perfectly. They were building Brand McChrystal--ballsy, envelope-pushing, risk taking. New York Times Magazine cover? Done. Time cover? Done. Atlantic cover? Too easy. 60 Minutes profile? No worries. Rolling Stone? Boom. It was a natural evolution of a very aggressive media strategy to establish McChrystal as a contender for the greatest general of his generation, on a par with Patreus.

(pages 142-143)

Insurgents are Afghans. What is essential for success is not to kill the insurgents, because they are the Afghan people. If you kill the insurgency, you kill the Afghan people you came to protect, and there's nobody left to win over. 

If you kill two out of ten insurgents, you don't end up with eight insurgents. You might end up multiplying the number of fighters aligned against you. McChrystal calls it "Insurgent Math." If you kill two, he said, "more likely you're going to have something like twenty. Those two that were killed, their relatives don't understand that they're doing bad things. Okay, they think. a foreigner just killed my brother--I got to fight them."

Afghan Math: 10  - 2= 8 (wrong)...10 - 2= 20 (right)

-------

(page 205)

The manual performs a rather impressive sleight of hand: tying counterinsurgency to the War on Terror. The vast majority of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan is not against any combatant who poses a threat to the United States homeland. But to justify the tremendous outlay of resources and lives it requires to enact a counterinsurgency plan, the theories claim that COIN, somehow, is an effective way to deal with transnational terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda. That this is patently false does not give the movement much pause. A RAND study "How Terrorists Groups End," commissioned in 2008, explicitly points out that the best way to defeat terrorist networks is not through military force, but through law enforcement. The authors looked at 648 terrorist groups that were active from 1968 to 2006. In 40 percent of the cases, policing is "the most effective strategy," with local intelligence and police agencies able to penetrate and disrupt the terror groups, while 43 percent reached a political accommodation with the government. The study states: "Military force led to the end of terrorist groups in 7 percent of the cases," and that military force has not "significantly undermined (Al-Qaeda's) abilities."

<TITLE> Was the NYC World Trade Center created by the CIA back in the 1960's??? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-18 19:50:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Was the NYC World Trade Center created by the CIA back in the 1960's???

I recently purchased a copy of "On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison (1988 edition, paperback).  I knew the Oliver Stone movie was based on this book--so I was glad to part with the 25 cents the book was priced at.  I'm pretty familiar with the JFK whack job, so there wasn't anything too surprising until I got to page 100--the last paragraph reads: 

According to these articles, the CIA--which apparently had been conducting its own foreign policy for some time--had begun a project in Italy as far back as the early 1960's. The organization, named the Centro Mondiale Commerciale (the World Trade Center), had initially been formed in Montreal, then moved to Rome in 1961. Among the members of its board of directors, we learned, was one Clay Shaw from New Orleans.

So, the CIA seemed to be actively creating "World Trade Centers" around the globe so the CIA could conduct under the radar financial transactions. This money was going to back political parties in Italy--what other types of tranactions were being conducted? Very likely the CIA wanted these "World Trade Centers" for their ever-expanding series of front companies which often dealt with black market money from drug sales and arms dealing. Those of us who have read Peter Dale Scott (or some Michael Ruppert) are quite familiar with the accusations that the OSS/CIA have long-standing drug and mafia links going back to WWII. Possibly, the CIA very early on began to realize the illegal monies gained in the black markets were the easiest way to fund all of their other subversive activities--with the added bonus of NOT having any oversight by those pesky politicians (who don't need to know CIA business anyways). 

Interesting to note that the NYC WTC used eminent domain to take over the grounds on which the WTC would be built on--this could be assured with CIA backing. We know Rockerfeller had deep CIA connections. Agency man Phillip Agee claimed his first task in the CIA was to do background checks on employees of Rockerfeller's Standard Oil. Rockerfeller also had much to do with the planning of the WTC in NYC. Was the NYC WTC, from the beginning, designed as a CIA front? 

The biggest reason Jim Garrison lost the Clay Shaw trial was because he counldn't definitively link Clay Shaw and the CIA. We now know that Clay Shaw was, in fact, heavily involved with the CIA. After Clay Shaw's death in 1974, Richard Helms was called before the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations and testified that Clay Shaw was involved with the CIA. "On the Trail of the Assassins" also goes on to show the CIA creating Centro Mondiale Commerciales around the globe in the early 60's--I can just imagine Allen Dulles traveling and contacting his endless supply of men like George De Mohrenschildt and Clay Shaw...the book also notes how Clay Shaw's operation was shut down in Italy for "espionage activities" in 1962. So, the CIA knew these fronts were risky and must be considered expendable at a moments notice. 

also see: http://scottlazarowitz.org/blog/2010/09/the-twin-towers-and-their-evil-eminent-domain-roots/

You may also be able to view pages 100-104 of Jim Garrison's book on google--it does give some more background...I would type the pages in but i am on my ipad travelling...

<TEXT> Opening Statement: The Vice President and I just finished a...a, um--a good conversation with the 9-1-1 Commission. It was wide-ranging. It was, uh, important. Uh, it was, uh, it was just a good discussion and I really, I appreciate the members, um...I want to thank the chairman and the vice-chairman for bringing the commission here...and, uh, giving us a chance to share views on different subjects...and they had a lot of good questions...and, uh, Im glad I did it, Im glad I took the time. Its an important commission, and its important that, uh, they ask the questions they ask so they can help make recommendations necessary to better protect our homeland. It was a--I enjoyed it. Let me ask--answer--a few questions...

-----------------

Interesting that GW Bush couldnt even complete his FIRST sentence: after he says the vice president and I just finished a... Bush pauses before he can find the right word. Bush can only use a very broad word to describe 
the conversation because Bush and Cheney were not placed under oath during the conversation. 

Interesting that Bush comes out by HIMSELF, without Cheney--is this designed to fool everyone? 

The other interesting bit of Bushs opening statement is that he shakes his head side-to-side (which means NO) before he says the words better protect our homeland.

GW Bush then goes on to answer 3 questions and rudely tell a 4th reporter that he already answered his question yesterday.

If the 9/11 Commission was so important--why did it take Bush so long to, Not Testify--but have a conversation" with them? Why is the press conference last only 5 minutes afterwards? Why are only 4 questions asked?

There are more interesting moments during the 4 Question Press Conference--what can you find?

----------

While I was trying to find the full press conference, I checked C-Span. First I searched for video Bush 9/11 Commission...here is what pops up: http://www.c-span.org/search/?searchtype=Videos query=bush+9%2F11+commission+

I then made my search more specific and searched for video Bush 4/29/2004--still NO GW Bush press conference!!!

WHY are they REMOVING this EVIDENCE from the record? (its available on youtube thanks to researchers like Jon Gold)...You can literally find thousands of GW Bush videos--but anything to do with 9/11 Commission seems to be missing INTENTIONALLY from the record...Isnt that what CRIMINALS do--remove or destroy evidence???
Anyone who has looked into this can see a much longer pattern of the Vice President and the President attempting to obstruct or disrupt the investigations looking into 9/11...

In addition to UNDERFUNDING the 9/11 Commission, the Bush-Cheney war criminals also acted quickly to Cover Up the evidence and impede any meaningful investigation...

+ The government shipped much of the WTC steel (aka the evidence) to China and India to be recycled ASAP (isnt that what criminals do--destroy evidence?)...

+ Within 10 days, the government was looking to pay off the victims relatives and forcing them to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive money from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...the families were also given a strict deadline in which to make their decision.

+ Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occasions. (Sen. Daschle was on the Joint Intelligence Inquiry into 9/11).

+ GW Bush wouldnt testify to the 9/11 Commission UNDER OATH and BEFORE THE PUBLIC (hes just the President--what did you expect?)...

+ The 9/11 Commission Co-Chairmen wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* claiming the investigation was obstructed by the CIA and the White House.

<TEXT> I guess there used to be 8 Congressional Committees who handled different aspects of the oversight--it was cut back to just 2 Committees around 1980 I think--supposedly due to committee members leaking info. As for Congress doing its job--I came across this shocking quote:

-----------

Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.

<TEXT> I wouldnt doubt it if my posts in r/worldnews (and other major subs) are eyeballed and brigaded (most likely by humans!). Techniques seem to be: downvotes, comments using negative language which have nothing to do with my comment, stacking comments above mine which results in my comment being pushed down, the entire article/post being erased by mod or user...

Of course this isnt happening every time I post a comment or link--but one day I think these techniques were used on me in 3 consecutive comments I made. A large part of it is the subjective enforcement of the rules which the mods in the larger subreddits censor the articles with.

<TEXT> Buckley was on the debate team at Yale, so YES he's formidable. I definitely found some of his statements to be wild--youre 100% right about the I dont care who killed Kennedy statement. 

It appears to me that Buckley used his into of Mark Lane to paint him with the Left Liberal corner. Buckley then asks his first question: 

-------------

WB: Id like to begin by asking Mr. Lane this: it is widely alleged that sinister forces who have a vested interest in suppressing the real truth as to the identity of the assassin have been here and they are killing off crucial people--former strippers at Rubys joint in Dallas, a truck driver, roommates of Oswalds--that kind of thing. How come if you were the man who has changed history, these forces havent bumped you off?

---------------

*have been here* 

HERE seems very out of place.

Buckley is obviously working with notes--this seems an outlandish question to open the interview with. I think Buckley was trying to knock Mark Lane off balance from the start. Didnt work!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive watched this 4 or 5 times now--each time through I notice more. Youre definitely spot on about Buckleys darting eyes--it looks like he intends physical harm to Mark Lane at some points (on the split screen). 

Not familiar with the NLP reference--but surely it makes an impression when Buckley mentions the Soviets, then physically acts out pressing a button--then goes on to mention Oswald and he (Buckley) holds out his hands as if he was shooting a rifle. 

There are also points where Buckleys EARS move--I think this may be from tightening the jaw...is this a sign of anger?

Never knew about Mark Lane getting caught up in the Jonestown mess.

Havent watched the Baldwin-Buckley debate yet. It is worth mentioning that the U.S. painted communism/socialism as an Evil Menace in a much more pronounced and effective manner than in England. Many of the labor strikes of the early 20th century blamed the violence on socialists. There was also the [Wall Street bombing of 1920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing) which was blamed on socialists--with very little hard evidence. In fact, in 2009 a Yale American History professor, Beverly Gage, wrote a book about the incident--and was unable to get any additional files released for her book--almost 90 years later.

<TEXT> Never heard about these pre-9/11 raids either...

-----------------------

September 5-8, 2001: Raid on Arab Web Hosting Company Precedes 9/11 Attacks  

The US Joint Terrorism Task Force conducts a three-day raid of the offices of InfoCom Corporation, a Texas-based company that hosts about 500 mostly Arab websites, including Al Jazeera, the Arab worlds most popular news channel. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; WEB HOST INDUSTRY REVIEW, 9/10/2001] Three days after the initial raid, the task force is still busy inside the building, reportedly copying every hard disc they could find. It is not clear how long these websites remain shut down. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001] InfoCom began to be seriously investigated by the FBI in late 1998 when the name of an employee was discovered in the address book of bin Ladens former personal secretary. There also was evidence of a financial link between InfoCom and a top Hamas leader (see October 1994-2001). InfoCom is closely connected to the Holy Land Foundation. Not only are the two organizations across the road from each other in Richardson, Texas, a number of employees work at both organizations. For instance, Ghassan Elashi is both the vice president of InfoCom and chairman of Holy Land. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; NEW YORK TIMES, 12/20/2002] A local bank closes Holy Lands checking accounts totaling about $13 million around the same time as the raid on InfoCom, but Holy Lands assets are not officially frozen by the government. [DALLAS BUSINESS JOURNAL, 9/7/2001] The US will shut down Holy Land and freeze their assets two months later (see December 4, 2001) for suspected ties to Hamas. Holy Land is represented by Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer   Feld, a Washington, D.C., law firm with unusually close ties to the Bush White House. [WASHINGTON POST, 12/17/2001] </TEXT>

<TEXT> Imagine being shackled, your head is covered with thick black plastic so you cant see, you are then transported like cattle to another country, placed in a small room (or even a box) in which strange, intense loud music was played, the temperature may be drastically changed--if youre lucky they take you out for an hour per day, but maybe they leave you in there for 48 hours...After a certain period you begin to lose track of time as your senses shut down and your brain malfunctions into a state of shock. Maybe they feed you with enormously oversalted food and give you 1/2 glass of water. This is all legal because they havent caused your body physical harm!!!

Obviously, Im not saying that every prisoner at Guantanamo was treated this severely--but all of them were transported in shackles, with blacked out goggles on and most likely endured sleep deprivation, loud noises and other degradations...Prolonged exposure to these methods often cause severe mental trauma (sometimes in 48 hours).

The book [*A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805082484/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_3?pf_rd_p=1944687542 pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1 pf_rd_t=201 pf_rd_i=0299234142 pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_r=1EVRY4N9N3Z7RFCJR2YD) (by Alfred W. McCoy, 2006) goes much further into the issue, beginning with research the CIA funded in the 50s--much of it conducted in U.S. universities and hospitals. The doctors even published their research in medical journals afterwords.
At one point in the 1960s, the CIA made their rookies be subjected to these methods and a large portion of them couldnt finish the treatment (I think it was a week long).

What most people dont understand is that the U.S. military trained Iraqi police/militia forces in torture methods after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. [The guardian made a documentary](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/06/pentagon-iraqi-torture-centres-link) last year centered around a U.S. officer named James Steele and his direct ties to Donald Rumsfeld. One has to question if teaching torture methods to Iraqis helped fuel the extremely horrifying headlines we saw from Iraq about large numbers of bodies being found beheaded. Most likely this was a back-and-forth, but I think that training, funding and feeding this type of torture program likely has much to do with the growth of ISIS and their brutal methods. The U.S. didn't just commit torture--the U.S. outsourced torture which may have helped feed the extremely vicious cycle of bloodbath after bloodbath. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im just starting to read one of Alfred McCoys books which begins with a brief history of the CIA research programs of the 1950s--scary fucking shit these CIA-funded doctors did with their research. Worst of all is the way the CIA attorneys squirm out of human rights agreements and then go on to bend and twist the meanings of words so the methods used arent considered torture. 

Imagine being shackled, your head is covered with thick black plastic so you cant see, you are then transported like cattle to another country, placed in a black cell (or even a box) in which strange, intense loud music was played--if youre lucky they take you out for an hour per day, but maybe they leave you in there for 48 hours...After a certain period you begin to lose track of time as your senses shut down and your brain malfunctions into a state of shock. Maybe they feed you with enormously oversalted food and give you 1/2 glass of water. This is all legal because they havent caused your body physical harm!!!

Obviously, Im not saying that every prisoner at Guantanamo was treated this severely--but all of them were transported in shackles, with blacked out goggles on and most likely endured sleep deprivation, loud noises (etc.)...Prolonged exposure to these methods often cause severe mental anguish (sometimes in 48 hours). At one point the CIA made their rookies be subjected to these methods and a large portion of them couldnt finish the treatment (I think it was a week long). 

What most people dont understand is that the U.S. military trained Iraqi police/militia forces in torture methods after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. The guardian made a documentary last year centered around a U.S. officer named James Steele and his direct ties to Donald Rumsfeld. One has to question if teaching torture methods to Iraqis helped fuel the extremely horrifying headlines we saw from Iraq about large numbers of bodies being found beheaded. Most likely this was a back-and-forth, but I think that training, funding and feeding this type of torture program likely has much to do with the growth of ISIS and their brutal methods.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, its scary what the U.S. has done to Mexico, Central and South America while fighting the fake War on Drugs. I have also come to realize that the U.S. media has negatively effected my perception of people from the Middle East. As a child the media coverage of the Iran Hostage crisis greatly impacted my views about Iranians. Its only been more recently that I have been able to understand that the hostage crisis was actually blowback from the CIA 1953 coup detat in Iran. Not sure when the CIA files actually began to come out--but Im pretty sure that was never mentioned on *Nightline* (which began airing to give late night coverage of the hostage crisis). 

I guess the movie about Gary Webb is experiencing turbulence--I saw an online petition to pressure the studio (either they have shelved it or are cutting out parts). Even though its just a movie, I hope it gets released...I read in James Risens book *State of War* that NSA director Hayden actually watched *Enemy of the State* (with Will Smith)...(for some reason cryptome took the first page of chapter 2 out) http://cryptome.org/nsa-program.htm </TEXT>

the editor of consortium news worked for the AP and helped expose Iran-Contra...

As one of the reporters who helped expose the Iran-Contra scandal for the Associated Press in the mid-1980s, I was distressed by the silliness and propaganda that had come to pervade American journalism. I feared, too, that the decline of the U.S. press corps foreshadowed disasters that would come when journalists failed to alert the public about impending dangers.

Also by 1995, documents were emerging that put the history of the 1980s in a new  and more troubling  light. Yet, there were fewer and fewer media outlets interested in that history.

E. Snowden: I take the threat of terrorism seriously, and I think we all do. And I think its really disingenuous for the government to invoke and sort of scandalize our memories, to sort of exploit the national trauma that we all suffered together and worked so hard to come through to justify programs that have never been shown to keep us safe, but cost us liberties and freedoms that we dont need to give up and our Constitution says we should not give up.

B. Williams: But you can see how it happened. Guys with box cutters spent $200 using our own aviation system to take down our own buildings and smash into the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. What are we going to do? Its a non-traditional enemy  the expression is, an enemy we cant see. What are we going to do?

E. Snowden: You know, and this is a key question that the 9/11 Commission considered. And what they found, in the post-mortem, when they looked at all of the classified intelligence from all of the different intelligence agencies, they found that we had all of the information we needed as an intelligence community, as a classified sector, as the national defense of the United States to detect this plot. We actually had records of the phone calls from the United States and out. The CIA knew who these guys were. The problem was not that we werent collecting information, it wasnt that we didnt have enough dots, it wasnt that we didnt have a haystack, it was that we did not understand the haystack that we have.

The problem with mass surveillance is that were piling more hay on a haystack we already dont understand, and this is the haystack of the human lives of every American citizen in our country. If these programs arent keeping us safe, and theyre making us miss connections  vital connections  on information we already have, if were taking resources away from traditional methods of investigation, from law enforcement operations that we know work, if were missing things like the Boston Marathon bombings where all of these mass surveillance systems, every domestic dragnet in the world didnt reveal guys that the Russian intelligence service told us about by name, is that really the best way to protect our country? Or are we  are we trying to throw money at a magic solution thats actually not just costing us our safety, but our rights and our way of life?

--------------------

Former NSA Officers Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) Accuse U.S. Government of 9/11 Cover Up

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.

Still uncertain who to believe about cellphones being able to make calls from 20,000-30,000 feet in 2001...Seems most likely the cellphones would be cut off in a short time frame or experience quite a bit of interference...What about the AirPhones on the planes? have you looked into it? 

also, I recently saw this 9/11 Commission memo which states that WH Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten said that Dick Cheney ordered Flight 93 shot down. After Cheney confirmed the shoot down, he then called President Bush to let him know it was shot down on his (Cheneys) orders. (slide down to Page 4)

<TEXT> I find no logic in comparing the wars the U.S. began after 9/11 with WWII (which was put in motion by Hitlers invasion of Poland). I find it equally offensive to simply accept the justification that there are fewer casualties in todays wars."

After 9/11 the U.S. literally raced off to war without even conducting proper, thorough investigations of what ACTUALLY took place. Evil Dick Cheney even asked Senator Tom Daschle, who was on the Intelligence Committee, [NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occassions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0).

Afghanistan offered to turn UBL over to U.S. authorities if the U.S. provided proof he had ordered the strikes--but the U.S. didnt even respond. Instead, the CIA began operations in Afghanistan by going  around Tora Bora throwing millions of dollars in cash to local tribes...Of course, the CIA came up empty handed.

We all know the intelligence was cooked on Iraq to give Bush/Cheney their useless, illegal war.

<TEXT> I was impressed with Shenons *The Commission*--but definitely do understand David Ray Griffins frustration with Shenon. I think part of what Shenon has attempted to capture in *The Commission* and *A Cruel and Shocking Act* was the inner workings of the way the 9/11 Commission and the Warren Commission functioned; meaning that Shenon was not trying to reveal the truth of what happened on 11-22-63 or 9/11. Shenon was more interested in the structure of the commissions, how the information flowed and the personalities which ended up controlling the output. 

Personally, I find this approach to be obtuse--how could Shenon not find a way to follow up with some investigation at the NSA?

Everybody wins, especially the CIA. 

The only loser was the State Dept.--but blaming the victim is usually the easiest route.

The fact that it takes 5 years and $40 million to edit" the Torture Report should also tell you a lot about how CROOKED the US government is--and how incredibly NAIVE Americans are. In comparison, the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with $3 million and given just 16 months to complete their fictitious report. </TEXT>

U.S. policy in Iraq, from 1990-2003, was about REGIME CHANGE.

Chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear weapons were all just used to strike FEAR into the U.S. taxpayers. The U.S. knew exactly what Saddam had because the CIA and Mi6 were pumping information from intelligence/satellite sources to the UN Weapons Inspectors.

<TEXT> A Little History...

--------------

In 1949, the CIA installed a pro-American colonel, Adib Shishakli, as the Syrian leader. He won direct American military assistance along with covert financial aid. The CIA station chief in Damascus, Miles Copeland, called the colonel "a likeable rogue" who "had not, to my certain knowledge, ever bowed down to a graven image. He had, however, committed sacrilege, blasphemy, murder, adultery and theft." He lasted four years before he was overthrown by Ba'ath Party and communist politicians and military officers. 

In March 1955, Allen Dulles predicted that the country was "ripe for a military coup d'etat" supported by the agency. In April 1956, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt and his British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) counterpart Sir George Young tried to mobilize right-wing Syrian army officers; the CIA delivered half a million Syrian pounds to the leaders of the plot. But the Suez fiasco poisoned the political climate in the Middle East, pushed Syria closer to the Soviets, and forced the Americans and the British to postpone their plan at the end of October 1956.

In the spring and summer of April 1957,they revived it. A document discovered in 2003 among the private papers of Duncan Sandys, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's defense secretary, spells out their effort in detail.

Syria had to be "made to appear as the sponsor of plots, sabotage and violence directed against neighbouring governments," it said. CIA and SIS would manufacture "national conspiracies and various strong-arm activities" in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and blame them on Syria. They would create paramilitary factions and spark revolts among the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus. The creation of the appearance of instability would destabilize the government; border clashes manufactured by American and British intelligence would serve as a pretext for the pro- Western armies of Iraq and Jordan to invade. The CIA and SIS envisioned that any new regime they installed would likely "rely first upon repressive measures and arbitrary exercise of power" to survive.

Roosevelt identified Abdul Hamid Serraj, the longtime chief of the Syrian intelligence service, as the most powerful man in Damascus. Serraj was to be assassinated,along with the chief of the Syrian general staff and the head of the Communist Party.

The CIA sent Rocky Stone, who had cut his teeth in the Iran operation, to serve as the new chief of station in Damascus. Accredited as a diplomat, a second secretary at the American embassy, he used promises of millions of dollars and unlimited political power to befriend officers in the Syrian army. He represented his recruits in reports to headquarters as a crack corps for an American-backed coup.

Abdul Hamid Serraj saw through Stone in a matter of weeks.
The Syrians set up a sting. "The officers with whom Stone was deal- ing took his money and then went on television and announced that they had received this money from the 'corrupt and sinister Americans' in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria," said Curtis F. Jones, a State Department officer sent to clean up the mess Stone left behind. Serraj's forces surrounded the American embassy in Damascus, seized Stone, and interrogated him roughly. He told them everything he knew. The Syrians identified him publicly as an American spy posing as a diplomat, a veteran of the CIA's coup in Iran, and a conspirator with Syrian army officers and politicians to overthrow the government in exchange for millions of dollars in American aid.

The revelation of this "particularly clumsy CIA plot," in the words of the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Charles Yost, had consequences that reverberate today. The Syrian government formally declared Rocky Stone persona non grata. That was the first time that an American diplomat of any stripebe he a spy working undercover or a bona fide State Department officerhad been expelled from an Arab nation. In turn, the United States expelled the Syrian ambassador to Washington, the first expulsion of any foreign diplomat from Washington since World War I. The United States denounced Syria's "fabrications" and "slanders." Stone's Syrian co-conspirators, including the former president, Adib Shishakli, were sentenced to death. A purge of every military officer who had ever been associated with the American embassy followed.

It is time for members of Congress who truly care about rule of law, oversight and the financial security of this country to speak up. Why? Because, first and foremost, the AUMF continues to contravene congressional oversight. For example, when the Obama administration sent 100 "military advisors" to Uganda in the name of counterterrorism in 2011, Congress received a simple note from President Obama. No oversight.

More recently, after unilaterally negotiating a "status of forces" agreement with Niger, the administration sent a note to Congress saying that it was sending 100 troops to the country. This week, we sent troops to Mali. Again, no oversight.

This is the new normal. Statistics provided by Special Operations Command (pdf) indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013. The AUMF premise, no matter how it gets tweaked, is enabling a system of eternal warfare, a reality that is not only financially untenable for a nation in deep debt, but also ethically indefensible.

GLENN HASTEDT, AUG 23 2013

A starting point to deciphering how effectively Congress has handled its intelligence oversight responsibility here is to look to existing studies of congressional oversight.  They depict a weak oversight system marked by two characteristics.  First, it is overwhelmingly reactive, rather than anticipatory: it acts as a fireman responding to a problem rather than as police officers on patrol looking for problems.  Congressional oversight is thus sporadic.  It occurs when a fire breaks out and ceases when the fire is extinguished, to return again should smoldering embers produce another fire.

This pattern is very much in evidence in intelligence community oversight.  Four major intelligence fires have been put out.   In the mid-1970s the fire was widespread illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activity within the United States including wiretapping and mail openings.  In the mid-1980s controversy centered on the Reagan administrations covert action program in Latin America.  The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States brought forward the third congressional wave of intelligence community oversight.

Most recently we have witnessed a rapid series of fire alarms set off by disputes over the conduct of the Global War on Terrorism.  Collectively they can be seen as constituting a fourth major fire.  The first involved a secret warrantless surveillance program authorized by President George W. Bush in October 2001 giving the NSA  the authority to intercept communications between individuals on American soil and individuals abroad without judicial approval, in essence circumventing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court.  The second centered on the nature of the techniques used to interrogate suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Naval Base.  The third involved the increased use of drone aircraft to kill suspected terrorists, especially Americans.  The NSA revelations are the most current fire alarm to be set off.

--------------------

Amy B. Zegart 	The Roots of Weak Congressional Intelligence Oversight 

Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.

These qualitative impressions are supported by two quantitative metrics most frequently used to evaluate oversight: hearing and legislative productivity. Tracking hearings held by fifteen House and Senate committees in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, I found that the intelligence committees ranked at the bottom every year except one. In 2005, the House Intelligence Committee held just 23 hearings (both classified and unclassified), compared to 77 hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee,
91 in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and 104 hearings held by the Foreign Affairs Committee. Intelligence committees also trailed behind others in producing legislation. In a comparison of legislative productivity among four major Senate policy committees, intelligence again ranked last. Between 1985 and 2005, the Senate Intelligence Committee considered an average of just six bills per year. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered an average of 118 bills per year, the Senate Banking Committee considered 161 bills, and the Senate Commerce Committee considered an average of 241 bills each year.

Zo Carpenter on January 30, 2014 

First, a brief history. After revelations about abuses by the CIA and other agencies in the 1970s, Congress struck what Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at American University, calls a grand bargain, to accommodate the paradoxical need to submit secret programs to democratic oversight. New legal constraints on intelligence activities would be enforced not in public but instead behind the veil by the intelligence committees and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (also known as the FISA court). As Colorado Senator Mark Udall said at the Intelligence Committee hearing, This committee was created to address a severe breach of trust that developed when it was revealed that the CIA was conducting unlawful domestic searches.

The Snowden leaks indicate the bargain has broken down. In essence, the delicate balance Congress sought to strike thirty-five years ago now appears to be tipped, rather decisively, in favor of the intelligence community, Vladeck explained in an e-mail.

Intelligence officials have done some of that tipping themselves, by withholding information from the public and lawmakers. On Wednesday, Wyden said the committee had been stonewalled by intelligence officials; indeed, none of his questions received direct answers, although Wyden did receive promises from officials to get back to him by specific deadlines. Wyden also cited several incidents in which officials had given inaccurate testimony in public hearings. Last March, for example, James Clapper told Wyden that the NSA did not wittingly collect data on American citizens, a claim we now know from the Snowden leaks to be false.

Denis McDonough Supported Intelligence Oversight When Bush Was President
Posted: 10/28/2014 by Ali Watkins and Ryan Grim

In 2006, with the Bush administration resisting efforts by Congress to look into the execution of its global war on terror, the Center for American Progress published a thorough document outlining the role of transparency in democracy.

Previous Senate and House Members of the intelligence committees were notably different from their successors today," the report lamented. "They were more interested in performing their oversight function responsibly than in protecting the executive branch when a committee member was of the same party."

The paper's lead author: Denis McDonough.

Today, it's McDonough, the White House chief of staff, who is protecting the executive branch from Senate Democrats fighting to perform their oversight function.

But in 2006, Center for American Progress fellow McDonough was deeply unsatisfied with the state of intelligence oversight in the U.S. Congress. Its completely lacking and soft, he wrote in his report on the subject, and the committees are far too deferential to the executive branch.

FYI: If anyone at the Justice Department actually gave a fuck about the U.S. Constitution + the Bill of Rights--then the Upper Brass at the NSA from the past 13 years would have been read their rights before an actual investigation began. (And, YES, the NSAs corporate criminal partners such as Booz Allen should be included as well.)

I have no doubt that if the Justice Department ever got around to defending the laws of the U.S. that the Pentagon would just start another useless Trillion Dollar War--which looks to be coming up soon anyways.

There is also a history of Saudi money being used by the CIA (which GHW Bush was director of in 1976)...

From [Consortium News](http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/121900b.html):

Weinberger was one of the first officials outside the White House to learn that Reagan had put the arm on **Saudi Arabia** to give the contras $1 million a month in 1984, as Congress was cutting off the CIA's covert assistance through what was known as the Boland Amendment.

Handling the contra-funding arrangements was Saudi ambassador **Prince Bandar**...
In 1985, the Saudis doubled their annual contra gift from $12 million to $25 million...

<TEXT> Some great tidbits in the History Commons Timeline that allow you to connect the dots--Cheney saved the Reagan-Bush presidency by defusing the Iran-Contra investigation...Cheney was then rewarded with the Sec. of Defense post under GHW Bush...I also didnt realize that David Addington was asst general counsel for the CIA during Iran-Contra (addington would become Cheneys attorney in the OVP under GW in 2001).

from http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/110500b.html

-----------------

But the Reagan-Bush administration was not ready to tell all. Immediately, the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill moved to counter and to contain the scandal. For his part, Bush insisted that he was not in the loop on the Iran-contra business.

Cheney to the Rescue

One of the key congressional Republicans fighting this rear-guard action was Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who became the ranking House Republican on the Iran-contra investigation. Cheney already enjoyed a favorable reputation in Washington as a steady conservative hand.

Cheney smartly exploited his relationship with Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was chairman of the Iran-contra panel. Hamilton cared deeply about his reputation for bipartisanship and the Republicans quickly exploited this fact.

A senior committee source said one of Cheneys top priorities was to block Democrats from deposing Vice President Bush about his Iran-contra knowledge. Cheney kept trying to intimidate Hamilton, the source said. He kept saying if we go down that road, we wont have bipartisanship.

So, Hamilton gave Bush a pass. The limited investigation also gave little attention to other sensitive areas, such as contra-drug trafficking and the public diplomacy operation. They were pared down or tossed out altogether.

Despite surrendering to Cheneys demands time and again, Hamilton failed, in the end, to get a single House Republican to sign the final report.

Only three moderate Republicans on the Senate side  Warren Rudman, William Cohen and Paul Trible  agreed to sign the report, after extracting more concessions. Cheney and the other Republicans submitted a minority report that denied that any significant wrongdoing had occurred.

The watered-down Iran-contra majority report essentially let Vice President Bush off the hook. Bushs political career was saved.

With the Iran-contra scandal contained, Bush mounted a 1988 presidential campaign that set the modern standard for negativity, race-baiting and a win-at-all-cost ethic. In 1989, Cheney became Bushs defense secretary.

<TEXT> Perhaps the Saudis were helping the CIA create an enemy. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US defense industry needed to replace Enemy #1, the Communists...

"Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, **until some other adversary could be invented**. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

<TEXT> The U.S. has spent about [$10 TRILLION in total National Security Budget since 9/11](http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/defense-budget/2014/americas-one-trillion-national-security-budget.html) including about $5 TRILLION on the useless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

The lies of the Bush-Cheney War Criminals have all been shredded--there were no WMDs in Iraq, there were no Iraqi-Al Qaeda connections. The Bush-Cheney administration claimed Usama bin Laden (et al.) planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11--yet the administration balked when Afghanistan offered to capture and turn over UBL if the U.S. could show proof that UBL committed the 9/11 attacks. 

Instead, Bush-Cheney never provided any evidence--they sent in the CIA into Afghanistan with plenty of CASH on hand to pay off Afghan warlords to help hunt UBL in Tora Bora. Apparently throwing millions of dollars around in foreign countries doesnt always guarantee success--so the U.S. military went to war in Afghanistan. 

Back in the U.S., the Bush-Cheney War Criminals began covering up 9/11 by asking the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 NOT to investigate--in fact [Dick Cheney asked Tom Daschle NOT to investigate several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0). The CIA, the FBI, the NSA all stonewalled the 9/11 Commission at every turn as well. In the end, the 9/11 Commission co-chairmen wrote a letter in the *NYT* accusing the [White House and the CIA of OBSTRUCTING the 9/11 investigation](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/).

General Wesley Clark is also on the record stating the [Bush-Cheney War Criminals intended to go to War with 7 countries in 5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw). 

I dont know what exactly happened on 9/11--but I do know the U.S. government is LYING and the 9/11 Commission Report was a WHITEWASH. If you havent looked into any of these issues I would urge you do some research--because the USA seems to have become fixated on war. 

The list of countries the US has bombed and/or attempted to overthrow the government of since the end of WWII is most likely much longer than you think. Lately, I definitely worry that eventually the world is going to get sick of the US bullying its way around the globe with boots on the ground in over 100 countries. Statistics provided by [Special Operations Command indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/05/authorization-use-military-force-blank-check) </TEXT>

http://www.scribd.com/doc/13279605/9-11-Commission-Memo-Executive-Branch-Minders-Intimidation-of-Witnesses

-------------

FYI: I originally saw these posted on cryptome.org titled DoD Declassifies 9/11 Interview Documents (which is the same archive but sorted by New)

I posted [Notes from an interview with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten](http://www.scribd.com/doc/231427854/DH-B2-Josh-Bolten)--on page 4 it states that Dick Cheney gave the order to shoot down Flight 93, then verified it was shot down and called POTUS to let him know it was shot down.

In the comments for the Josh Bolten post, someone questioned where exactly all of these documents were coming from...the best answer was from u/pubestash:

I'm surprised this hasn't gotten more attention. Maybe its just assumed to be true here already but this is some strong evidence from official documents stating that 93 was shot down by Cheney.

These do look legit btw, here on [archives.gov](http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11/faqs.html) is the FAQ for the 9/11 commission documents and they say how NARA will be making these available online. The scribd profile is of those people scanning the documents.

I would argue that all FBI-CIA-NSA files should be released unredacted no later than 8 years after creation. This would act as a deterrent to government officials abusing their power--and allow We, the People to know our true history.

**Saddam Turns His Back on Greenbacks
By William Dowell for TIME. Monday, Nov. 13, 2000**.

Europes dream of promoting the euro as a competitor to the U.S. dollar may get a boost from SADDAM HUSSEIN. Iraq says that from now on, it wants payments for its oil in euros, despite the fact that the battered European currency unit, which used to be worth quite a bit more than $1, has dropped to about 82[cents]. Iraq says it will no longer accept dollars for oil because it does not want to deal in the currency of the enemy.

The switch to euros would cost the U.N. a small fortune in accounting-paperwork changes. It would also reduce the interest earnings and reparations payments that Iraq is making for damage it caused during the Gulf War, a shortfall the Iraqis would have to make up.

The move hurts Iraq, the U.N. and the countries receiving reparations. So why is Saddam doing it? Diplomatic sources say switching to the euro will favor European suppliers over U.S. ones in competing for Iraqi contracts, and the p.r. boost that Baghdad would probably get in Europe would be another plus.

<TEXT> Has anything been done about the NSA spying on U.S. citizens? Have the upper brass at the NSA been read their rights? In the 70s, according to [James Bamford](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/02/the-nsa-and-me/), the attorney general actually took this step. Interestingly enough, Bamford was also working with a secret 6,000 page document.

But my biggest battle with the NSA came before my book was even published. Without the agencys knowledge, I had obtained the criminal file that the Justice Department had opened on the NSA. Marked as Top Secret, the file was so sensitive that only two original copies existed. Never before or since has an entire agency been the subject of a criminal investigation. **Senior officials at the NSA were even read their Miranda rights**.

Obamas first words were basically Look forward, not back. So, NO...nothing will be done.

Once you consider the fact that the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with $3 million and 18 months to produce their report; and that the SSCI funded the Torture Report Summary with $40 million and allowed the CIA-approved attorneys 4 years to slice, dice and blackout the findings--now you might be able to understand what a WHITEWASH the 9/11 Commission was.

<TITLE> The real problem was that there was no accountability. And without real accountability everything turns to shit. --James Angleton (excerpt from Jospeh Trentos The Secret History of the CIA) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-05 02:17:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> James Angleton, written off as a crank and a madman by his critics, had the hardest job in the CIA: keeping the enemy out. What he learned before his death was that we are our own worst enemy. 

When I ventured to his pleasant house in Arlington in late 1985, I found him coming to grips with this thought. I realize how I have wasted my existence, my professional life, he told me. He was not bitter--just uncomfortable with the thought. His entire being told him that his beloved intelligence community had been penetrated by the Soviets with agents of great skill. He understood why his colleagues in the CIA eventually grew tired of his mole hunts and his efforts to protect the place. I was always the skunk at the garden party, and even your friends tire of that, he said.

The last time I saw James Angleton, his face, always thinner than thin, had changed little, even though the cigarettes he would not give up had destroyed his lungs with cancer. The other cancer that was eating away at him was the suspicion and fear that came with his job. He was a man estranged by his career from his wife and children and dying in total emotional isolation.

Within the confines of his remarkable life were most of Americas secrets. You know how I got to be in charge of counterintelligence? I agreed not to polygraph or require detailed background checks on Allen Dulles and 60 of his closest friends. His monologue would stop only for a sip of tea or a violent fit of coughing. They were afraid that their own business dealings with Hitlers pals would come out. They were too arrogant to believe that the Russians would discover it at all. The real problem, Angleton concluded, was that there was no accountability. And without real accountability everything turned to shit.

All the trappings of Angletons legend were gone by this time, except for his love of exotic tea. But now, this man who had struck fear into most of his colleagues--the man who had been able to end a CIA career with a nod or a phone call--unassuming house seemed empty. You know, the CIA got tens of thousands of brave people killed...We played with lives as if we owned them. We gave false hope. We--I--so misjudged what happened.

I asked the old man dying how it all went so wrong. With no emotion in his voice, but with his hand trembling, Angleton replied: Fundamentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you would be promoted. These people attracted and promoted each other. Outside of their duplicity, the only thing they had in common was a desire for absolute power. I did things that, in looking back on my life, I regret. But I was part of it and loved being in it...Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, Carmel Offie and Frank Wisner were the grand masters. If you were in a room with them you were in a room full of people that you had to believe would deservedly end up in hell. Angleton slowly sipped his tea and then said, I guess I will see them there soon.

Angleton has been portrayed as a lunatic and even a torturer, and, as this book has documented, he did harm to many colleagues. However, I hope this book also clarifies who he really was and gives the reader a sense of the man whose lifes mission was to protect the CIA from the enemy. As he told me, Sometimes you can find the real enemy right in the mirror.

At the end, he seemed grateful for the release his lung cancer brought him. I am afraid whatever sins I have committed in my life, he said as he sipped his tea, have now come home to roost...I am fundamentally a failure. I failed to protect the CIA, because there was no real desire to secure the place from the Soviets. I never understood the great advantage the Russians had over us...As Americans we just hold no real value in secrecy. God, it was such a simple explanation.

------------------------

Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig wrote:

"**Let us examine this parking lot. It was leased by Deputy Sheriff B. D. Gossett. He in turn rented parking space by the month to the deputies who worked in the court house, except for official vehicles. I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys**."

At least 2 chapters of the 9/11 cOmmission Report were based in large part on testimony gained via TORTURE--which makes the evidence" inadmissible.

Senator Bob Graham also wrote a book about how the investigation by the Senate-House Joint Intelligence Committee was never allowed to investigate fully due to Bush/Cheney/CIA/FBI foot dragging.

Anyone who has looked into the facts KNOWS that the CIA and the DIA both knew some of the hijackers were in the U.S. in January 2000--but both the DIA and the CIA failed to notify the FBI that there were al qaeda in the U.S. The DIA operation which identified the hijackers was called ABLE DANGER--both cbs and cnn ran stories on the program in August of 2005: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME0iKZdoYXs </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just look at William Blums Table of Contents page from his book [*KILLING HOPE: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions since WWII*](http://williamblum.org/books/killing-hope#toc)

Most Americans simply are too brainwashed to understand our complicity in so many conflicts (and so many deaths) across the globe. Even today, the good ol U.S.A. has military or covert operations running in at least 132 countries. 

Two other excellent books to start out on would be *OVERTHROW: Americas Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq* by Stephen Kinzer and *LEGACY OF ASHES: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner. 

In terms of the surveillance state--theres a Frontline documentary called *Top Secret America* (2013) which gives a great look at the rapid expansion of the intelligence sector after 9/11...http://video.pbs.org/video/2365004424/

Im assuming Russell mentioned 9/11 in his book and the host wanted to drop that question in to make him look like a fool.

----------------

In American history there are two types of events. There are ordinary events which the information systems of the country can understand and transmit. There are also deep events, or meta-events, which the mainstream information systems of the country cannot digest. I mean by a deep event one in which it is clear from the outset that there are aspects which will not be dealt with in the mainstream media, and will be studied only by those so-called conspiracy theorists who specialize in deep history.

2. Wondering if you think the victims (and their families) have been silenced with a non-disclosure agreement which Feinbergs 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund may have contained...

To question what exactly happened shouldnt be seen in a negative light. To be clear: the 9/11 question he largely just sidestepped--but it seems likely he wrote something in his book which definitely questions the Official Story.

9/11 was the Crime of the fucking Century--how many CSI and reality crime shows do people watch mindlessly every night? But to question real life crimes which actually matter is frowned upon because the media has brainwashed the citizens.  </TEXT>

--------------

In 1949, the CIA installed a pro-American colonel, Adib Shishakli, as the Syrian leader. He won direct American military assistance along with covert financial aid. The CIA station chief in Damascus, Miles Copeland, called the colonel "a likeable rogue" who "had not, to my certain knowledge, ever bowed down to a graven image. He had, however, committed sacrilege, blasphemy, murder, adultery and theft." He lasted four years before he was overthrown by Ba'ath Party and communist politicians and military officers. 

In March 1955, Allen Dulles predicted that the country was "ripe for a military coup d'etat" supported by the agency. In April 1956, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt and his British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) counterpart Sir George Young tried to mobilize right-wing Syrian army officers; the CIA delivered half a million Syrian pounds to the leaders of the plot. But the Suez fiasco poisoned the political climate in the Middle East, pushed Syria closer to the Soviets, and forced the Americans and the British to postpone their plan at the end of October 1956.

In the spring and summer of April 1957,they revived it. A document discovered in 2003 among the private papers of Duncan Sandys, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's defense secretary, spells out their effort in detail.

Syria had to be "made to appear as the sponsor of plots, sabotage and violence directed against neighbouring governments," it said. CIA and SIS would manufacture "national conspiracies and various strong-arm activities" in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and blame them on Syria. They would create paramilitary factions and spark revolts among the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus. The creation of the appearance of instability would destabilize the government; border clashes manufactured by American and British intelligence would serve as a pretext for the pro- Western armies of Iraq and Jordan to invade. The CIA and SIS envisioned that any new regime they installed would likely "rely first upon repressive measures and arbitrary exercise of power" to survive.

Roosevelt identified Abdul Hamid Serraj, the longtime chief of the Syrian intelligence service, as the most powerful man in Damascus. Serraj was to be assassinated,along with the chief of the Syrian general staff and the head of the Communist Party.

The CIA sent Rocky Stone, who had cut his teeth in the Iran operation, to serve as the new chief of station in Damascus. Accredited as a diplomat, a second secretary at the American embassy, he used promises of millions of dollars and unlimited political power to befriend officers in the Syrian army. He represented his recruits in reports to headquarters as a crack corps for an American-backed coup.

Abdul Hamid Serraj saw through Stone in a matter of weeks.
The Syrians set up a sting. "The officers with whom Stone was deal- ing took his money and then went on television and announced that they had received this money from the 'corrupt and sinister Americans' in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria," said Curtis F. Jones, a State Department officer sent to clean up the mess Stone left behind. Serraj's forces surrounded the American embassy in Damascus, seized Stone, and interrogated him roughly. He told them everything he knew. The Syrians identified him publicly as an American spy posing as a diplomat, a veteran of the CIA's coup in Iran, and a conspirator with Syrian army officers and politicians to overthrow the government in exchange for millions of dollars in American aid.

The revelation of this "particularly clumsy CIA plot," in the words of the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Charles Yost, had consequences that reverberate today. The Syrian government formally declared Rocky Stone persona non grata. That was the first time that an American diplomat of any stripebe he a spy working undercover or a bona fide State Department officerhad been expelled from an Arab nation. In turn, the United States expelled the Syrian ambassador to Washington, the first expulsion of any foreign diplomat from Washington since World War I. The United States denounced Syria's "fabrications" and "slanders." Stone's Syrian co-conspirators, including the former president, Adib Shishakli, were sentenced to death. A purge of every military officer who had ever been associated with the American embassy followed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could the 2 year+ delay of the official 9/11 Commission also have served to allow the CIA-NSA-DoD Cabal to neutralize any individuals stepping forward with information which the Cabal didnt want to become public? 

from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):

The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.

<TEXT> According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)

**THREAT INFLATION**

------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

Seems to be pure Fearmongering 101...INFLATE the threat and fund some more Defense/Intelligence NOW!!!

The 2014 National Security Budgets of the U.S. and Russia are estimated at:

**FACT:**  U.S. has gone over $1 TRILLION for 2014 (if the last $65 Billion goes through that Obama requested for Defense in early July goes through).

**FACT:**  Russias 2014 National Security Budget is not even at $75 Billion

SO, the U.S. spends OVER 10X what Russia is spending on National Security in 2014. In fact, the additional $65 Billion Obama recently requested is almost the *entire* amount that Russia will spend for National Security in all of 2014.

<TEXT> Quote from *Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency* by Barton Gellman...page 312

---------------

If you rule that way, the blood of the hundred thousand people who die in the next attack will be on your hands. 

--David Addington attempting to ensure the Presidents Spy Program is renewed while speaking to Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith...page 294

--------

Mike Hayden and Vito Potenza drove down from Fort Meade after lunch on February 19, 2004, to give Jim Comey his first briefing on the program. In the Justice Departments sixth-floor SCIF, Hayden got Comeys attention fast. 

Im so glad youre getting read in, because now I wont be alone at the table when John Kerry is elected president, he said. The witness table, Hayden meant. Congressional hearing, investigation of some kind. Nothing good. Kerry had the Democratic nomination just about locked up and was leading Bush in national polls. Hardly anyone believed the next administration would climb as far out on a legal limb as this one had. That was one reason Hayden pushed for some kind of congressional notification.

<TEXT> In a May 2011 speech, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates described the Pentagons business operations as an amalgam of fiefdoms without centralized mechanisms to allocate resources, track expenditures, and measure results.  My staff and I learned that it was nearly impossible to get accurate information and answers to questions such as How much money did you spend and How many people do you have? 

http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2

A search in the Budget Overview document for the word "audit," for example, will take you to page 7-34, among others, where you will find that DOD set a goal of reaching 100 percent readiness to audit its assets and liabilities by the year 2017, but the last column shows that the indicator of progress made toward that goal in FY 2010 was deleted at the request of the Comptroller, who happens to be the chief financial officer of DOD! Furthermore, the auditability asserted for 2017 would not include any audits of specific weapons programs!
The Pentagon Labyrinth (2011) is a free book edited by Winslow Wheeler--its about 100 pages (great read):

<TEXT> This article in the *Washington Free Beacon* was the only source of info (all other articles merely repeated the vague details from the Free Beacon)

http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cia-official-dies-in-apparent-suicide/

Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the article: 11:46 PM on a Friday night. It was also just one day after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There was also some hearings on Benghazi that week as well...

So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past month?

<TITLE> STILL No Follow Up to April 4th Article: A Senior CIA Official Has Died in an Apparent Suicide (the day after vote to release Senate CIA Torture Report) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-16 19:09:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Very suspicious timing for release of this info as well--article was published at 11:46 on a Friday evening...All follow-up articles were derived from this original Washington Free Beacon article and no other info has been published--**no name/age/sex of victim, no date or time of death, no location of incident, no official cause of death**...

A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.

CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.

We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done, White told the Washington Free Beacon. He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.

A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.

Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agencys elite spying branch.

The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.

The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.

No other details of the death could be learned.

The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.

Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agencys computers that were being used in the investigation.

The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.

The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.

The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agencys role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.

Morrell testified that subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.

The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.

Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agencys role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.

<TITLE> Q: Its 1961, the height of the Cold War--the U.S. has 40 Atlas/Titan ICBMs...how many ICBMs did the Soviets have? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-25 05:07:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)

**THREAT INFLATION**

------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

(I would have linked the full cbs interview if I wasnt so *opposed* to cbs--but I would encourage you to watch it)

<TEXT> from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):

The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. **The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA**, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.

-------------------

The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture  and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.

The CIA has blocked release of the Senates torture report for years. In addition, it has taken many other actions to try to keep the lid on the torture program.

For example, the CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, but falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations.

9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote:

*Those who knew about those videotapes  and did not tell us about them  obstructed our investigation*.

Government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.

(And **the chairs of both the 9/11 Commission and the Official Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 said that Soviet-style government minders obstructed the investigation into 9/11 by intimidating witnesses**. We believe that some of the minders were from the CIA.)

--------------

The committees preference was for the CIA to turn over all responsive documents to the committees office, as had been done in previous committee investigations.

Director Panetta proposed an alternative arrangement: to provide literally millions of pages of operational cables, internal emails, memos, and other documents pursuant to the committees document requests at a secure location in Northern Virginia. We agreed, but insisted on several conditions and protections to ensure the integrity of this congressional investigation.

Per an exchange of letters in 2009, then-Vice Chairman Bond, then-Director Panetta, and I agreed in an exchange of letters that the CIA was to provide a stand-alone computer system with a network drive segregated from CIA networks for the committee that would only be accessed by information technology personnel at the CIAwho would not be permitted to share information from the system with other [CIA] personnel, except as otherwise authorized by the committee.

It was this computer network that, notwithstanding our agreement with Director Panetta, was searched by the CIA this past January, and once before which I will later describe.

In addition to **demanding that the documents produced for the committee be reviewed at a CIA facility**, the CIA also insisted on conducting a multi-layered review of every responsive document before providing the document to the committee. This was to ensure the CIA did not mistakenly provide documents unrelated to the CIAs Detention and Interrogation Program or provide documents that the president could potentially claim to be covered by executive privilege.

...the CIAs torture program ended up deceiving the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimonyyet published it as if it were Gospel.

New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek that the 9/11 Commission Report was unreliable because most of the information was based on the statements of tortured detainees.

As NBC News reported:

* Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured.

* At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being tortured.

* One of the Commissions main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ.

* The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves.

John Brennan, the director of the CIA, said the claims by members of the Senate intelligence committee were spurious and wholly unsupported by the facts, and went as far as suggesting the committee itself may have been guilty of wrongdoing.

The battle stems from a hotly contested report into the use of torture by the CIA in the interrogations it carried out after 9/11, whose conclusions are so explosive that it has yet to be declassified, despite exhortations from the White House that a summary should be published. 

Earlier on Wednesday reports surfaced that the CIA inspector general had opened an inquiry, said to have been referred to the justice department, into claims that CIA employees had acted improperly. Suggestions that the CIA had monitored the computer networks of committee staffers had shocked the senators that sit on the panel. Some observers believe that such actions might be criminal.

Senator Mark Udall, a member of the committee who has been vocal in his critism of the CIA, had earlier written to Barack Obama alleging that the president knew about the unprecedented action carried out by the agency.

<TEXT> Phase 1 means canceling your cable--because cnn, fox, cbs, abc, nbc all still get paid (even if you don't watch them). All MSM webpages and newspapers would be boycotted as well--they have FAILED us and do not deserve our money or support. If there was a widespread boycott the MSM would start paying attention to us!!! This seems even more important now that we are no longer FREE to assemble without fearing our own government SPYING on us.

Phase 2 demands an independent investigation of 9/11 and all of the crimes which surround it including the financial and war crimes of the Bush/Cheney administration. The hearings must be open and under oath--no hiding behind closed doors. We, the People deserve to know our true history--in fact, we have PAID for it with our tax dollars and our soldiers lives. 

Phase 3 will lead where the evidence points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S. Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers.

<TEXT> Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S. Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

<TEXT> 1. President Truman created the CIA in 1947--but he also approved a secret codicil in the Marshall Plan of 1948 which allowed the CIA to ransack at least 5% of the $16.5 Billion the plan was given to rebuild 16 cities in Europe and 3 in Asia. The amount the CIA received was at least $680 million--big money back in those days, but it also helped spread their political slush money around the world. Truman was quite naive when it came to the CIA--his early director appointees exited the agency quickly. Truman exhibited his reservations about the CIA 15 years later: exactly one month after JFK was whacked he wrote an editorial in the Washington Post seriously questioning the activities of the CIA:
"For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas." 
http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html

2. Eisenhower warns of the Military Industrial Complex in his final statement as President. He also spoke the words "I want to resign" after being caught in a CIA lie about U2 flights over USSR. Eisenhower was a WWII war hero with NO political experience. He appointed Allen Dulles as director of central intelligence and his brother J.F. Dulles as secretary of state. The U.S., in short order, overthrew Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954. Eisenhower also OK'd the assassinations of Patrice Lumumba and Fidel Castro on the same day. http://lippard.blogspot.com/2007/08/brief-history-of-cia-1953-1961.html So--to recap--that's 2 presidents, and BOTH of them definitely fucking felt betrayed by the MIC...we all know what happened to the 3rd, JFK...

3. JFK was whacked--most likely with the CIA leading the pack: 
The Secret Service stood down.
Dallas and Texas law enforcement stood down.
Military intelligence, which is normally enrolled to provide presidential security, stood down.
The FBI stood down.
These elements opened the door to the assassination, but did not have the resources to deliver the shooters and the complicated cover story and witness elimination program that followed.
Corrupt elements of the CIA and their long term friends and colleagues in organized crime did.
And they did it because their very survival was at stake. http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/11/21/jfk-assassination-the-death-of-hope/

4. So out of the first 3 presidents in the post-WWII era: Truman regretted creating the CIA, Eisenhower was glad to retire because of the CIA/MIC bullshit; and JFK was fucking DEAD. Next up: LBJ. Somehow he found the time to sell his Halliburton stock on 11-22-63--but don't worry he still made $6 million in General Dynamics stock (about $60 million in today's dollars) after he amped up the war in Vietnam. In Octorber 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr earned a Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign against racism--MLK was the youngest man to receive the prize. Unfortunately, MLK also received a blackmail letter sent by the FBI--the letter also called for MLK to commit suicide and the content of the letter is still partially redacted to this day. In April of 1967 MLK began to vociferously oppose the war in Vietnam. Operation Minaret was run by the NSA and placed MLK, Whitney Young, U.S. Senators, anti-war protestors, Muhammad Ali--and even journalists under surveillance. The NSA had been created in 1952--by the mid-60's they were already shredding the U.S. Constitution. In April, 1968 MLK was assassinated--there is now a great deal of evidence which points towards the FBI and the U.S. military being the assassins. Before America could catch it's breath--just 4 months later-- Robert Kennedy was assassinated, too. RFK had been leading in the democratic party race for the presidential election. RFK posed a double threat because he was speaking out against Vietnam--but he might also run an actual investigation into his brother's killing if RFK had been elected. America was caught in a useless war, it's leaders were being shot down, the public was protesting at the White House and the Pentagon. LBJ, in one of his last interviews at the White House, admitted to Walter Cronkite that he thought there might have been a conspiracy to kill JFK. Like the Warren Commission, the truth was kept from the public and the footage wouldn't air until after LBJ's own death. 

4. Nixon gets caught up in Watergate--an obvious CIA set-up. Why would Nixon send known CIA operatives to break-in to DNC headquarters and allow them to do so in such sloppy fashion? How does ONE security guard catch FIVE burglars? Why would "professional" burglars carry so many direct links to the CIA and the White House? http://www.salon.com/2012/05/05/watergates_final_mystery/

5. Carter is undercut by Reagan's plot to free the Iranian hostages (Reagan's VP was GHW Bush--a former CIA director). Reagan breaks his own rule: "We do not negotiate with terrorists"...before he even enters the White House:
But its how Gates began his meteoric rise in the U.S. intelligence community during the Reagan years that has remained most cloaked in mystery. As a young CIA official in 1980, Gates was implicated in secret maneuvers to sabotage President Jimmy Carters negotiations to free 52 U.S. hostages then held in Iran, a failure by Carter that doomed his reelection. Gates was identified as one of the participants in a key October 1980 meeting in Paris allegedly also involving William Casey, who was then Reagans campaign director; George H.W. Bush, a former CIA director and then-Reagans vice presidential running mate; Iranian emissary Mehdi Karrubi; and Israeli intelligence officers, including Ari Ben-Menashe who later testified under oath about what he witnessed.http://consortiumnews.com/2013/06/08/second-thoughts-on-october-surprise/

6. Reagan/Bush manage to cover up Iran-Contra. CIA/military fingerprints all over this one. If the truth had come out--GHWB would most likely NOT have been elected President (and the republicans would have been seriously wounded in next election). http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm

7. GHW Bush is President--U.S. goes to war with Iraq. In re-election campaign Ross Perot mysteriously decides to withdraw from the election (was he threatened?). He then re-enters which splits the vote--and Clinton is elected.

8. Clinton--was the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal a CIA-NSA-neocon operation to assure republican victory in the next election? $40 million spent to investigate. As the impeachment vote is taking place in the House of Representatives--the Speaker (a republican) resigns due to his own sexual dalliances--was this all designed to insure a republican victory in the upcoming elections?

9. GW Bush/Cheney elected--U.S. goes to war with Afghanistan and Iraq. $13 million spent to investigate 9/11 while TRILLIONS are spent on the MIC...

10. Rumors swirl that Obama told his donors "I don't want to end up like Martin Luther King." Press fails to even ask him if the rumor is true. Is the President of the United States of America being controlled by the CIA-NSA-DoD??? http://mondoweiss.net/2013/06/reneged-progressive-promises.html </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

------------------

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth." </TEXT>

I worked for Booz Allen Hamilton as an infrastructure analyst for NSA in Hawaii...I've been a systems engineer, systems administrator, senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency, solutions consultant, and a telecommunications informations system officer."

2. **U.S. Marine--Blaine Cooper:**  "Hi, Mr. McCain. I mean this with all due respect (to you) as an elected official of our country. We, the people want you to be representative of the people--and for this great nation. But for far too long now the rest of Congress, including the executive branch along with the judicial and legislative--have turned your back on the American people and their core values and principles. i can say, with great confidence, and speak on behalf of all Americans that your actions against this country are treasonous. All of you--against the will of the American people--have aided and abetted the enemy. You and the rest of Congress, including the President of the United States, have went against the will of your people in Syria. Regardless of your position and vote (whether it is a "yes" or "no") is still a political smokescreen. I Believe wholeheartedly you do not care about the will and well-being of America or it's people. You lie to the American people about chemical attacks in Syria. The American people know that it was our government that is most responsible. There is strong evidence, including video, that these attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda and you advocate starting war, maybe even world war, by taking the same attack and blaming it on Assad. President Barack Hussein Obama has been supporting terrorism. The United States has been funding and aiding organizations including the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda for many years now--the same enemy we're supposed to be defeating on the battlefield. At least one country in this world stood up against this government terrorism that you guys support in Egypt...(cont.)

3. **Russ Tice**: "They went after high ranking military officers. They went after members of congress. The Senate and the House - especially on the intelligence committees, and on the armed services committees and judicial. But they went after other ones too. They went after lawyers and law firms. Heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. One of the judges is now sitting on the supreme court that I had his wiretap information in my hand. Two are former FISA court judges. They went after state department officials. They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House - their own people! They went after anti-war groups. They went after US companies that do international business around the world. They went after US banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs like the red cross and people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few anti-war civil rights groups...Now here's the big one...June 20th interview on Boiling Frogs...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPyxeqcCjkc (full 1hr+ radio interview)

4. **Cornell West:** "We elected a black president and that means we are less racist now than we used to be. That's beautiful. But when you look at the prison industrial complex and the new Jim Crow: levels of massive unemployment and the decrepit unemployment system, indecent housing: white supremacy is still operating in the US, even with a brilliant black face in a high place called the White House. He is a brilliant, charismatic black brother. He's just too tied to Wall Street. And at this point he is a war criminal. You can't meet every Tuesday with a killer list and continually have drones drop bombs. You can do that once or twice and say: 'I shouldn't have done that, I've got to stop.' But when you do it month in, month out, year in, year out  that's a pattern of behaviour. I think there is a chance of a snowball in hell that he will ever be tried, but I think he should be tried and I said the same about George Bush. These are war crimes. We suffer in this age from an indifference toward criminality and a callousness to catastrophe when it comes to poor and working people."http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/13/cornel-west-they-say-i-am-unamerican

5. **Richard Belzer**: "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles." (last 3 minutes of 15 minute May, 2013 interview: http://www.politico.com/multimedia/video/2013/05/richard-belzer-book-tackles-jfk-conspiracies.html)

6. **Thomas Drake**: "From the recent disclosures of Edward Snowden, the US government has routinely violated on a vast industrial scale the Constitutional protections afforded its own citizens, while also disregarding the internal integrity of other states and the fundamental rights of non-US citizens. I know. Because I was eyewitness to the very foundations of a persistent surveillance state greatly expanded in the deepest of secrecy right after 9/11. I was there at the beginning." (Must See 16 minute speech before EU Parliament Sept. 30, 3013...speech/full transcript at:http://www.whistleblower.org/blog/44-2013/2981-nsa-whistleblower-thomas-drake-statement-before-eu-parliament-committee)

7. **Paul Sperry:** "The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found incontrovertible evidence that Saudi government officials  not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers employed by the kingdom  helped the hijackers both financially and logistically. The intelligence files cited in the report directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war."

8. **Tegan Mathis**: "America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy. In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade...The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise! ...But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy. Here's the other thing: Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination. Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.)...Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President. When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about. With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP). In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins. That's really all there is to it. (Tegan Mathis wrote: *Against Them: How   Why Alexander Haig, Bob Woodward, Donald Rumsfeld,   Richard Cheney Covered Up the JFK Assassination in the Wake of the Watergate Break-In*...from comments posted in May 9, 2013 article by Russ Baker... http://whowhatwhy.com/2013/05/09/jfk-rfk-mlk-the-questions-remain/)

9. **Preston James, Ph D**: The sealed executive sessions of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it...When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?  That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film. (posted in comments of article titled "The JFK War: The Case of Federal Judge John Tunheim" by Dr. James Fetzer on VeteransToday.com...http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/05/15/the-jfk-war-the-case-of-federal-judge-john-tunheim/)...



---------------------

These quotes shocked me and made me question what the TRUTH really is. 2013 was filled with Snowden revelations--but there were quotes from other veteran NSA whistleblowers as well which corroborated what Snowden was saying. It was also 50 years since JFK being assassinated--these quotes about JFK made me think about the possibilities...

edit: might be best just to type your favorite quote and let them be upvoted...be a good idea to double-check and see if they were actually written/spoken in 2013 (all of these definitely were--the date can be found in the link)...

<TEXT> "Regarding possible conspiracies, to this day I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. I certainly have doubts that he was motivated to do that by himself. Im not sure if anybody else was involved. I dont go down that road, with respect to the grassy knoll theory and all of that, but I have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald. I think he was inspired somewhere by something, but I cant pin anything down on that. Ive never spent a lot of time on it. But I think, after a certain period of time, and that period of time may well have passed, **it is totally appropriate for a country like the United States to open up the files** on whatever history can be shed light on. I think that is appropriate. It has to be done in the right way, by the right entities or people, but certainly by a valid historian or for some valid analysis; I think that everybody would benefit."

<TEXT> "Intelligence is a sacred cow...The CIA isn't worth a damn." --Nixon

Nixon fired Richard Helms on Nov. 20, 1972 but allowed Helms to stay on until March 1973. On Nov. 21, Nixon appointed his own man to the CIA--James Schlesinger, and told him to "Get rid of the clowns. What use are they? They've got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers."

Schlesinger then sent out a memo at the Agency part of which read:

I have ordered all senior operating officials of this Agency to report to me immediately on any activities now going on, or that have gone on in the past, which might be construed to be outside the legislative charter of this Agency.

I hereby direct every person presently employed by CIA to report to me on any such activities of which he has knowledge. I invite all ex-employees to do the same. Anyone who has such knowledge should call...and say that he wishes to tell me about "activities outside CIA's charter." </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary *could be invented*. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." (emphasis mine)

--George F. Kennan in preface of Norman Cousins's 1987 book The Pathology of Power

The implications of this quote definitely startled me a bit when I first came across these words about a year ago. After looking up his wikipedia and learning Kennan was a career diplomat and historian--he seemed to be an influential insider who helped mold the Truman Doctrine and thrusted the U.S. into the Cold War. But Kennan was more than a player in creating U.S. foreign policy after WWII--he was actually at vital meetings that helped create a brutal, under-handed agency mindframe that was often out of control.

It wasn't until I read **Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** (2007) that Kennan lost the gentlemanly diplomatic facade and was exposed as something quite sinister. The book contains a quote from a 1948 secret report which was sent to the U.S. State Dept, the White House and the Pentagon in which Kennan called for "the inauguration of organized political warfare". Another memo sent to Sec. of Defense Forrestal called for the formation of "a guerrilla warfare corps". Obviously, these are much different purposes than what the original function of the CIA was stated to be--an intelligence agency updating the President on world events.

Even if you know some of the sordid details of the CIA--Tim Weiner's book *Legacy of Ashes* will make it quite clear that Kennan's memos were taken seriously--and if only HALF of what Tim Weiner writes is true then America has been subjected to the biggest CON JOB ever. The book weighs in at 809 pages with almost 200 pages of notes/sources and much of the info is from the CIA's own files. It begins with the end of WWII and proceeds chronologically without getting bogged down in code names. Direct quotes are used often, sometimes they even jump off the page: "We killed thousands of Communists, even though half of them probably didn't know what Communism meant. (CIA pilot Al Pope)".

After reading the first 60 pages it's stunning how the CIA was able to disregard all laws and procedures in the U.S. to get initial funding. For the first year or two Wall Street bankers were asked to chip in by sending a million or so overseas--then they could mark a special code on their tax form and write it off. Other familiar names quickly enter the picture--Allan Dulles, John Foster Dulles, Richard Helms, Richard Bissell. The drive for power was matched by the increase in funding--by 1948 the CIA had somehow ransacked 5% of the Marshall Plan money which came out to $680 million over 4 years through a secret clause.

So, right from the start, the CIA finances were crooked, Americans--often even the President and congress-- unaware. The stated mission of intelligence gathering was taking a backseat for much higher stakes of assassination, funding/training militia groups--laws simply did not apply in any way to the CIA. The Agency was gambling and it's actions were often sloppy and self-defeating. The enemy was anyone who didn't openly reject communism and bend over for American business. From Japan to Iran to Guatemala to the Congo--the Agency poured in cash to political parties and journalists. If that didn't work the proper militias or henchmen were supplied with weapons and hired.

As I pondered the first three chapters of Legacy of Ashes two questions raced through my mind: can the U.S. possibly be much deeper in debt than the $17 Trillion they are telling us? Secondly, could 9/11 have been perpetrated by the CIA to destroy (permanently) financial records and to further fund the defense/intelligence sectors?

The reason I ask these questions is because of the enormous economic fraud from the inception of the CIA which was perpetrated by the Dulles brothers and the Wall Street bankers who backed the Agency. On top of that is the fact that the CIA is but one of a myriad of defense and intelligence arms of the U.S. and you have to question why Americans have not demanded an open audit immediately. Just in the intelligence/homeland security field there are now well over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors churning out over 50,000 reports a year. The Dept. of Defense has no actual audit in recent memory--though there are rumors an audit was made in 1993. No one has ever seen an actual audit for the CIA (let alone the entire defense/intelligence budget). Even today, the CIA's budget total is written on a piece of paper and then shown to a senior senator of the Intelligence Committee--no one else (outside of the CIA and possibly the President). Now multiply that process 20 or 30 times for all the other major U.S. Government agencies.

*Legacy of Ashes* proves the President has often been oblivious to the plans being played out by the CIA. Justice has been subverted--every law in the U.S. and internationally has been laughed at and spat upon while the party goes on in CIA mansions around the world. After just one dozen years of existence the CIA had played the politics of fear so successfully that Eisenhower was giving the OK to assassinate Lumumba (leader of Congo) and Fidel Castro in just one meeting. There's a reason they won't release most of the files for 50 or 60 years--because the citizens of the U.S. and the world would demand an actual investigation (one which doesn't involve puppets).

The dangerous threat these defense and intelligence agencies present to freedom and democracy--especially when added to the Edward Snowden revelations--should stop you in your tracks. I highly suggest you read the book and seriously consider the implications of these agencies being allowed such an extreme lack of accountability. In the end even Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had many regrets over their dealings with the Agency--Truman regretted creating it and Eisenhower even blurted out "I would like to resign" after he had been burned (and exposed) by a CIA operation which involved the U2 spy plane.

<TEXT> do you honestly think that after 50 years the American press is going to tell you the TRUTH???

there may be journalists who tried--but in the end it is the editors   publishers decision what to print.

we know from Russ Tice that the editors just run to the government to get approval--so QUIT watching American media--it's PROPAGANDA.

there is a reason "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" was made in England.

there is a reason "The Dark Side of JFK" was published in Europe.

the TRUTH cuts too deep. the TRUTH shakes the walls at the the three letter agencies.

the TRUTH will NOT be revealed on cnn or cbs or abc...

<TEXT> "The NSA must be shattered into a billion pieces and it's leaders who violated the law immediately brought to justice. It must be defunded and **the thievery must stop**. Over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors have **screwed the taxpayers** out of TRILLIONS since 9/11. On top of that, the American taxpayer has been funding Industrial Espionage for private corporations. As a **Final Insult**, millions of Americans have repeatedly been spied on and victimized without due process of law being followed." </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example: how did the government cover up the JFK plot?

EASY--they intimidated witnesses and monitored everyone's phone   mail. Certainly makes killing those who knew too much a lot easier. Makes "journalists"  much easier to control as well. Covering-up 200 deaths over the next 15 years becomes pretty easy too.

We are finally finding out the lengths the government will go to control us--by spying on Martin Luther King, active U.S. senators, public figures like John Lennon and Muhammad Ali. Even the Smothers Brothers QUIT rather than continue having their work chiseled down every week by the TV censors. I'll bet even Oliver Stone is thinking about WHY he had such a hard time making "Apocalypse Now". No wonder it was so easy for the "film reviewers" to berate and belittle "JFK" when it came out--they most likely had the script for months before seeing the movie.

Then there's the journalists--who have been spied on, harassed and sometimes even killed. From Dorothy Killeen to Michael Hastings--I even recently saw "Dirty Wars" by Jeremy Scahill where he is harassed during the filming of his documentary. Ever wonder why reporters don't "follow the money" into the Pentagon or CIA???

It is becoming clear that the "news" is pure propaganda that is approved ultimately by government agencies--there is NO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS--it is a mirage.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Booz Allen's 9/11 Links </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-16 04:04:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> excerpt from washington post/business...

Booz Allen, based in Tysons Corner, has been a local fixture for years, employing thousands and providing management and consulting services to the government, particularly the defense and intelligence agencies. It even sponsored a local golf tournament  the Booz Allen Classic  between 2004 and 2006. It also became a leader among the contractors supplying tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to the government in recent years, including technologists such as Snowden.

Those government contracts, and thousands more like them, in 2008 made Booz Allen a ripe acquisition target for Carlyle Group. It paid **$2.54 billion** for Booz Allen as a deep recession took hold. Fearing the risks of taking on too much debt in the midst of a financial crisis, Carlyle put up **50 percent cash** instead of its normal 30 percent. It borrowed the rest to buy the company, which was then privately held.

Upon the close of the deal, the less profitable international and commercial business was spun off to become Booz   Co., leaving Carlyle with a government-only company. After the split, the new Booz Allen Hamilton established an **incentive-based compensation** structure that gave the remaining partners a stake in the firms success. In effect, said one person close to the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly, **you got to eat what you killed**. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-11/business/39896957_1_carlyle-group-nsa-firm

-----------------------------

excerpt from the guardian june 10, 2013...by julian borger...

**The current director of national intelligence (DNI), James Clapper**, who issued a stinging attack on the intelligence leaks this weekend, is a former Booz Allen executive. The firm's **current vice-chairman, Mike McConnell, was DNI under the George W Bush administration**. He worked for the Virginia-based company before taking the job, and returned to the firm after leaving it. The company website says McConnell is responsible for its "rapidly expanding cyber business".

**James Woolsey, a former CIA director** was also a Booz Allen vice-president, and Melissa Hathaway, another former company executive also once worked as the top aide on cybersecurity to McConnell when he was DNI. The company headquarters in the leafy Washington suburb of McLean in northern Virginia, close to CIA headquarters and home to former and current intelligence officers.

Snowden's decision to reveal his identity as a computer systems administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, directly handling National Security Agency IT systems, raises significant image problems for the **$6bn company** and its 25,000-strong staff, which has traded on a bond of trust with sensitive clients, particularly the intelligence establishment. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden

----------------------------------

and for those that may have forgotten: **On the morning of 9/11/2001 GHW Bush** was at a Carlyle Group meeting in a DC hotel with a close friend of the family--one of the bin Ladens... wonder how much money the Bushes, the Cheneys, the Clappers (etc, etc, etc) have made off of the private defense/intell companies that they pump and milk the U.S. Gov't for...

after the Snowden leaks began there was a doc released by cryptome that was a financial tally of incoming checks for Booz Allen--the payments started Sept. 14th, 2001.

http://cryptome.org/2013/07/Presidents-Spy-Program-Sept14-2001.htm

the link to the **pdf file is at the very very BOTTOM of the page**...also--originally--both of the documents contained Absolutely NO strike-outs!!!

when you open the pdf....Sept. 14, 2001 is on page 152...from what i could see at least 390K was placed in the month of Sept, 2001--there may be more i didn't see... </TEXT>

<TITLE> LHO Character Assassination Begins: MSM Begins Onslaught of Propaganda Scripted to Avoid Any Serious Inquiry...(Top 3 Free Documentaries to Watch) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-12 01:59:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Top 3 JFK free documentaries on youtube...

1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAnX7atkpyA

2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2agPurqFJk

3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBxMJFQd04 ...(Part 6 of "Evidence of Revision" is 2hrs8mins--some versions cut off the end)...

------------------------------

29 Rare   Out-of-Print Books (free pdf) by Robert Morrow: 29 books FREE!!! My favorite so far is *How JFK Was Killed* by Joachin Joestin (who also wrote *The Dark Side of LBJ*)...also includes a list of over 1,000 books on the JFK Assassination...President Hoover's writings on the CIA... https://app.box.com/s/8b408e6999f8799dfd0a

*When They Kill A President* by Roger Craig (Dallas County Police Dept.)--...a chilling account of what he experienced on 11-22-63 and up until his death... http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/WTKaP.html

*Getting Him To the Ambush* (Slide show) by Jim Fetzer  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duoDmOd2Muo

*Final Judgement* by Michael Collins Piper..."This book contends that Israel's Mossad was a primary player alongside the CIA and the Lansky Crime Syndicate in the JFK assassination conspiracy and that, in fact, the Mossad's role was probably the driving force behind the conspiracy." ....free pdf... (I'm reading this as a *novel* to expand my theorizing) http://wikispooks.com/w/images/f/f6/Final_Judgment.pdf

<TITLE> SHHHH....behind the Grassy Knoll was a DALLAS COUNTY SHERIFF'S PARKING LOT... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-04 21:44:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "Informed sources in Washington have been leaking stories about the reorganization of the Secret Service for months, forever insisting that all that's needed to prevent a repitition of Dallas is more money, more men, more informers...the Secret Service is feeding a special computer the names and data of all known individuals, groups and organizations who might try to kill the president....Jan 1, 1968 should be a red letter day on the calendar. As from that date, presidential assassinations in the U.S. will no longer be practicable--thanks to the all seeing eyes, all hearing ears and divining brain of the magic robot that will start functioning at Secret Service headquarters that day." (from Prologue, page 9)

**"Since these snipers were operating out of a closed area which was controlled by the police, and was a Sheriff's parking lot, they cannot possibly have been there, or have remained undetected, without police connivance."** (page 21)

"Ever since I first accused (Chief of Police) Curry and his Chief of Homicide J. Will Fritz, of having been directly implicated in the JFK murder, I have been waiting to hear from these gentlemen, or at least one of them, through his lawyer, but alas, in vain." (page 22)
"For even greater effect, my British publisher (took out) a two-page spread...which explicitly invited those named in the book to sue him, and me, for libel so the case could at last be aired in a court of law... There is nothing more frustrating in the world than to not be able to get a libel suit out of somebody you've called a murderer to his face. And a presidential murderer, to boot." (page 23)

"How Kennedy Was Killed" (1968) by Joachim Joesten free pdf......https://app.box.com/s/8b408e6999f8799dfd0a/1/251450825/7711344676/1

Joachim Joesten also wrote the 1968 book *The Dark Side of LBJ* which had to be printed in Europe...

----------------------------

Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig also writes about this...

**"Let us examine this parking lot. It was leased by Deputy Sheriff B. D. Gossett. He in turn rented parking space by the month to the deputies who worked in the court house, except for official vehicles. I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys."**

http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/WTKaP.html

Roger Craig's story is a bit painful to read--he was harassed and terrorized by the FBI or the CIA because he was willing to talk to reporters and tell them what he knew...Roger Craig even went a bit further and did some investigative work for Jim Garrison--and in light of the recent NSA/FBI revelations--maybe what he said in his writing will be seen in a new context... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Harry Truman in Washington Post editorial Dec. 22, 1963...(the editorial only ran in the morning edition--it was pulled from other editions)

For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.

I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. Some of the complications and embarrassment I think we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigueand a subject for cold war enemy propaganda.

With all the nonsense put out by Communist propaganda about "Yankee imperialism," "exploitive capitalism," "war-mongering," "monopolists," in their name-calling assault on the West, the last thing we needed was for the CIA to be seized upon as something akin to a subverting influence in the affairs of other people.

I well knew the first temporary director of the CIA, Adm. Souers, and the later permanent directors of the CIA, Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg and Allen Dulles. These were men of the highest character, patriotism and integrityand I assume this is true of all those who continue in charge.

But there are now some searching questions that need to be answered. I, therefore, would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President, and that whatever else it can properly perform in that special fieldand that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere.
We have grown up as a nation, respected for our free institutions and for our ability to maintain a free and open society. There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.

i may be wrong about the number of foreign military bases--but whatever that number is--we still have a lot of them...even our base in guantanamo is based on stealing and bullying--i think we acquired it  at the end of the Spanish-American War in 1903--the lease may have been signed under duress and does not end (which is illegal) and the payment is $2,000 per year...supposedly, Cuba has cashed only one of these checks and has demanded the lease be torn up ever since.

edit: the contract with cuba was upped to $4,000 in 1934--since then only 1 check has been cashed. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 3 Authors make SHOCKING Comments on JFK Assassination </TITLE>

<TEXT> 1. Comments by **Tegan Mathis** (posted in comment section of an article titled "JFK-RFK-MLK??? The Questions Remain" by Russ Baker on whowhatwhy.com)...

If you want to know the truth about the JFK assassination, here it is:
After the Bay of Pigs, the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Peace Speech, the orders to withdraw troops from Vietnam, etc., America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy.
In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade. The Cuban Brigade was the army of Cuban exiles who carried out the Bay of Pigs operation in 1961.
The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise!

But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy.
**Here's the other thing:** Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination.
Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.)
Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President.

When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about.
With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP).
In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins.
That's really all there is to it. But if you want to know more, read my book, Against Them: How   Why Alexander Haig, Bob Woodward, Donald Rumsfeld,   Richard Cheney Covered Up the JFK Assassination in the Wake of the Watergate Break-In. Or, if it's easier for you to believe that Alexander Haig was a social worker to the Cuban Brigade, that's cool too.

**2.** Comments by **Preston James, Ph D** (posted in comments of article titled "The JFK War: The Case of Federal Judge John Tunheim" by Dr. James Fetzer on VeteransToday.com)...

Excellent article. The sealed executive sessions of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it.

When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The **executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence** is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?

That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.

**3.** "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles."

<TITLE> 3 BEST documentaries on youtube for JFK info... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-24 00:24:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm.

2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds.

3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam.

These 3 films expose the shocking events in many ways the American public was unable to see at the time. The public was not allowed to see the Zapruder film until the mid-1970's (there were only still images released until then). Even 50 years later, there is a great deal of files the government still will NOT release--as if 50 YEARS LATER it is still a national security issue. The films often present evidence the JFK assassination was a COUP D'ETAT and an action which allowed the military, intelligence, financial, and energy sectors to expand their will upon the American people--and the world. You might totally disagree with this conclusion--but to NOT view these films (and do other research) would be a short-sighted failure to question the *official* government version. Authorities have only released info in a painstakingly slow drip-by-drip manner--and has treated Americans like SERFS who do not deserve to know the truth about their own history.

All 3 films dive fearlessly into territories that are difficult for many of us because they challenge our beliefs--which can be threatening. Certainly, to truly begin to understand the events it requires a great deal of thought and a vast storage of memory--but these documentaries take giant leaps into asking the right questions and should leave your brain cells rattling a bit as you realize some of the many theories which directly EXTINGUISH the OSWALD MYTH. (if you have not seen them all docs are FREE on youtube--just be advised to make sure you are watching the FULL version...example: the full version of MLK (part 6) in "E of R" is hard to find and also has rare, shocking photos of lynchings which are presented in a historical context to show the vicious racism which existed into the middle of the 20th century).  </TEXT>
