<TEXT> May 1942, somewhere over the Coral Sea.

The night sky is illuminated and air deafened with speckles of anti-aircraft fire, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress known as the Pacific Pearl and its fellow squadron soar in formation. The right propeller putters to a smoke billowing halt as its struck by enemy artillery. Veteran Pilot, Skip, and Co-Pilot, Holden courageously man their airship through a less than routine bombing run over hostile territory. Two crewmen, within the waste of the aircraft, haphazardly empty their staggered M2 Browning machine guns, blindly hoping to make contact with the deadly streaks of light originating from the ground below. Situated in the belly of the ship, a gunman unleashes lead, oscillating inside the dual mounted, spherical Sperry turret. The plane's tail is battered with stray munitions, yet maintains its course. At the nose of the plane, one nameless patriot mounts his Bendix chin turret, attempting to visualize ground forces. A sudden and forceful explosion of AA canon fire bursts directly in front the Pearl, obliterating the glass and metal comprising the nose and instantaneously ending the life of the bombardier within. Another blast detonates a hole directly at the Boeing's cabin, sending a shock wave of shrapnel into the nearby gunmen. Their bodies contort and rear on the cold metal floor, as their own blood fills their waning breaths. The B-17 wavers to maintain altitude as continued bombardment causes the ship to pollute the air with streaks of smoke and flame.

Come on, Skip! Fly this bucket and get us the hell outta' he-, screams the radio operator prior to him and his quarters being peppered with machine gun fire. His body quivers, as he instinctively grasps the blood oozing from the last bullet entry wound at his right arm. The pain departs, and he becomes unconscious - his body falling limp within his chair.

The bomb bay doors slowly part open, releasing multiple pairs of half ton whistling M44s upon their decent to destruction. The Pacific Pearl, now a war torn tin can of its former glory, limps gingerly away from the theater of battle towards a hopeful full moon. The former fortress and its scant crew rumble forward as pilot and co-pilot can now safely assess the damage.

I think we're hit pretty bad, Skip, says an uncertain Holden.

You better go back and see how bad it is, states Skip.

Okay, Holden responds with a sigh as he stands to remove his headset. Can you keep er' in the air, Skip? Holden inquires, placing a mutually reassuring hand on the pilot's shoulder, making his way to the cabin.

Yeah, yeah, sure... Skip quickly responds.

Upon entering the cabin, Holden is immediately greeted by a crewman face down nearest the cabin entryway floor. Kneeling down to investigate, Holden slowly flips the soldier face up, revealing multiple bloody bullet holes through his chest and one through the eye, directly piercing the man's left glasses frame. Holden jumps to his feet startled, backing away in shock, uncertain what to do but proceed forward. He reluctantly continues through the corridor of the airship, with only the vibrations of the passing air to break the silence. Holden gently creaks open the subsequent chamber's doorway, unveiling two bloodied gunmen lying lifeless across from a sizable hissing breech within the plane's haul. Holden leans against the metallic column connected to the roof of the rig, holding in place one of the bellied turrets. Unable to retract the turret's entrance latch, Holden gives two firm knocks upon the hollow metal alloy.

Nelson? the co-pilot beckons to the gunner, giving three more knocks. No response. Unbeknownst to Holden, the turret operator lays deceased within his glass coffin - a single projectile penetrating the rounded window, into his chest cavity. Holden examines the bodies of the two adjacent gunmen, unwilling to make physical contact as one of the men's eyes remain open, hauntingly gazing into nothingness. He lightly sneaks past the corpses, as if not to disturb their eternal slumber  a passive observer in a surreal reality.

Holden lowers his head making his way towards the tail of the plane. He can see a crewman sitting in a chair, facing away from him, peering out a broken rear window. He nears what he believes to be the first living causality of the day's combat. He rotates the swiveling chair, hoping to arouse an unconscious man. Turning to face him, with mouth hanging ajar and eyes transfixed, the departed crew member's intestines grotesquely protrude from his abdomen. The body falls directly at Holden's knees, splatting as the internal organs spill onto the ground.

Before Holden can react, through the shattered rear glass, a short distance from the plane's tail, he spots what can only be described as a floating orb, glowing a deep mesmerizing green.

Jesus... He shutters to himself in astonishment. Holden reaches for a nearby transmitter, building his courage to speak as he brings it to his mouth. Skip... Something's following us...

What is it? Responds Skip.

It's some, some kind of green meteorite...

What!? Skip gasps. Where? He asks, turning his head in all directions to spot this anomaly. The orb swiftly descends under the aircraft, latching itself to the belly, causing the plane to abruptly jerk in the air. The sharp movement causes multiple compressed air tanks to fall from their shelves, crashing onto Holden, momentarily knocking him unconscious on the ground. The orb begins to pulsate a bright luminescent green energy that begins to engulf sections of the Pacific Pearl. The bodies of the now dead crewmen begin to collectively glow a similar rhythmic translucence.

Holden! Are you okay? Skip beckons over the radio system. Holden's eyes slowly open to consciousness.

Uh...Yeah, Holden groans, shaking his head. I'm coming back, Skip, as he raises his body out from under the air tanks. Skip looks frantically about the cockpit, unable to spot anything unusual outside the aircraft. Holden groggily makes his way towards the front of the vessel. The motionless corpse within the tail of the plane begins to irradiate acid from its body, as if from within, revealing a bony decomposing monstrosity. The claw-like fingers of this previously deceased human begin to quake with life.

Holden, with his head still throbbing from its previous blow, re-enters the waist of the ship, the same haul breech still humming a familiar tune of death. Yet, one obvious detail plagues his already clouded mind. Where were the two dead gunmen? Holden, completely unable to comprehend the difference between truth and reality begins to tremble in a lucid fear. He staggers to turns his body, tiptoeing backwards towards the front of the plane. In his shivering retreat, he is halted with a clank as the back of his boot makes contact with the last known location of Nelson. With one last attempt, either out of spirited curiosity or cowardice fright, Holden crouches to unlatch the turret enclosure. Cautiously he lifts the hatch and peers in. A gut wrenching roar and two ungodly arms grasp him by the coat, heaving Holden into the glass prison. His screams of pain mix with monstrous growls as he's thrashed about. Blood can be seen trickling in droplets from outside the transparent sphere.

What the hell's happening back there!? demands Skip. No response. Shoot, he mutters to himself as he flicks on the Automatic Pilot switch, removing his headset and standing to investigate. As he casually turns the door handle to exit the cockpit, Skip is met face-to-face with a moaning monstrosity that was once one of his crewman. Portions of its skin and tissues have seemingly melted from its body, with only remnants of their uniform and hair covering what appears as a walking, decomposing skeleton. With a reflexive outcry, Skip slams the flight deck door in the beast's face. Left flabbergast, Skip slowly withdrawals to his pilot seat, frantically reaching for his Colt M1911. Trembling, he aims his pistol at the door - of which begins to bend and mold under the force of the atrocity's power. He squeezes his trigger twice, recoiling with each ricocheting discharge. The metallic entrance collapses under the power of the creature, revealing two more fiends lumbering towards the pilot quarters.

With what is seemingly his only remaining option, Skip desperately dons a parachute, opening the emergency exit latch located at his feet. He sits at the edge of a darkened abyss as he takes one last look at what appears to be the walking remains of his deceased crew, snarling and gnashing in a maddening blood lust. With a leap of faith, Skip hurls himself into the cold darkness. Wind rushes past his ears as he plummets towards the earth. He yanks his ripcord. Shortly thereafter, he is jarred by the flutter of his parachute bringing his body to a looming descent. Silhouetted against the first break of dawn, Skip spots the Pacific Pearl  now nothing more than a cascading asteroid.

After what appears to be only a momentary respite, the pilot finds himself making a gentle landing on an unknown tropical beach front. Releasing himself from his pack, Skip stares up at the darkened sky, caressing his own face in awe, as if to affirm to himself that he's still alive. The island is lush with the sounds of populating insects, frogs and birds. He cautiously makes his way towards and through the dense jungle that lay before him. Brushing aside vines, Skip curiously gazes through an opening in the vegetation. The pilot is taken aback in astonishment at what comes into view. From tree line to tree line, as if planted by design, dozens, if not hundreds, of timeworn air crafts lay crashed and abandoned  engulfed by the overgrown flora. Skip begins to drift through the airship graveyard, taking note of military vessels from all makes, models, nations and creeds. Without warning, the squawking of a fearful feathered creature brings him to a heightened alert. Beginning with a low gurgle, Skip hears a familiarly repugnant sound emanating from what appears to be every and all directions. In a frenzy of terror, he becomes aware of bubbling growls accompanied by the crumpling of rustic metal quickly surrounding him. Paralyzed in fear, Skip witnesses hideous mutations of what were once downed pilots, emerge as deforming horrors  rotting skin and musculature held in disarray about the bodies of these once presumably men. Countless numbers of glowing green eyes surround Skip as the bellows of inhumane morbidity grow in cacophony. Years of suppressed fear explode from the bottom of his diaphragm in a voice shattering wail. Yet, the pilot's cries echo into silence, amidst the Coral Sea air. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had recently committed sin to the point where I disgusted myself and the sight of sexuality outside of marriage made me heart broken and I decided to stop PMO. I thought I had it kicked, not doing it for 2 weeks without a sign of weakness. I was so proud. And that was my mistake. I went from one sin of lust, to the sin of pride in my own abilities. But then, I found myself burning with the desire to PMO. I convinced myself that it would be okay to attempt masturbating without any sort of external stimulation or internal fantasy and to just look at it as a bodily necessity. Which ends up just being a statement that I can control my own body the way I want. Which then led to PMO. And now, here I am again. Low. Broken. Fearful of death. Duped by myself and most likely Satan.

I realize the best way to break this is to have the discipline I briefly found, grounded in deep hate for sin and its effects, but also to primarily and forever abide constantly in the peace that is found in what JESUS DID on the cross. Not my own strength. Forgive me.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreeable. But its so confusing, because the old testament does actually discuss the presence of Giants, with actual dimensions and issues they caused the average man. I don't think the word "Giant" was simply discussed in such detail strictly for metaphor. 

I mean, legitimately, there is mention of Giant individuals within the biblical text. I think when I have more time I'll gather up everywhere it mentions Giants in the bible and we'll examine the context and translations together. But I do see your perspective :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> * bn hlhm () the sons of Elohim (**sons of God**)

Genesis 6:2-4 (ESV)

2 the **sons of God** (Angels) saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. 3 Then the Lord said, My Spirit shall not abide in[a] man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years. 4 The Nephilim[b] were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.D

* bn hlhm ( ) the sons of Elohim (**sons of God**)

Job 1:6  (ESV)
Satan Allowed to Test Job
6 Now there was a day when the **sons of God** (Angels) came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[a] also came among them.

There are multiple references throughout the Torah (Old Testament), discussing the presence of entire tribes of giants present before and after the flood. The later references being in Deuteronomy, where in Deut 3:11 -- "Og King of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah"
-- and you of course know the story of David and Goliath (considered to be a descendant of the Anakim, descendants of Nephilim). Goliath being 9.5 feet tall. 

It is with my understanding from the various accounts within the Bible, that the Fallen Angels exited the Heavens, manifesting within the physical realm, to sin against man, and conceive hybrids with the humans. This caused chaos within the Earth, but also could very well corrupt the bloodline of Christ, who needed to be directly descended from Adam. Noah was not a "Perfect man" without sin, but perfect in his adamite genetics. Thus, God preserved Noah's family before the Deluge or flood. 

The Sons of God that Paul references in Romans 8:14 , as you know, are the spiritual sons, adopted into the vine of the church body, through the acceptance of the sacrifice of Yeshua, Jesus Christ.

<TEXT> Genesis 6:4 - "In those days, and for some time after, giant Nephilites lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times."

Giants were a thing in the old Testament. Fallen Angels manifesting themselves within the mortal realm to Sin against man and procreate with humans, creating the hybrid giants. Demons are separate from Fallen Angels. 

What lens of Paul are you talking about? Where does he mention the inaccuracy of legitimate giants within the ancient texts of the old testament/Torah? And where does he mention them as military leaders instead?

There are multiple accounts of Giants within the old testament. A breed of creation used to tarnish the human bloodline of the savior, Jesus. Thus, requiring the Deluge (flood). 

Your interpretations of the old testament giants is rather contrived, in all legitimacy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The context, my friend. The narrative context of creating the world in 7 days is presented in what we may often consider a poetic and metaphorical style of writing that was so common of creation accounts in most religious texts -- and thus, understandably ambiguous. Jesus' encounters with "demons", at least within the context of the scripture, is very hyper specific. That is to say, you can't really derive much meaning from these portions of the gospels other than Jesus was rebuking dark spiritual entities. There's not much room for interpretation, in this context, other than what is explicitly stated.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't write off the possibility of demonic involvement. I remember experiencing this multiple times, having a feeling of another presence within the room, and only alleviating when I called upon the name of Jesus. It also would happen right when I started feeling courageous about my faith and considered stepping out further than my comfort zone. I know /r/christianity likes to take the more naturalistic approach to most topics like this and psych related topics, but remember, we battle against not flesh and blood, but the principalities of spiritual darkness. So, never discount the presence of Lucifer and his minions and look to Jesus in prayer and humility, as his authority is above all - and we are His children. Fear Not.  </TEXT>

Winning the 2015 Hugo Award, This story first it intrigued me, then it amused me, then it gripped me then I laughed out loud. Once complete immersed into the world of the story, I next shared the creatures curiosity, their fear, and finally their awe. I relished every transition, every change in tempo, every interaction, the precision in each characterization. And in the end when I finally understood just what was happening and what it meant I experienced that rare joy that only the best science fiction stories seem to offer: that feeling of a gradually increasing cognitive dissonance due to my assumptions not quite matching up with where the story is going and then the aha moment when I finally understood that the scope of this subcreation is larger and more nuanced than I first anticipated. Its positively rapturous when all the parts that seem out of place just suddenly fall together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're missing the point, friend. You must first ask, did he do anything at all? Or were the Boston bombings a government orchestrated event created to continue to disarm the population and control through the instinctual sense of fear? Luciferian at its core. This boy, and his brother, were simply what they call "fall guys", whom the blame is placed, to divert the true narrative away from the masses. The news reports and we listen. What's to stop satan from polluting that aspect of our life equally so. May God give you discernment. </TEXT>

The only Kingdom that we should trust is a Heavenly one, and I feel its pretty clear that our "great country" no longer holds the interest of "we the people". False Flags are prevalent throughout history and there's always a need for a "fall guy". Notice how we never even heard an appeal from this man. He never once had a voice. Your prayers should be directed towards the mercy of this mans soul for he is dying for a lie. How sorrowful this world is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Friend, you have no idea what has occurred outside the narrative that the media has published to you. Your prayers should be directed towards the individuals that have wrongfully accused this man and that God have mercy on an innocent man. I advise you the only government that should reign truth into your heart is the Lord and His kingdom. All governments and their contrived perspectives of "their people" are simply and undoubtedly under the hand of the Prince of all Lies, Lucifer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Touched on often, but still a continuing question. I've always been curious about how other Christians feel once they've sinned again and knowing they may repeat that sin in the future? Will Jesus continue forgiving us? Or is there a cut off where someone was never saved in the first place? Is this question far too legalistic? Thank you for your responses ahead of time :) </TEXT>

A good place to begin is to read the gospels written of Jesus and to talk to real life christians about why they became christians and how they found truth and spiritual freedom in that belief. YouTube is also awfully useful for good testimonies :) God bless friend! God has already blessed you enough to be curious :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comedy, much like any skill, requires practice. Boys, from a very young age, are encouraged to hone these skills. That's why a woman would dominate a man in interior design, fashion sense and any other activity that a woman is told is normal from the time they can walk. It's 95% societal. Girls get dressed in pink, boys in blue. While subject A is amazing at coordinating outfits and applying eyeliner, subject B is fantastic at making dick jokes. It's all learned behavior, and sure, it may be minutely biologically to some degree, but stand up comedians and runway models don't just WAKE UP on stage one morning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> a montage of 70s scifi elements that might cohesively mesh well together on a YouTube banner with the appropriate dimensions and ratios. Maybe with enough space within the center for the title of the page.
Possibly with horror elements as well!

Thanks! :)

During the Middle Ages, many schemes were proposed, some drawing on and expanding on Pseudo-Dionysius, others suggesting completely different classifications.

This game has far to go before release time. The good thing is that I imagine even if it comes out 2 years from now, it will still maintain novelty due to its physically based combat and dungeon crawler aesthetic.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if you find a relationship with a girl, it won't satisfy. Why don't you try something radically different? Give up all the bullshit of being in college and meandering through life and go in search of God. Pick a road and follow it. Just keep going. Don't stop till your experiences have given you such an appreciation for life that you can't but be thankful for what God has given you and even more thankful for His grace on a wretch like you, that He came down from his throne as a god and humbled himself to human form and to die for your spiritual disgust. You soon will find a realization that your physical attributes are nothing in the eternity found in your spirit and companionship with the Creator of All Things. Suicide is fucking lazy. It's cheap and requires no effort other than wallowing in the deception that Satan has cast upon you. Living is a true accomplishment. So why don't you go show up every random good looking bastard with a girl friend by living a life that is beyond the mundane and trance like. BE FREE! BE FREE! BE FREE! IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, BE FREE! </TEXT>

Xbox followed suit, but those greedy bastards still don't give ya much, shit like Assassin's creed brotherhood 5 yrs after it released.

<TEXT> Well, national guard  will most likely not see duty, but who knows. Just depends if you want to put yourself in a position where you may have to "neutralize" a target, or enemy, or random bystander they think has an IED, or seize an opium field or oil field completely unrelated to "fighting terrorism". I personally don't agree with the military, especially the marines, it places people in morally compromising positions that may or may not lead to horrendous sins, some of which cause some to question their humanity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do get frustrated that Christian folk in the US seem to worship Israel as a manifestation of the likeness of Jesus Himself. In reality, all throughout the Bible, God constantly condemns Israel for turning from God, allowing its enemies to rule over Israel when it is especially far from God. Obviously God never gives up on Israel, but allows them wallow in the free choice of sin like any other sinner. I see current times as no different, Israel, for the most part, does not hold the Christian Messiah as authoritative and certainly does not turn to God alone, given that the land is becoming more secular by the hour. Much like the united states.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is obvious that the United States shows an insurmountable amount of favoritism and biased to Israel. My question is why?

I know this subreddit can be full of memes and click-bait at times, so I want to take this opportunity now for anyone with legitimate knowledge and sources to please share with the rest of us. What are the direct links between the United States and the embarrassingly blatant influence Israel has on our politics, culture and military?

Who are the people? How is the money distributed? How did it get this way? And, where will it lead the US? 

I don't ask this to start argument, I earnestly ask this to be informed. Thank you in advance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was an example, and a commonly used form of demonic communication. I understand you perceive this as a cliche, but you must begin to see yourself as an eternal soul within the shell of your body. The beings you come in communication are ancient creatures, long since separated from their bodily temples, cast to float within the darkness. They have nothing more than eternal hatred flowing through their existence in hopes to separate you from the eternal God. They have nothing else. We humans are easily led astray. Do not be one of the many.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lucifer was the leader of worship within Heaven before he was cast out. He knows makes you tick. We humans are built to worship something, anything, whatever that idol may be. Also, your comparison is not fair, Ouija boards are an attempt to come in direct contact with spiritual entities. Heavy Metal music, pending the energy or theme within its message, is not an overt spiritual activity. Though it all begins with a seed sown. Do not be naive, friend.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can we speak about spiritual warfare? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-19 14:46:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Often as Christians, we speak of living a godly life but forget about that which exists around us at all times, the spiritual realm. The spiritual realm is the true realm to which all of us will exist within once we exit our bodies and are connected to the Father. Yet, we often go day to day, praying and speaking to God without realizing the true power of prayer and our authority that we are granted and protected by in the power and authority of our Savior, Yeshua, Jesus Christ. We have angels that follow us everywhere we go, who protect us from demonic onslaught and can be commanded in the name of Christ to intervene in godly manners and spiritual issues that are worthy of God's purpose. There are evil forces that will latch on to us, should we allow Sin to enter into our life willfully. The power of these angels are subdued and held back due to our willingness to Sin. This is God's desire to allow so, so that we shall be humbled to reliance on Him alone. We as human souls are also powerless within the spiritual realm without protection and guidance from the Lord. We shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven or survive the haze of the spiritual dark realms without our savior by our side. If you play with occult activities such as Ouija boards, you may perceive them as simply a game, yet you open portals for demons to enter your life and your bloodline. Do not mess with that which you are not meant to partake in. If you have fallen into this, turn from it, and pray in the authority of Christ to cast away and destroy this evil that has entered your life through portals and footholds. If you attempt to astral project, you will be deceived by the demons into believing you are in control and have power. But in fact, you will be a mere human swimming in a vast shark infested sea. You will be bound to being eaten alive. Without the mercy and support from our creator, our author of life, our lover of souls, we are doomed to fall into deep sin. Friends, be aware of all that exists around you, bound and determined to drag you away from the love that Christ graciously pours upon our weeping souls. His love abounds eternally, and simply requires a humbling of pride to enter into a kingdom that stands strong forever. Claim this love that Jesus has for you, claim this authority that Jesus shields you with. Our eyes do not perceive the apparent message of the spiritual realm as they once were intended to, yet, this realm exists and there is a war waging around you for your eternal soul. Stand firm on the Lord - know that He will never leave, abandon or turn from you. Call upon his name with trust and sincerity. The greatest spoils of this world are rotting, as we speak, in the face of the eternal God. Be well and turn your sorrowful eyes to the King of Kings, the LOVER OF YOUR SOUL.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sense your sarcasm and I know there's grey areas but there is clearly an overarching complacency towards the constant bombings and occupation of Middle Eastern people's homelands.

Winning a Hugo Award in 1968. "Harlan Ellison wrote 'I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream' in a single night in 1966, making virtually no changes from the first draft. He derived the story's title, as well as inspiration for this story, from a drawing by a friend, William Rotsler." What are your thoughts on this terrifyingly mysterious classic? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate mainstream reddit. I hate the hivemind and I hate how unbelievably predictable they all are. How is it possible that such a large majority of minds all center around one particular topic, such as supporting vaccinations and countless other mindless bullshit (such as their obsession with Neil De Gressie Tyson, "science" and Cats). Yet, there is an insane amount of confirmation, circlejerk bias that people on reddit are "intelligent". You would think, just statistically, that there would be a varied split on opinions of popular topics, yet when you scroll through a comments section, all differing opinions are downvoted to oblivion. 

Is there some sort of robot algorithm that upvotes all posts that fall within the calculated perspective necessary to be viewed on reddit or have we, as a culminated population, truly created a singular hivemind that is so indoctrinated to believe one particular side of an argument or perspective that the system just perpetuates itself forward. Is it a fear of being downvoted? Does anyone actually care about "karma" or another internet person's opinion on themself? 

If anyone could shine some light on this topic, you'd be more than welcome to speak your mind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see how crossfit could be generalized like this. The act of crossfit is a workout regimen involving power lifting, some olympic lifts, and organized circuit work outs. Usually each gym has a specific area for the crossfit members to workout, staying out of the way of stationary gym equipment.

Generalizing crossfitters to be douchebags based on this guy is about the same as generalizing all youtubers to be blatant retards because you watched PewDiePie. 

Or better yet, say that all redditors are part of the hivemind because they follow your dumbass comment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Short story audiobook can be viewed here - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WYqICycMxb0

Arthur C. Clarke has been noted on record stating "I am continually annoyed by careless references to 'The Sentinel' as 'the story on which 2001 is based'; it bears about as much relation to the movie as an acorn to the resultant full-grown oak. (Considerably less, in fact, because ideas from several other stories were also incorporated.) Even the elements that Stanley Kubrick and I did actually use were considerably modified. Thus the 'glittering, roughly pyramidal structure... set in the rock like a gigantic, many-faceted jewel' becameafter several modificationsthe famous black monolith. And the locale was moved from the Mare Crisium to the most spectacular of all lunar craters, Tychoeasily visible to the naked eye from Earth at Full Moon."

What are your thoughts towards the comparison? The stories themselves share a similar pillar, yet what do you find are their most contrasting differences? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was worried it would be a video of the actual "devouring". Glad it wasn't. Feel bad for the kid, but, based on piranha eating habits, the body was most likely previously deceased (maybe drowning?) and eaten post-mortem - as piranha, even within large groups, are primarily scavengers.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I met this really fantastic girl a while ago, we immediately hit it off, as she was boisterous, excitable and able to have a conversation without awkwardness or judgement. We're both Christians with a strong understanding of the message of Christ and both work in the same field, so we get to spend some time together pretty frequently. I felt immediately comfortable around her which is really nice. 

I've had people within the same circle of friends come up to me in conversation and borderline bug as to why we aren't dating and how she "screams 'my' girlfriend". 

The only issue is, I just don't feel the sensation you would when looking at someone physically beautiful, and I fear that makes me superficial. Is it wrong to have all other aspects of a christian relationship line up perfectly, but turn it down because the physical attraction is not? 

I've prayed about it for a while, and I would never want to get into something that I'm not at least all on board for, because I'd never want to end up hurting someone. I've read scripture that "beauty is fleeting and charm is deceptive, but a woman who fears the lord is to be held high", but maybe I'm not mature enough in my life right now to fully accept that. I don't know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't get in, which, as you've stated, is a possibility - don't give up on life. It may be a doorway to an unhindered sense of freedom you may have never known before if you didn't waste your entire life worrying about what your parents or other people thought about you. Think about all those bankers who TRIED SO HARD their entire lives, to get to the top, and find that there is nothing there for them except for the superficial numerical value next to their name. The second that plummets, they do as well off the 33rd story of their high rise apartment. The point is, fuck this stupid world and its expectations. You have a chance here to not give two shits for once and that is a weight that only the great have had lifted from their overburdened shoulders. Be free, my friend.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about time travel? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-14 15:23:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a little farfetched but I had an idea I wanted to share -

IF time travel were possible, could it be a possibility that the locations and time frames the individual is travelling to could actually be one of the infinite and varying parallel universes all coexisting within the same conscious reality? This is with the perspective that all time is is one moment, and all those one moments exist all on top of each other but in infinite characteristics, times and variations.

This is somewhat String Theory-esque but I wanted to hear some insightful opinions. Thank you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one will ever understand your difficulty in taking a human life. Being able to articulate the feeling with you, will prove even more difficult. Your commanding officer reaches his hand down, placing it on your shoulder. In your daze, you feel an understanding resonate through his touch. Transmitted through his neural fibers to your own is the momentary revelation that you required from another human. You stand to witness the presence of the man's mother fall and engulf your victims body in a protective hysterical shell. To see the judgement and sadness in her eyes would be the end of your soul. You turn and fall back into line. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand you emotions my friend. Some of your statements I'll chock up to poetry before God. You are trying so hard to be heard by others, loved, but also loved by God, many of the old testament writers shared your exact same pain, but within different context. I struggle with the desire to be accepted by woman, and it seems like a lot of guys experience acceptance on a regular basis, whether from their girl friend or various co-ed friends etc. But, at the end of the day, the only one that will fill the hole in your heart will be Jesus. Seek after him with all your heart. Join a bible study, a men's group, go evangelize and help people with your new found brethren and sisters, serving Christ as a community. God wants you to focus first on Him, because if he gives you a female, there's a possibility, in your passion, you may lose touch with your need for God and place her on a pedestal that will only collapse around. Let God be your strong and mighty foundation, brother! YOU ARE A MAN! A Man of God! A lover of souls and brokenhearted. You love them because you know the brokenness!   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-12-05 23:50:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've come to find that I'm far more passionate and, what I feel is, closer to God when I'm passionately singing a song that I truly enjoy. Hymnals and contemporary rock music just doesn't seem to raise my spirit like, what it seems for, others around me. It's gone as far as making me not look forward to church, as I know that I'm only going to be faking my way through the worship and praise portion and just end up feeling indifferent and bored by the time we reach the message/sermon portion. Does there really need to be a "set list" of praise songs that each worship band needs to know? Isn't that commercialization, if we're just singing 'Hillsong' every week? Similar to man-made traditions that God seems to disdain, in the bible, we in westernized Christianity, seem to be "religiously" following a set path each week when it comes to something as simple as worshiping God. It almost feels as if there is an insinuation that there are no other options aside from this routine and I feel we are overdue for some much needed deviations.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Traveling Planet [opening] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-04 08:04:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover. Some call it the thief, as it drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. When it does come, it's always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together in peace for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's Passing Eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and in others, the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the Sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. Some even believe the vibratory luminescence can evoke an inner potential. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime. 

 Sheol and I lay under the aquatic nightlight, overlooking our village  of which is celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights give illusion that the night's excitement is nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrates our sky. The blue bulb emanates such an energy, causing a sense of invigoration through its very presence . Away from all the festival cheer, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. Resting next to one another, hands grasped, I can feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

 "They say it's getting closer, you know, Sheol gently let out. In my hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

 "Uh... You don't buy into that collision course fear do you?" I rattle off in nearly the same words I've heard from my pop time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky. 

 "I don't know...My father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's different." Her gaze never breaks from the atmosphere, and I have no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The event. Silence fills the air as what she said begins to pass over me. 
 
 Fireworks can be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brings a smile to my face. We lay there quietly, looking directly at what some hold in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not overtaken me. I know I am exactly where I'm supposed to be. Sheol clasps my hand even tighter  her vision transfixed towards the endless blue; and all I can hear is that gentle hum.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically, its the age old internet argument that if you killed your grandfather, you would never be born. Therefore, he believes (most likely based on the Reddit hivemind Sagan-Degrasse Tyson indoctrination) that if Moses would have been killed, the Jews would never have been freed, Jesus would have never been born, christianity would have never developed, science would be praised, and we'd be on Mars right now with robots that would jerk us off on command. But, that's taking into consideration that there would be NO other religions to come into existence during that time (thus forwarding 'progress'), over analyzing that religion is a hindrance in the first place, and that humans could ever, or will ever progress to this hypothetical "stage II" society. 

End of the day. The kid most likely hated church growing up, felt some sort of enlightenment by browsing reddit, and now holds science to be the new god (that holds him to no social standard) of whom he puts his faith daily </TEXT>

To consider one perspective of the world wrong (a perspective that when examining the source material at its core, is used to promote love and selflessness) and consider another to be true without definitive answers, and to raise it up through anger, is outright hypocritical.  </TEXT>

Let me just skip ahead and let you know your Pun Thread is terrible, uncreative, and utterly bottom shelf humor. Seeing these threads is worse than seeing 'Cops' on G4tv.

<DATE> 2014-11-07 00:06:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Wanted to just make a list of sins that I've committed/am committing/will commit and secretly just need reassurance of my salvation. Honesty both ways here, thank you.

1.) Daily regularly user of pornography
2.) User of Tinder with the desire to meet somebody to have sex with
3.) Not a regular church goer and don't often consider holding the Sabbath as of high importance
4.) Often find fellowship with Christians to be disappointing and the Christians themselves to be boring/annoying
5.) Constantly searching for the best future for myself, serving myself.
6.) Drug and alcohol user, and often participate in social situations with the use of drugs and alcohol with non-believers. 

As I'm making this list, I don't mean to come off whiny or anything really. I just want those spiritually more sound than I to understand that my heart is willing, though I just generally suck and I'm not sure if my life will ever be that amazing transformation that you always hear about. If I continue in and out of these sins, will I be damned to eternal wrath? Will I ever be fully out of these sins? Can you pray for me? What do I need to do to be in right standing with God? Is there anything I can "DO"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think Angels can be forgiven. Because they were born into the perfect light and presence of God, knowing full well the consequences of their Sin. For humans, we are born into darkness and know not the sin we commit and its implications spiritually. Therefore, we go from darkness to light and the devil came from light to darkness.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've known Jesus as my savior for quite some time. I love what God has done for me, what God has taught me, and who God has turned me into. I was blessed to have made it through nursing school and am a male nurse at my local hospital with a steady job at a young age. There are no legitimate, outright issues or struggles within my life that are observable to the outside world. My only issue is, I feel that I have very little satisfaction with life. I spend 40+ hours a week at my job, with very little enjoyment. In my downtime between sleep, I spend at the gym working out, where I have very few social connections. On my days off, working nights, I usually waste the first day sleeping. The weeks are flying by and I feel as if though this life that Christ has given me is being wasted on the mundane and conventional. 

What is it that brings you, as a fellow Christian, satisfaction and fulfillment out of life?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: Why is Neil deGrasse Tyson such a reoccurring figure on Reddit? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-22 15:32:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are so many educated individuals to learn from throughout the entirety of the nation, with mountains of their media populating the internet. Why has this one particular character, Neil deGrasse Tyson become such a prominent figure throughout the Reddit consciousness? With so many articles and videos being posted to this website on a second by second basis, how does one particular niche professor maintain a presence on the front page of multiple subreddits on a relatively consistent basis? Is there an underlying hive mind that regulates the postings within reddit, that if not adhered to are buried in downvotes? Doesn't this frequent perspective from a single source, although intelligent, generate a recycled confirmation biased among the user base? What is it about this character that draws such a fancy from some many Redditors? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Themes of the game aside, it's still a game. When I play max payne or gta, it is just fun to kill people. To play a shooter of any sort and enjoy it, only to knock another shooter for its themes is outright hypocritical. Just because this game "appears" to be deriving meaning or purpose from senseless violence, does not mean that the character couldn't have multiple layers. No matter the outcome, this argument has long been played out on the mainstream media thousands of times and really isn't worth running in circles over. Mental illness or taking violent action is a choice and studies have clearly shown that an artistic form of game media will not abruptly perpetuate those murderous actions. If the game is fun, let it be fun. If it crosses a few boundaries, let it do so with pride. Just don't let your kids play it and we'll all be fine ;)     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I apologize ahead of time for being so ignorant. 

I only watch the news in passing at work, and all I can say is, I'm so fed up with the lies and scare tactic propaganda that I feel almost all news outlets are force feeding down the American public's throats.

Am I wrong to say that men in black garbs and turbans with AK47s shown marching on television seems to be the biggest load of horseshit I have ever seen generated in the mainstream media narrative thus far? For the longest time, I was waiting for another 9/11 false flag to happen, enabling our military free reign to invade the remaining middle eastern countries such as Syria - and then a more prepared nation, distrusting of official stories would begin to stand against our misleading government. But now, there comes the story of journalists getting beheaded, and stories of "terrorists" murdering their own people, and that's all that's required for the U.S. to begin airstrikes on "select" Syrian targets? And not a god damn peep from the general public? And this all happens right around the 9/11 anniversary, when public "emotion" is at its highest. I just can't keep the story straight anymore. It's just all so ambiguous and makes no sense.

I also disdain the fact that our public still believes in fairy tales of good and evil, as if there exist no grey areas, and the ones WE bomb are the ones who deserve it. It's just so disheartening to know that I am part of  such a violent and uneducated public who still calls themselves Christian yet pulls the trigger everyday; and a government that would rather spew lies directly to our faces than ever considering standing up against big corporate business interests in foreign countries. 

It's almost like I'm living in a dream anymore. A dream where there is no hope for the people, and all there is to expect from life is small culminations of human hate and greed. How did it come to this? 

Please help me make sense of all this. All opinions are welcome. I just don't know who to trust anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The validity of the text is essentially nullified based on the fact that the article itself states that the text was possibly authored 800 years after Christ's life on Earth. That's like me writing a document stating that Jesus had laser vision and someone digging it up in the year 3200 AD, calling it valid strictly based on the fact its now a document of antiquity. Can we seriously think for ourselves people? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watch [Zeitgeist debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFI6m6Icav4) , a lot of what you're stating is fabricated to fit the agenda of the Zeitgeist creator. Also, to say Jesus didn't exist, even as a historical figure is outrageous. And stating, "those who 'came to arrest him' could never find him because he didn't virtually exist" is a logical fallacy because you're pulling accounts from the Gospel source material to refute the source material. It makes no sense.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you've made it thus far, you're probably curious what happened to the rest of the puppies. Yup, dead. All dead. Eaten by Guildabeasts. Yeah, I know sad right? Should have listened to blazetheraze and stopped reading. What's a Guildabeast, you ask? It's a big gay guy with a tiny dick and hooves for feet used to carry out painful erotica bullshit. Yeah, I know, fucked up right? Should of just stopped reading like blazetheraze told you. But since you've made it this far, you should be aware that the Jews did 9/11 and you're retarded if you don't even question the official 9/11 commission. And by retarded, I mean you're a fearful bastard who probably will flag this comment, strictly on the basis that its "Stepped over its bounds" and will offend poor little grandma. Well, you know what? Fuck grandma. She was a dumb Slut just like mom. She got pregnant and fucked up her dreams before she was 20, but I suppose that was more "commendable" back then, huh? Well, sorry to break it to ya, but having kids, growing old and dying is a waste of life. You haven't even figured out your own self and now you wanna bring another life into this world so you can vicariously live through them and impart all your insecurities into their innocent heart? Also, make sure they go to college and get an "education". Because we all know 50k in student loans is the best way to teach someone that committing suicide would be a lot easier than this bullshit. So, the cycle repeats. What fun? Well, thanks for joining me and remember to stick your head in the sand when any real truth is placed in front of you. :)


tl;dr -  You should have listened to blazetheraze and just stopped reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Decent. Just working away at my job, of which I'm very blessed to have in this economy. Interestingly enough, the date I talked about didn't really pan out but led to meeting someone else who also loves Christ and seems to have a lot of interest in me. My only issue, and I believe it to be a superficial one includes that, though we get along fantastic, I don't feel very attracted to her physically and I don't know how important that is. There's also the fact of the matter of, why should I worry about a relationship at all? I am still currently back and forth with the sin of internet pornography which drives me crazy, so how could I be ready for a relationship? One good thing is, a friend of mine from work, has asked me to take him to Church recently, so we have been going. Prayer for him would be fantastic. His name is Charles. Other than that, I think I've come up with a tentative goal of moving to Hawaii in the next 5 years. Something about it seems to call me out there. But anyway, thank you for following up with me :D. I pray that you're doing well? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Great buzzword. The embarrassing part is your use of the phrase "anti-Semite" is far too commonly misused and implies racism through its usage. Unfortunately for you, this video is not discriminatory towards any particular group or sect of people - neither is the title. It simply demonstrates a dialogue between the President of Israel (Netanyahu) and his acquaintances, as He discusses his intentions corresponding to Palestinian relations. Through his actions during his presidency, and most predominantly during the past month, it is the leader of the Jewish state, Israel, that demonstrates a lack of tolerance towards a specific ethnic group (Palestinians) - and thus can be dubbed "Racist".

<TEXT> The definition of enlightenment can extend two directions. Your direction that you propose incorporates scientific progression and healthcare/augmentational advances. The other direction proposes that becoming enlightened involves understanding our inner-self, accepting that death is inevitable and living in peace through that knowledge. I do not foresee that the human race will be around for the many eons to come. There is also the consideration of whether or not the Creator will even allow this Universe to extend its existence longer than initially intended. Our existence is finite. But there is an infinite existence that we feel exists, and should strive to find, beyond our Earthly shell. This I feel is achievable through the understanding of Jesus Christ.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this is an over asked question, but I really need some input. Working 40 hrs a week and raising a family to repeat the cycle can't possibly be what God intends us for. I feel as if though I'm driven mad by the mindless pursuits the majority of the population seem to strive for. What are things that we, as Christians, should participate in to find true satisfaction in life? Even success feels like a failure here on Earth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You just need the title to compliment the cover art. If not compliment, make sure it doesn't clash with the cover art, which I feel it is doing now. Especially the blue and red. Take a look at other cover art text, they usually match the aesthetic and have a style of their very own. At the very least, the text should be so minimalistic  and out of the way that people will find the album title once they've been pleased by the cover art. This cover has much potential and can't afford to be brought down by poor text.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my hard drive on my computer died and I went to an old friend to help fix it. I got to meet his girl friend there and she thought I was so nice that I should meet her friend. I didn't think much of it because usually in those situations, I'm not attracted to the person they try to hook me up with. But this time was different and the girl is very pretty. We finally organized a double date activity together and I was nervous leading up to it because I didn't hear much back from my buddy and I felt almost out of the loop. But he's a dude, and doesn't really care too much about these things, I've come to learn lol. The interesting thing was that his girl friend actually took my number from his phone and contacted me to confirm our plans and stated how excited her and her friend were for dinner etc. I mentioned hiking and ice cream and the girl friend said that "might be better for the second date ;)". That boosted my confidence, as it seemed to demonstrate to me a reciprocated sense of anxiety and excitement prior to getting together, as well as preconceived future plans as a possibility. (I over think things, I know) We did dinner, and I met her. She was very pretty and very quiet, but very kind. I didn't mind the quiet, because I figured we would get to know each other in a more personal situation soon enough anyway. I got her number and she seemed interested in getting together soon. The only issue is that we work different schedules. But we both work at the hospital. I work third shift, she usually works second. And where she works there is no reception for texts etc. My real question, which is probably just me being a nervous nelly, arises from that fact that I texted her the next day about getting together soon and it took her over 24 hours to respond. The eventual response was appropriate and demonstrated interest, but I suppose I just need patience I guess. I'm just so used to people responding immediately, or at least within the same day. I just find it odd that her responses take so long to send and are so generically objective. It's almost like she's never texted before (at least for a girl, as most girls are very expressive and long winded in text form). Her length of time of response and responses are like interacting with a grand parent who just got text and only give you the exact answer you need for the moment. But, as of now, there's mention of getting together in a week when her schedules freed up to get a drink. Which is promising, but I just want to get things going asap. I know that's not a good quality to have, being anxious and wanting it all now (of which I don't show in public) but you'd think if someone was mutually interested in the other party, they too would want to interact as much as possible in the early stages. I suppose all I can do is chill the 'ef out and be patient. I'm just nervous because I desire a relationship to a large extent and want it immediately. But I can't force anything I suppose. The anticipation is just killing me. Any thoughts? Thanks :) Hope I don't come off as a winy biatch.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Job 2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
6 And the devil said to Him, "I will give You all this domain and it glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 
7 "Therefore if You worship[4][Or bow down before ] before me, it shall all be Yours." 
8 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'

Luke 10:18 And He [Jesus] said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

Jude 1:9 But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"

There's many other passages that have the character of Satan or Lucifer or The Serpant/ Dragon as being more than just allegorical. The Bible directly describes the Sins that arise against on this earth stem from our internal desires and evil, the worlds temptations and Satan's schemes. These entities are all seperate from one another.

<TITLE> Something cool happened last night </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-23 12:56:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So last night it was planned by coworkers to go out for a birthday and get thoroughly drunk, as is common practice. 

Leading up to last night, I was feeling all these convictions that I needed to get away from that and just tell them I couldn't go. But I of course was afraid of their judgement of me, since I see them more than 40 hrs a week.

In the morning I was invited to a campus Christian ministry gathering and started to really feel convicted at that point to not participate in the later part of the day's activities.

I end up going out and we had all been drinking for about 4 hours at this point and randomly at the one bar, I run into an old Chrisitan friend. We immediately discuss things about Jesus and he begins telling me all about the low points he had been going through since I last saw him. Depression, guilt and thoughts of suicide. He had since gotten back on track but as we kept talking I felt more and more convicted to just leave the bar and my coworkers and just pray. 

So we end up going outside and praying for one another and now I'm
Going to attend his church this morning.

As I was driving home, I saw a guy hailing my car like a taxi and I picked him up, cuz what else better do I have to do at this point. 

We end up talking and I come to find out that he too had been struggling very hard with alcohol and we started to talk about Jesus. He explained to me about how far he had strayed away from his faith and how everything we were discussing came at the perfect timing of God, as he had no other explanation as to how we came together so specifically at this time at this place.

We prayed together and he and myself were so strengthen by Jesus that night. My coworkers may hate me for just leaving them, but that conviction to leave on whim had led me to someone God needed to build up that night (myself included). They may not understand me and may even shoot me down, but Jesus understands and I couldn't be more thankful to participate in the work God has provided. </TEXT>

<TEXT> War is never good. Ever. Only to defend one's self. Our current occupation of Middle Eastern countries to combat "Terrorism" is a myth and strictly based on Corporate Imperial Consumerism.

We as a country need to take a stand now to ensure that our leaders in Washington never lead us into the horrors of War again. As for what we are involved in currently, we must bring an end to it.

Far too many of our young men and women are being destroyed physically and emotionally due to the exact same circumstances that your grandfather and all the men in this picture have experienced. We must take a stand.

<TEXT> Because they're referring to the different sects and that is what Catholicism is, a different sect. Though for some reason, of all the seperate sects, Catholicism is the only one that would most likely correct someone that they're Catholic if called Christian. I personally feel there shouldn't be this amount of differation, it creates segregation and superiority complexes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> haha I actually had to check the context of what I said to see if I came off gay lol. But no, I am not gay. My opinion is just, Jesus said "Don't cast your pearls to swine". As in, your most precious treasure lies in the truth that we find in the salvation of Jesus Christ (His life, sacrifice, and resurrection). All you can do is live that life style and present that truth to people, nothing more. If they deny you, you do what Jesus instructed us to do, "Wipe off the dirt and move on". We can't force the message of the Gospel down someone's throat if they have no desire to hear it. So when I hear a Christian say that our country or world has a homosexuality "issue", all I can do is giggle. Our entire world is cursed with Sin - none bigger or smaller in God's eyes. So for us to label something as a particular "issue", insinuating that it is something that can be eradicated through our own doing, would be rather insulting to God, don't you think? It's like stating that a certain cup filled with poison is more dangerous to drink than another particular cup holding the same type of poison. The size and shape may vary but the only difference is that some drink from one cup and someone else, another cup. We all drink the same poison and it all leads to death.  What I'm eluding to is that, we can't pick and choose Sins as greater, and more detrimental to Christianity as a whole. The only way to lead others to LOVE, is to demonstrate love through our actions. Christ showed this through his life. He interacted with all sinners, acknowledging that all have equally fallen from the righteous that God demands. We must follow this example and love all those outside of Christ's forgiveness equally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Romans 8:31-39
New Living Translation (NLT)
Nothing Can Separate Us from Gods Love

31 What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? 32 Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, wont he also give us everything else? 33 Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No onefor God himself has given us right standing with himself. 34 Who then will condemn us? No onefor Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at Gods right hand, pleading for us.

35 Can anything ever separate us from Christs love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? 36 (As the Scriptures say, For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.[a]) 37 No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.

38 And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from Gods love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[b] neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrownot even the powers of hell can separate us from Gods love. 39 No power in the sky above or in the earth belowindeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but I think he's referring to wrongful condemnation. When you condemn someone for something that is just generally silly to be condemning for and not edifying to the person or God or leading that person to God.

I think it's okay to condemn the wrongful condemners because in reality, you are just trying to spread the truth as you perceive in the light of Christ's teachings.

 He is attempting to disclose that the condemnation that he sees others bringing upon others is not "in love" - when Jesus did and told us to do everything in love.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just saying, our existence, spiritual, fleshly or otherwise operate along the same patterns and laws as was originally breathed into being. As time has progressed, different vocabulary and interpretations have been generated to explain similar operations. There can only ever be one truth, but the Fallen Ones only purpose until judgement day is to lead mankind in the direction of deception. The theory of aliens, though feasible within an evolutionary view point, does not seem to correlate with the Biblical scripture that we hold as The Creator's Word. The incidences in which "extraterrestrial" and "extra-dimensional" entities have been experienced tend to share many qualities with that of conjuration and demonic activity: The use of channeling, sexual abuse and penetration, as well as modes in which they traverse (in and out of the space-time continuum or otherwise). I am only presenting these things to you that you not fall into confusion should you be alive when this day comes. Keep your eyes to the Heavens and be prepared for the return of our Lord, Jesus Christ - today and tomorrow.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So like, before humans, God created Angels. They were his servants and Lucifer was born the greatest of all. He was born perfect, given consciousness directly in the presence of perfection and radiant light (God). Over time, Lucifer became jealous of God receiving all the glory and, being so powerful, deceived himself that he too could be Lord over all - Higher than God. Which is just logically an impossibility. That's like a a character in a story believing they could be greater than the person that wrote them into existence. Anyway, having once deceived himself, Lucifer convinced 1/3 of God's Angels to join his army and rebel against God. God then cast the Angel's out of his highest chambers of Heaven, banishing them. After this, at some point in space and time, God created humans. Satan then proceeded to deceive humans into disobeying God, making them believe God was trying to hold them back from becoming "like God" if they obtained the knowledge of good and evil. This is called Sin - disobeying God. Ever since the *fall of man*, and progressively throughout history, the fallen angels and demonic forces have existed within and out of our realm (spiritually), affecting us directly and indirectly. Whether that be through temptation or various other methods such as possession, demons have had a negative effect on our world. Fortunately, through the power of prayer, we have been given authority through the Holy Spirit of God and the authoritative name of Jesus to command these spirits to have no power over others and ourselves. This is all due to the faith that we have in God through Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for our Sins. This brings terrible anguish to Lucifer (Satan), as he knows his fate has long since been sealed and doesn't want anyone to know the power that can found through the love of Yeshua (Jesus).

Ps - it's just so freeing to humble oneself before God and embrace the forgiveness that Jesus offers. Once someone accepts that love and knows their name is written in the book of Life for eternity, God will shape you into the Christ-like individual He originally intended you to be. Salvation happens in a moment, Sanctification occurs over a life time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> His *Seven Swans* album is definitely the most Biblically inspired, but his music is so varied I wouldn't say it falls under the category of Christian. Rather, he is a Christian who makes beautiful music and, at times, pulls those themes into his lyrics. *Illinois* is for sure his most popular album but I consider them all very enjoyable. 

also, rel4ted to prayer - There is authority over  the spiritual forces in the name of Jesus, Yeshua. As in, authority over all spiritual beings has been given to him by the will of God (the author of all life). "12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." So, when you pray, pray that the spiritual forces that are not of Christ be bound and cast away *in the name of Jesus - Amen* (Truth) - There's a lot of supernatural things going on in our natural perspective that we don't even realize. Thankfully, we have our Lord to guide us through.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People are deceived, people think religion belongs in what our United States has turned politics into. It's all for show and the show has created a culture where if you affiliate with A religion, you should stand by B candidate. That's an idiotic and closed off mindset. Most likely, those politicians care more about their deep pockets than pleasing Christ. And the elections are blatantly rigged. There were scores of people supporting Ron Paul, but the establishment would not allow it. The media is owned. It IS propaganda. The world is ran by Satan and his human puppets. All we can do is look to Christ for freedom in the afterlife and present people with the truth of his gospel today.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prayer is just demonstrating that you wish to communicate with the one who created you. Also, you pray, God moves. You pray and Angels are sent by the scores to lovingly attend to you or others. There is much power in prayer. An unseen spiritual power that begins with aligning our will with Christ through love and humility.

<TEXT> Romans 2:  12-16

This might shed some perspective. But I suppose this is still up to interpretation. 

12 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in Gods sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) 16 This will take place on the day when God judges peoples secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work night shift, don't sleep much, workout quite a bit, and have been sick lately. I just found out I have Shingles ( a reemergence of the chicken pox virus when your body's immune system is compromised). Please pray that this will pass, i'm currently taking anti virals). i'm 23 and I've found out that if you get shingles before the age of 50, you have a 74% chance of having a stroke in your life. So that's got me worried as well.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a Christian and every day I would go to bed full of guilty related to PMO. It would even convince myself at times that I wasn't saved and that Christ's sacrifice wasn't sufficient. I knew this was a lie and I also knew the satisfaction I thought I could find in PMO was a lie as well - yet I bought into it like a slave to my body. God has blessed me with another day away from guilt and, praise Jesus, it feels good. It feels good to look to God without a contrived blemish looming over my soul. There are many other sin's that I am also dealing with in my life, as well, but Lord it is uplifting to be free of this one. God bless all for freedom from sin. Sanctification. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen CG trailers for games such as Diablo 3 and they look [Beautiful](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpLVYHOkvM). I've begun to ask myself, with the over saturation of Pixar copycats flooding the limelight (aimed primarily at children), why haven't there been more full length animated feature films that are of higher quality, such as [Final Fantasy: Spirits Within](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaI7ZPA9I1c)? With such a large market of teens and young adults who watch Japanese Anime, why haven't there been more attempts by Western culture to tap into this mature audience? </TEXT>

There also may be marijuana of which I will partake as well. I'm telling you all this because I really do believe in the Salvation of Jesus but I feel that I often times am on highs and lows, times where I am obedient and times where I openly disobey God. Please don't attack, but help me understand. Am I not saved? Being up and down like this? I just don't know what to say really.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, GTA V's audience is far more expansive than CoD's. They might have been able to do a fraction of GTA's sales if they didn't pump out copypastas every year. Rockstar actually cares about their audience. Hence why they've never had an article written on them about trying to break sales records. That should come in hindsight if you really care about your audience.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would anyone prefer better Crashes in Racing games than better Graphics? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-03 14:20:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel that every iteration of whatever racing series (Forza Motorsport, Gran Turismo etc.) all demo the amazing amount of detail put into the car models, yet they completely neglect some of the most fun parts of racing games - crashes. 

You have games such as Burnout that focus on that part of racing, yet it is on a grand end of the spectrum of racing games and takes a common part of cars and places it to the highest level. As entertaining as it is, it would be enjoyable to see what other game developers are capable of in the realm of car crashes and overall vehicle physics.

You have independent games such as [Beam NG](http://www.beamng.com/content/) that are experimenting with the limits of car destruction simulation and real time automobile malleability, which is exciting, novel and fresh. The only thing that comes as a shock is why more racing game developers haven't researched technology such as this and brought racing simulation to new level beyond current damage models. In some ways, when I play a racing game without realistic crashes, it's like playing a football game without tackles.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I pray, I believe, I forgive, I read my Bible. I don't always go to church. I work full time as a nurse at a hospital. I work second shift and spend most of my time either sleeping, working, and free time late at night. My nights after work usually involve being with friends, or playing video games at home. I still struggle with pornography and various other daily sins that sometimes I do commit, and sometimes don't commit. I ask forgiveness and attempt to move forward. I just don't really know what I'm doing with my life anymore, because it seems like now that I'm working, time is flying by so fast. I feel like I've accomplished nothing for the Kingdom of Christ, other than trying to represent Him the best I can at work, I suppose. I don't get to see the body of Christ very often, and lately I've just been wondering if I am even fully following Christ. I just don't really know what to say or do anymore... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know this is probably posted a million times but I could use some prayers. I struggle with pornography and I just don't understand how to completely overcome it. There will be periods of time where I'll go on without doing it and I'll convince myself that it is gone forever, then temptation comes at me even harder, and I fall. I pray. I meditate. I even attempted to deliver myself from an unclean spirit that I thought may be hindering me (of which I'm still uncertain) and I can only ever last for maybe 2 weeks at the maximum. I want to overcome this because I want to show God that I'm ready for a serious relationship with him and possibly a wife, if he'll permit it. But I feel so held back. I feel accused by it, and then I feel weak. I turn to Jesus and know that  I am redeemed but I always feel like I'm such a let down to Jesus. I very much want to cleanse myself of this so that I can show God I'm ready and mature. But I suppose all I can ask for is prayers.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do you ask a Christian girl out? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-04 08:46:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a very general, basic question...answer individually as you deem true.

But, I'll give you a specific example of my life...I am a new nurse at my local hospital and there is a particular female that I have began to find very attractive. Her outer beauty of course. But her personality is just so boisterous and exuberant. She is just a fantastic joy to listen to and a very positive energy. And I think what created the greatest attraction was when she would openly talk about Jesus in such a confident manor amidst fellow employees. The only unfortunate part is that, though our interactions have been positive and a possible chemistry is there, I feel that our jobs are so busy. We hardly have time to truly create a foundational friendship. This leaves me in a very silly situation. Logic tells me, don't be moronic and rushingly ask her out before you really know her and end up looking like a fool. But instinct tells me, if I wait too long and don't establish some sort of relationship, I will miss my chance and regret it. I'm not sure what to say really, because I know my issue is really a generally mild topic. I'm just at a strange point in my life where I have begun my career and it takes up a majority of my time, and I feel that my primary time to mingle will be in my work environment and I truly would enjoy having someone to share my life with. I know I'm probably wayyyy over thinking it, but I have no idea how to approach this situation, or if I should even give it a second thought. An odd duality of all or nothing. Maybe you can Pray that God give me a clear mind? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Bible tells us that there's a constant war going on around us. A war that involves the spiritual heavenly hosts and principalities of darkness. I personally feel that this says so much in regards to the Christian faith. I feel that this says so much more than just going to church every Sunday and putting on a smile for our white suburban brothers at a midweek bible study. The bible is essentially saying there are beings that have existed, spiritually, in our world, or realm, for an uncounted number of lifetimes. The beings have seen nation rise and nation fall. These beings are the ultimate researchers on the human condition and can predict what you're going to do before you even decide that you will do it. Some of these creations have even sat at the foot of God's throne.
I suppose where my issue is, is in my own life. I, like many Christians, battle against Sin and the world daily. I pray. I read the Bible. I try to represent Christ the best I can. I fail many times. I know there is much more going on in our world than just what we see with our eyes and speak with our mouths. But at times, I wonder if I will ever truly understand or partake in this supernatural battle that rages on. I'm a nurse at a hospital who helps people daily, sure, but its still just a job at times. I then proceed home and fiddle on my computer and maybe be with friends. It's a relatively monotonous life, that has been replicated one billion times over in many other countries and timelines. 

I guess my biggest question is: Can I expect to experience God on a supernatural level, the kind that changes lives, or is my meandering lifestyle going to hold me back from truly seeing what I know is out there until the day my soul leaves body? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is the book of Enoch unused in modern scripture? (Though referenced multiple times by texts commonly accepted as biblical canon) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-07 22:40:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It truly is a fascinating piece of literature that fits within Biblical canon and timeline. It covers interesting topics such as End Times, detail on Fallen Angels interbreeding with human woman - creating giants (Nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6:4 and in Daniel, of whom were a primary cause of God's Flood) - and also covering "The Just One", commonly perceived as Christ. Below are also some references towards Enoch in the Bible. 

**Hebrews 11:5** - 5 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.

**Genesis 4:17-18** - 17 Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.

**Genesis 5:18-19** - 18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch. 19 After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.

**Genesis 5:21-24** - 21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. 22 After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 23 Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 24 Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.

**1 Chronicles 1:3** - 3 Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah.

**Luke 3:37** - 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,

the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel,

the son of Kenan,

<DATE> 2013-05-19 05:16:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I ask this because, the majority of the time we come across something related to secret societies, such as the Illuminati, they are presented as a "Satanic" group and oppose the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Since the majority of the users in here are in opposition to this group, can I ask if your beliefs align with the Christian Theology?

Edit: Interesting that there is a lot of anti "religion" perspectives. Understandable. But when you examine the four Gospels and the example Jesus set within that narrative, some will note that Jesus too was against meaningless religion. He despised the Pharisees that had manipulated Judaism at that time for their own personal gain. It appears that what Jesus really came to do was demonstrate and create a way for individuals to be in direct communion with God. Jesus was liberating the people from religion and leading them to relationship and faith. When examining the source documents of the accounts with Jesus, one can immediately identify a paradoxical teaching that is prevalent between what Jesus said and what some modern religious establishments teach. In a way, The Illuminati, or Satan, would actually support the binding and legalism that some current "Christian" groups hold over there followers. While Satan has infiltrated religion, he fears the masses beginning to understand the relationship that can be had with God through Jesus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have accepted Christ as my Lord and savior many years ago, but as many do, I have some questions. Lately, when I spend way too much time on Youtube, I get a really mixed message on Salvation. 

I watch these [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYINqTN1SBw) that tend to make me feel as if though I still am condemned, even after years of walking with Christ. I obviously haven't been perfect, and it's a daily struggle. But I just need some clarification on the life that Jesus excepts from me. When I watch these videos, it often times makes me terrified that I'm not doing enough. 

I've always been taught that Grace trumps the Law, but lately I'm feeling very condemned by the message of Law that's being presented. 

My life consists of working at a retirement home and daily reading my scriptures and praying. I still struggle with various sins and I just don't know what to think anymore. I am constantly bombarded with the message that I haven't done enough but also the message that only through Christ's sacrifice are we sufficient before God. When I come across opportunities to talk to people about Jesus, I do. Should I be doing more? Should I leave the working world? I feel condemned and I just need truth and encouragement.

TL;DR - I'm getting mixed messages </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm surprised more games don't use the awesome [Euphoria Animation System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6F3lT1v79I) that can be seen in games like Max Payne 3 and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. With the repetition that comes with seeing the same death animations in games like Call of Duty through the use of Motion Capture, you would think that more development studios would utilize the novelty and variety of Euphoria Animation. It's one of the primary reasons I always looked forward to most of the recent iterations in the Rockstar franchise. The level of visceral movement that is procedurally generated from the Euphoria engine leaves me wanting more after every experience and I would love to see how it will shape this generation and next generation games' animation development. Thoughts?

The level of visceral movement that is procedurally generated from the Euphoria engine leaves me wanting more after every experience and I would love to see how it will shape this generation and next generation games' animation development. Thoughts?

<TEXT> The Year: 2064

 

Grandpa walks into the living room to see his 6 year old grandson is laughing, laying prone in front of some sort of handheld gaming device while his

eyes are in REM. (Rapid Eye Movement)

 

"Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion

 

 

Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)

 

 

Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a

Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"

 

 

"Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.

 

 

"Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.

 

 

"We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices.

The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse

divided in half with central a flat surface.

 

Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"

 

 

Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"

 

 

"Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"

 

 

"Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device,

at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.

 

 

"Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.

 

 

"It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.

 

 

As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age,

I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly,

within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around

in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with

metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent

as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa

to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.

 

 

"Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.

 

 

Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures

the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson

with cheer.

 

 

"Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.

 

 

"We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.

 

 

"What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.

 

 

"Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt.

 

 

"OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.

 

"Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be

seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.

 Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog.

Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain

gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery.

 

Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his

right leg and a grab

at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.

 

"Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction,

all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state.

This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from

whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing.

A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling.

Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face

to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough

to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader.

On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.

 

"God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.

 

The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!".

A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery

with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.

 

"Fuckin' pull him over here!" Demands the medic. With slight hesitation, grandpa begins to drag the hemorrhaging soldier closer to cover and the medic. As he lets go, the medic screams for

grandpa to, "Hold pressure on it!". As grandpa places his hands in a viscous pool of blood, his clothes and face are quickly covered in red spurts and drops with each diminishing amount of

circulation. A sudden cut back to the living room shows a paralleled horror on grandpa's face.

 

"Stay with me!" screams the medic as he scrambles through his pack for more gauze pads. The nameless soldier is looking directly in to the eyes of Grandpa as the soldier takes his last

liquid filled breaths and his eyes leave focus past grandpa and into the distance. The pressure from the open vessel that grandpa is rigorously holding begins to halt completely and the soldier's eyes slowly fade shut.

Covered in blood and earth, grandpa stares deeply in astonishment at the man that is lifeless in his arms. Grandpa hears no sound around him.

 

 

"Whatchya doin' gwandpa???", abruptly questions grandson of which pulls grandpa from his haze in disbelief that his grandson was standing before him, let alone smiling. The assault rifle almost larger than he was.

"We gotta' take the compownd, gwandpa. Hurwy up!" Grandson grabs grandpa's hand and pulls him up off his knees and they begin to race in the direction that all the other soldiers are heading.

In the distance, the flashes from the machine guns can be seen quickly approaching. As they came closer, the number of bodies increased as well as the number falling soldiers all around them.

Grandpa sees a large trench system approaching, and grandson jumping into it. In fear for his grandson's life, he races into the trench. He follows his grandson's lead and keeps his head down.

They are now progressing through a large labyrinthine trench and begin to follow a small group of about eight allied soldiers. The gun fire and explosions are constant and it is nearly suicide to lift

attempt a view outside of what was becoming a mass grave. The dust was not as nearly as dense within the trench system and soldiers could be seen attempting to enter the trench only to be laced with crossfire. The artillery fire

was creating large amounts of debris and, at times, human extremities to soar through the air.  

 

 

"They're fuckin' killin' us out there! We need to take that compound!" Exclaims the drop ship Sergent, as he slides to meet his team within the trench.

 

 

Grandpa's heart is in a constant state of continuous adrenaline and his pupils are fixed on following his grandson and the other soldiers in any direction they choose to progress.

 

"Don't worwy gwandpa, I know where I'm gowing. I beat this pwart yestawday", reassures grandson. Grandpa continues to follow in complete amazement and horror.

They suddenly approach within 25 meters, the flank of a larger artillery gun and anti-air guns that combined blasts create vibrations so dense that, with each explosive blast, the ground is shaken to its core and human

ears enter into utter shell shock ringing and tinnitus. Grandson abruptly throws up  his fist, giving the command to halt. Grandpa stares in focus and silence as he sees the enemy is completely unaware, garbed in

ghillie suit uniforms that match the gray and tanned tones of this alien world. Grandson motions for half of the assembled team to approach the artillery nest from a branching trench path, creating an alternative

angle of attack.

 

Without hesitation, grandson turns around to grandpa and says, "You eva shwot one-a deez?", revealing a missile launcher and tossing it at grandpa who nearly stumbles upon catching it. Grandpa stares in bewilderment.

"It's swimple, just aim and shwoot." Giggles grandson as he motions the remaining men to ready their rifles. "On my cwommand", says grandson. Grandpa quickly shakes himself out of his emotional paralysis and readys the launcher on

his shoulder, looking down the display system. Which aumatically targets the largest artillery canon, stating "FIR RDY". The artillery team continues their foundation shattering battery and the team of soldiers lead by

grandson have their rifles aimed at the ready directly towards the enemy nest and grandpa is sitting shaking with a rocket launcher reluctantly pointed at an unknown adversary. Time comes to a near crawl and the beads of sweat

roll down grandpa's jittering face....

 

"COVERWING FIYA!!!" Commands grandson with all the air in his little lungs as he and the rest of the team light up the air with assault rifle rounds into the naive opposing forces. At that moment, grandpa, reflexively pulls the launching

trigger and a missile expels a huge back draft that pushes the dust around the trench out in all directions and in the blink of an eye the projectile burst forward and then 100 ft straight into the air. The recoil cascades

grandpa onto his back. All he can see is nameless soldiers unloading clips in a congruent direction and his grandson laughing as he hip fires his gun using a shoulder strap. Without warning, like a comet, the projectile hurdles

directly downward and a bright flash of blinding white light and silence is all that can be sensed. Everyone takes cover and awaits visual clarity. Of which is obtained after a large gust of particles are pushed past the entire squad

through the cravas of the trench. All that remains is a massive thick smoke cloud, forming out of a crater in the ground where the artillery nest was previously located. As grandpa began to gain his bearring, white ash began to settle

over them like snow.

 

"Nice shwot, gwandpa!" exclaims grandson as all the soldiers cry out in victory. Amongst the shear epicness of the entire situation, grandpa manages to release a small smirk on his mug as the chills of success reverberate throughout his spine.

 Grandpa looks at his grandson, as he begins to climb to the edge of the trench and stand before his fellow soldiers. "We have twaken down deir defwenses. Now we must bwing down their stwonghold! Fowwow me to Victorweee!!!"

Grandson cries as he lifts his guns over his head with both arms. Every soldier, including grandpa cannot help but roar with courage.

 

*CRACK*

 

Is all that is heard. Grandson stumbles at his perch, and places his hand on his chest revealing crimson painting his fingers.

 

"Noooooo!!" Screams grandpa as he rushes to bottom of the trench and catches his grandson as he falls. All is silent as every soldier stares onward at grandpa holding his fatally wounded grandson in his embracing arms. Tears glisten down his face,

unable to vocalize his grief past his disbelief.

 

"Gwandpa", whispers grandson in grandpa's ear.

 

"Yes", quickly relishes grandpa - at his kin's every word.

 

 

"GAME OVERRRRRRRRRRR", interrupts an ominous and robotic voice heard over top all the game world. At which the entire environment begins to suddenly breakdown around grandpa and he and grandson are rapidly whisked back to the their living room.

 

Grandpa looks onward in a stupor, completely motionless for several seconds when grandson interrupts, "What do ya fink gwandpa??" Pausing, and taking a few curious sniffs of the air, "What's dat smell?"

<TITLE> The Traveling Planet - A Years Kiss </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-27 06:18:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.

Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

"They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

"Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.

"I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched a video about an African pastor who had an out of body experience (OBE) in which he died and saw [Heaven and Hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA7mtcJ748U) and was brought back to life. The angel told him that if he died right now he would go to Hell because he did not forgive his wife of what she had done in the past. This filled me with a lot of fear, as I wondered what other Sins I may be committing that could detrimentally send me to Hell if I did not make myself right with God and how I go about that. It confused me, as well, making me thankful that Jesus presented this pastor with his separating Sin but wonder where the line is drawn where we are covered by grace but also held accountable? 

I know this crosses the barrier of works vs grace, but I need some Biblical encouragement and clarification. Maybe some personal experiences? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in the basement and my room has a bathroom on the other side of the room. In the dream, I thought I saw strange lights coming from the bathroom. Wearing only my undies, I went over to investigate. As I approached the door, I can hear a vibratory noise growing louder with every closing step. In a bold curiosity, I burst open the door to witness three shadowy figures standing side by side in my bathroom, one substantially taller in the center of them. The vibrational noise was nearly deafening and originated from a black portal that stretched the length of the wall. It was wide enough for one person to enter through at a time and had a purple energetic hue pulsating around it. In fear of these featureless entities, I immediately fall backwards out of the bathroom grasping the knob, pulling the door closed. Nearly instantly, I snap out of my shock and am determined that whatever they are doing is malevolent. Being already on the floor, I thrust my body into the door to stop whatever it is they are doing. Now there is a large gust of energy and sound that is pressing back to keep me from entering. I am barely able to peak my head in as my hair flies back from the propulsive forces. I witness the two smaller entities begin to depart by stepping casually through the portal. In utter terror, I am left beholding the larger creature standing before me. He proceeds to slowly turn, that which I consider to be the shape of his head, in my direction. I lay pressed against the door and forceful winds, vulnerable and powerless as to his next action. Suddenly, he projects a grotesque  image of a mummified face, wrappings loosely hanging off, and shoots this illusion in my direction with a swift breath. I am abruptly overtaken with a fearful paralysis that casts me to the ground, shutting the door.  That's when I wake up.  </TEXT>

If his wallet was found at the scene of the burning building, how was his ID identified at the U.S./Mexican border? Was the character of Dorner a creation of the media to distract us from something? There just seems to be a lot of contradictions that I am not understanding.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-01-28 09:56:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What are the riches that we receive in Heaven? I've realized I am nothing without God, and I have put my faith in salvation in Jesus as He who has given me the grace to enter His Father's kingdom. My only issue is that sometimes I do not always go "without sin" and I am ashamed of this. I'd ask that you pray for me about this. I am also curious as to what are the riches of Heaven that we receive? Do some of us get a gold mansion and others end up in a cardboard box? I would be okay with being homeless in Heaven than a landlord in Hell. Once again, I'd ask that you would pray that I would see no pleasure in Sin and love God through obedience, and if you can help me to understand my overlying question, thanks! Jesus is endless gracious :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see a lot of evil in this world, especially in the corruption of the United States government. Don't get me wrong, I understand the power of prayer and the coming of Jesus one day, but is it wrong of me to want to make a change with violence? Our forefathers were Christian, and they fought for their independence from tyranny a few hundred years ago. Is it such a bad thing to want to take a stand against the direction that I see our nation heading towards? Some may not see our country going in the direction of evil and tyranny that I perceive but I can feel it in my bones and feel it necessary to make some sort of serious change or resistance in the future. Any thoughts? Please consider what I'm saying, because countries like Germany and China have disarmed their citizens prior to enslaving them in past and I see it coming soon. It's obvious Satan has infiltrated our government long ago. I just need some serious discourse. Thank you.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-01-08 06:12:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At times when I read the Gospels I feel this amazing sense of freedom from sin when Jesus preaches his purpose and in the later books that speak about works NOT being what gets you to Heaven. But then I see other scriptures that talk very highly of repentance and completely ridding your life of sin or else you will go to Hell. It creates this confusion, or paradox that leaves me stranded in my Faith. There are certain sins that I struggle with daily, and am trying to overcome. Yet because I have not overcame them, I feel various preaches condemning me to Hell, even though I have faith that Jesus is my representative before God and has justified me. I don't use Jesus to reason why I should continue sinning, I just fall sometimes and I can't comprehend this mixed message of Law vs Grace.  </TEXT>

Apparently I will be one of the only RN's they have and their pay is, from what I heard, "an insult to RNs" - 15$/hr. Which for me is fine, as its a pay increase from minimum wage and I need the experience. Any advise from other nurses who worked in the assisted living field?  </TEXT>

What's even weirder is sometimes I'll wake up, have a hearty breakfast and want to go right back to sleep for a few more hours. I'm also struggling finding a real job out of college and I don't know if that is creating a depression inside myself that also adds to my desire to sleep. But I'm also just generally interested in the normal changes that happen to the human body entering into the winter months. Thanks  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For most Christian men, masturbation is a struggle. Lust is accompanies it. About three weeks ago I stopped looking at porn/masturbating and felt incredibly strong in my faith. Oddly enough, the temptations became stronger as I felt my hormones rising daily. My hope was to have a wet dream - so I'd feel blameless etc etc. I didn't and just today I suddenly gave in and now I feel super guilty. But people alert me that guilt is not from God, and that it's not through anything we do that gets us to Heaven but through Christ alone and what He did on the cross. So, why do I still feel this incredibly amount of guilt when I should, quite possibly, be joyous that even in my lows, Jesus still loves me?

Thanks

PS - also, I gave in kind of after I felt that I had received what I wanted, which was a passing grade on a huge certification exam. I told myself that didn't play into it and that I just wanted to love and obey God, but I feel that after getting what I wanted, my selfish motives were presented 10 fold. Thoughts/prayers? and thnx

<TEXT> When I asked my father about the recent bombings, he responds by saying that he hopes they kill all of those muslim radicals. I try to explain to him that the situation is a lot more complicated than that and that Israel is more so to blame than Pakistan and that Israel is just as horrible to Pakistani people, he just brushes me off. He tries to quote the news but I attempt to explain to him that the news is going to paint our allies in a good light because the news is run by Israel and his immediate response is , "oh, you're an Antisemite". And it's just so frustrating trying to have a conversation with him because he sees everything from the perspective of a closed minded american who sits on his couch and watches football all day. I just don't feel educated on the topic enough to present my points out reasonably. Can someone help me to justify that Israel isn't as good as we make them out to be and why we're even allies with them?

<DATE> 2012-11-15 03:52:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I met this non-Christian girl and we hit it off very well initially. It went so well as for me to, in some ways, set aside my belief that Christians have to marry other Christians, as I thought it would be too closed minded for me to give up an opportunity with someone like her. She is very kind, beautiful and loving and we had a great time the first few times we hung out. She then, randomly, alerted me over text message that she is in a 2 year relationship that is now long distance, but obviously still wanted to be friends. When I heard that, I actually cried, it was embarrassing, and I was at work and my boss saw me and let me go home. I thought I'd probably never hear from her much after that but she would still contact me in the mornings via text to see how my day was going and we went on a hike where I was able to share the gospel with her and very briefly express my feelings and desire to maintain friendship (tho I want more). As much as I figured the relationship would remain platonic, the generally flirtatious messages were still being sent from her. Eventually I felt as though she was tapering me out of her life, as I didn't receive any messages for a few days. But then, just yesterday she invited me over to watch a movie with her. We did so and nothing happened but at this point I just don't know how to take her. Because in her mind, she might think she has cleared the air with me and can play the innocent card if I confront her about our purposes together, but I can't help but feel as if though she is using me just for attention/back up in case things with her boy friend don't work out. I on the other hand struggle deeply because, I want to do the things of God and love her unconditionally without expectation, and not even focus on a relationship, but my internal fleshly desires want something more and its really confusing/tearing me up inside. I constantly feel like there are things unsaid between us, and I am afraid to be completely honest with her as I fear that I will ruin what we have or what God is using me for in her life. At the root, I know that the only relationship I require is in Christ, but I am struggling deeply and could use some wise interpretations as to what is occurring. Thank you. </TEXT>

The reviewer was literally embarrassing to listen to because he acted like he was blown away and was about as bad at acting as the new Master Chief voice actor. I own Halo 4 and aside from graphics, the gameplay is identical to previous iterations. Nothing about it should appeal Halo fans who actually want the series to progress, because sadly, it has not. So, I ask you, do you think these reviewers get paid to say nice things?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tonight I met someone who was beautiful, nice, had a good sense of humor and was just generally everything I was looking for. We then somehow got onto the topic of Religion and I expressed my faith in Jesus and she expressed that she is "Spiritual". It didn't end in argument, and it allowed me to share my testimony, etc. Fortunately, it didn't make things weird or anything. I would just like some advice from Christians if this would be wise to pursue if the possibility presented itself. I know what the answers are going to be, so please, help me to understand, because this person seems to be something special that doesn't come along very often. Thank you. 

EDIT: apparently she has a boyfriend. sweet. </TEXT>

I play a shooter to have fun killing things, not see the same thing over and over again.  </TEXT>

I remember when the "Passion of the Christ" came out and hearing somebody say, "The Pope came forward today and has declared after viewing 'the Passion' that, 'It is, as it was' ". 

That pissed me off because, since when is the Pope the king of God?

Then I realized that a lot of the Catholics viewing this movie would have trusted the Pope's opinion. But that still doesn't make sense to me.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [sci-fi] The Traveling Planet </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-10 05:32:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.

Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

"They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

"Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.

"I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum. </TEXT>

-got quite a few multiple answer questions, probably around 10-15 (still not sure if thats a good thing, but i hear those are higher end questions)
-only got 3 dosage calc out of 245 (which I hear the less dosage calc, the better)

Overall the test was really hard, but i feel i knew more than I did the first time (still not much lol). Was just looking for thoughts, ideas and support. :)

<TEXT> All I see on Reddit is negative statements about Romney, which I understand. But, why nothing about Obama? Why does this site lean so far left that it seems almost to refuse to give any sort of basic criticism to our current president? You would think, even by chance, that at least a few articles would make it to the front page once and a while. Am I the only one who notices this bias?... 

EDIT: Since I have you all here, I will now proceed to revealing that Satan runs this world, and dominates both the democratic and republican parties you all hold so dear. He is currently perverting the Jewish Zionists to use their endless stream of finances to rule everything you thought was for you: MEDIA, MILITARY, BANKS, and of course POLITICS. 

OBAMA is a shill, no different than BUSH and you all will live to see World War III. 9/11 was an inside job. Get off your knees and fight back

<TEXT> The Year: 2064

Grandpa walks into the living room to see his 6 year old grandson is laughing, laying prone in front of some sort of handheld gaming device while his
eyes are in REM. (Rapid Eye Movement)

"Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion


Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)


Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a 
Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"


"Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.


"Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.


"We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices.
The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse 
divided in half with central a flat surface. 

Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"


Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"


"Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"


"Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device,
at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.


"Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.


"It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.


As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age,
I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly,
within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around 
in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with
metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent 
as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa
to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.


"Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.


Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures
the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson
with cheer.


"Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.


"We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.


"What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.


"Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt. 


"OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.

"Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be 
seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.
 Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog. 
Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain
gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery. 

Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his
right leg and a grab
at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.

"Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction,
all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state. 
This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from
whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing.
A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling.
Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face
to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough
to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader.
On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.

"God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.

The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!".
A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery
with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.

<TEXT> So i failed my nclex on 7/2/12 in the state of Pennsylvania. I went to the PA dept of state to reapply for the ATT and it said they "You already have a license of this type". And I wasn't sure if I have to wait a period of time before even apply again. They didn't make the whole 45-90 waiting period very clear. Can someone give me a clear explanation on the process I should go through? thanks :)

EDIT: I called. They said if you do a re-exam you need to send in a physical paper application. False alarm, I still failed... :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> So i found out i failed the NCLEX which is the boards or test you need to pass to become a nurse. It sucks, but its obviously not the end of the world. The most frustrating issue was when i broke the news to my father, he was infuriated and continued to make a bunch of outlandish claims like, "things are gonna be changing around here!" and "You can get your own ride down to Harrisburg next time!" (the place of the test) and "This is bullshit!" - as if my failure is more of a detriment to him than it is me. He's not a christian if that's important, and I hate having issues with my dad. He's always been kind of a douche and often makes me feel like an idiot without considering my side of the story. I wanna tell him off but I also want to respect my parents and unfortunately, I still live under his roof until i can pass this stupid test and get a job. Basically, I would really appreciate prayer for passing the NCLEX test and my relationship with my father. Any advice would be cool too. Thanks.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure why /r/atheism hates christians so much. Sure, there can be some seriously ignorant followers who piss you off to the fullest extent, but not all christians are advocates of The Crusades. Not all christians molest children and try to tell you what to do. The message promoted by Jesus in the Gospels of the New Testament was that of peace, love and sacrifice. A lot of christians hold true to that and are great members of the community, helping the poor and needy. I know people like the Westboro baptist church are nuts, and a lot of other christians realize it as well. My biggest confusion with /r/atheism is, what's being accomplished by the top upvoted item being Jesus having sex with a goat? Your subreddit is flooded with this stuff. How is that evidence of people who claim to be critical thinkers, and well educated? Most of the time, rather than a legitimate debate, your subreddit is filled with hate. At times I wish the sub was renamed '/r/trolls'. It's not serving anyone. I suggest we take a step back and consider our actions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer, this is not my own material I simply felt it necessary to share

1694  Bank of England Established

First Central Bank established in the UK. Served as model for most modern central banks.

1744- Mayer Amschel Rothschild, Founder of the Rothschild Banking Empire, is Born in Frankfurt, Germany

Mayer Amschel Rothschild extended his banking empire across Europe by carefully placing his five sons in key positions. They set up banks in Frankfurt, Vienna, London, Naples, and Paris. By the mid 1800s they dominated the banking industry, lending to governments around the world and people such as the Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Cecil Rhodes.

1757- Colonial Scrip Issued in US

Debt free, fiat currency was printed in the public interest. As Benjamin Franklin said,

In the colonies we issue our own money. It is called colonial scrip. We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay no one.

1776  American Independence

1791  Congress Creates the First US Bank  A Private Company, Partly Owned by Foreigners  to Handle the Financial Needs of the New Central Government

Previously, the 13 states had their own banks, currencies and financial institutions.

1816  The Privately Owned Second Bank of the US was Chartered  It Served as the Main Depository for Government Revenue, Making it a Highly Profitable Bank

1832  Andrew Jackson Campaigns Against the 2nd Bank of the US and Vetoes Bank Charter Renewal

Andrew Jackson was skeptical of the central banking system and believed it gave too few men too much power and caused inflation. He was also a proponent of gold and silver and an outspoken opponent of the 2nd National Bank. The Charter expired in 1836.

1833  President Jackson Issues Executive Order to Stop Depositing Government Funds Into Bank of US

By September 1833, government funds were being deposited into state chartered banks.

Jan 30, 1835  Jackson Escapes Assassination. Assassin misfired twice.

1833-1837  Manufactured boom created by central bankers  money supply Increases 84%, Spurred by the 2nd Bank of the US

The total money supply rose from $150 million to $267 million.[1]

1837-1843  Terrible Depression

343 of the 850 banks in the US closed entirely as largest banks consolidated wealth and power.[2]

1861  American Civil War

1862-1863 Lincoln Over Rules Debt-Based Money and Issues Greenbacks to Fund the War

Bankers would only lend the government money under certain conditions and at high interest rates, so Lincoln issued his own currency  greenbacks  through the US Treasury, and made them legal tender. His soldiers went on to win the war, followed by great economic expansion.

April 15, 1865  Lincoln Assassinated

1881- President James Garfield, Staunch Proponent of Honest Money Backed by Gold and Silver, was Assassinated

Garfield opposed fiat currency (money that was not backed by any physical object) and was a strong advocate of a bi-metal monetary system. He had the second shortest Presidency in history.

1907- Banking Panic of 1907

The New York Stock Exchange dropped dramatically as everyone tried to get their money out of the banks at the same time across the nation. This banking panic spurred debate for banking reform. JP Morgan and others gathered to create an image of concern and stability in the face of the panic, which eventually led to the formation of the Federal Reserve. The founders of the Federal Reserve pretended like the bankers were opposed to the idea of its formation in order to mislead the public into believing that the Federal Reserve would help to regulate bankers when in fact it really gave even more power to private bankers, but in a less transparent way.

1908  JP Morgan Associate and Rockefeller Relative Nelson Aldrich Heads New National Monetary Commission

Senate Republican leader, Nelson Aldrich, heads the new National Monetary Commission that was created to study the cause of the banking panic. Aldrich had close ties with J.P. Morgan and his daughter married John D. Rockefeller.

1910  Bankers Meet Secretly on Jekyll Island to Draft Federal Reserve Banking Legislation

Over the course of a week, some of the nations most powerful bankers met secretly off the coast of Georgia, drafting a proposal for a private Central Banking system. Those in attendance included Nelson Aldrich, A.P. Andrew (Assistant Secretary of the Treasury), Paul Warburg (Kuhn, Loeb,   Co.), Frank Vanderlip (President of National City Bank of New York), Charles D. Norton (president of the Morgan-dominated First National Bank of New York), Henry Davidson (Senior Partner of JP Morgan Co.), and Benjamin Strong (representing JP Morgan).

Dec 23, 1913  Federal Reserve Act Passed

Two days before Christmas, while many members of Congress were away on vacation, the Federal Reserve Act was passed, creating the Central banking system we have today. It was based on the Aldrich plan drafted on Jekyll Island and gave private bankers supreme authority over the economy. They are now able to create money out of nothing (and loan it out at interest), make decisions without government approval, and control the amount of money in circulation.

1913  Income tax established -16th Amendment Ratified

Taxes ensured that citizens would cover the payment of debt due to the Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, which was also created in 1913.The 16th Amendment stated: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

1914  JP Morgan and Co. Profits from Financing both sides of War and Purchasing Weapons

J.P. Morgan and Co. made a deal with the Bank of England to give them a monopoly on underwriting war bonds for the UK and France. They also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France.

November 1914  Federal Reserve Banks Open

1921-1929  The Roaring 20s  The Federal Reserve Floods the Economy with Cash and Credit

From 1921 to 1929 the Federal Reserve increased the money supply by $28 billion, almost a 62% increase over an eight-year period.[3] This artificially created another boom.

1929  Federal Reserve Contracts the Money Supply

In 1929, the Federal Reserve began to pull money out of circulation as loans were paid back. They created a bust which was inevitable after issuing so much credit in the years before. The Federal Reserves actions triggered the banking crisis, which led to the Great Depression.

October 24, 1929  Black Thursday, Stock Market Crash

The most devastating stock market crash in history. Billions of dollars in value were consolidated into the private bankers hands at the expense of everyone else.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A lot of crazy youtube sources keep predicting a nuclear and/or biological attack during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Similar to the signs that pointed towards 9/11 occurring. All for the purpose of increased fear and furthered security to unite the world under one totalitarian big brother governing body. Has anyone else heard this? Please, I'm not trying to be crazy with this. I just want to hear peoples' thoughts on this that may have some sort of related information.

<TITLE> How do you explain the examples harshness of the Old Testament to those who will use those to negate the rest of the Bible? (eg. Exodus 21) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-12 09:06:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So many people use old testament verses to put down the bible and it's meaning. I personally feel a lot of the crazier stuff of the old testament like Exodus 21 is specifically addressed to the Hebrews of that time and shouldn't be pulled out of context to shut down any biblical argument. What do you think?

EDIT: I don't know, the one thing I've seen for sure is that people with different views need to meet somewhere more personal than the internet. Not to be rude, but this Christianity vs Atheist is the biggest circlejerk on Reddit </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just saw the movie, Prometheus, and even though I can see the events clearly occur before the Alien movie timeline; I'm confused how the movie directly ties in as a prequel. I felt like there were quite a few script holes and plot decisions that didn't make sense. I can't think of many off the top of my head, but the movie left me a bit jaded. 

Any ideas my Reddit friends? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My grandma has cancer. Are the doctors just milking her for insurance money? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-10 22:33:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My grandmother has cancer that has metastasized (spread) all through her body including her pancreas, liver, spleen, and spinal cord. She is 87 y.o. Her husband, my grandfather, died of cancer 4 years prior and, even though she is cheerful, has never been in good health since. The clear prognosis (likelihood of the disease progression) is terminal (death). Unfortunately, even with that most definite outcome, the physicians (doctors) insist on continuing to perform procedures; of which will be billed to her insurance company.

She suffers from severe back pain, due to the cancer's spinal cord involvement, and the physicians say they want to perform a biopsy (take out a piece of the cancer for examination) to determine the best method of pain control for her palliative care (care for someone who's dying). I, personally, have never heard of a cancer biopsy being necessary to determine specific treatment for pain. Especially palliative. 

I know I probably just seem angry and accusative, but I would like my grandmother to spend as much time at home with her family as possible before she passes. I don't want to openly know that the doctors and hospital are just trying to gain a profit from her suffering. 

If anyone with personal experience, like someone who encountered a similar situation or someone in the medical field, could shed some light on this it would be much appreciated.

PS - I'm not blood related if anyone wanted to tell me to get early screening etc. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see Michael Ironside (voice of Sam Fisher) is being replaced by a different actor in Splinter Cell: Blacklist. What I don't understand is, if the events takes place after Conviction (where Sam Fisher already seemed like he was getting older), why would they replace him with a young actor with a young voice and it even appears Sam's movement is that of young stud. Why wouldn't they just do a prequel or something, when Sam was just starting to kick ass or something. I donno, I just don't like the taste this is putting in my mouth.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is to be gained from being an Atheist? And why do people take such Pride in it?

<DATE> 2012-06-08 10:08:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like no one knows what's going on. And don't give me bullshit. You can't tell me that our 21st century minds have any iota of a clue to what the fuck all "THIS" is (the universe etc). All that has come to be is new theories, nothing proven. Life after death is NOT proven or disproven. Although, I've heard a ton more stories of near death/ out of body experiences where people say they've seen something (white light, God, whatever). I mean, holy shit, how can one be so arrogant as to utterly deny something that they have no possible way of understanding. Science is great, and has helped mankind tremendously, but to say it negates a spiritual perspective is outright stupid.

If you believe in atheism so much, why do you come to this subreddit just to be reassured that what you believe is right? Your actions are no different than the religious you shoot down (Culminating in the church of atheism).  Also, its become almost an unsaid duty of atheists to put down religion (that just seems low and also pointless). If what you believe is what you believe and that's the end of it, the need for a community to support your belief is erroneous.

Atheism doesn't help anyone either. At least religion or some sort of discipline gives people hope in something more. All atheism does is spread the word of nothingness and self-service and usually just an underlying way of expressing disgust with religion.

There's also this association with being an atheist and being educated. That's just an outright lie because, education (math, science, history etc) and personal beliefs are almost mutually exclusive and being atheist does not necessitate a higher IQ in any sense. 

Take a step back and compare yourself to anyone you know. Your understanding of this world and what's beyond holds no stronger basis than your neighbor. Before you go out of your way to explain to people the lack of an existence of a god/gods, maybe you should step out of your comfort zones and do some searching yourself. Even if that searching is within.

tl;dr - /r/atheism = /r/circlejerk

PS - all those pictures people post of "famous" atheists and their quotes - I've never seen a single one of them smiling 8( </TEXT>
