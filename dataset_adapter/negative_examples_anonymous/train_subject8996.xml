<TEXT> Reebok is complicit. They in fact did decide how much money the fighters would get. They came up with the ugly designs. They are the ones profiting from the fighters and not compensating them. They are the ones who have shown no effort in their product or the concerns of the fighters. They are just as guilty as the UFC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Frank Mir is light years better than Stann or Florian. Florian's high pitched voice is annoying. Stann doesn't understand fighting and regurgitates random facts and his broscience (like lactic acid build up in the muscles which is pure fiction). 

If the UFC spends money on focus groups to determine who is the best, I have no doubt Frank Mir will beat out everyone on the B team.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arizona is very diverse in terms of politics. A large majority of people are not racist. The state is independent heavy. In Maricipa County (location of metropolitan phoenix), the most populated county, the Republicans do win out. Down south in Tucson they're far more democrat. I know Arizona seems like a solid red state but that might not always be the case. With changing demographics we will certainly eventually go purple and very well could turn blue in a decade or two.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear sir or madam, in reality increasing a minimum wage [creates more jobs](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/pages/job-loss). The lowest earners spend their money unlike the wealthy. When they spend their money this creates more economic growth and more jobs. The economic data is out there and it concludes increases in minimum wages increase the number of jobs in the free market. If we can supplement that with additional government created employment, it would create even more jobs and give us a strong economy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> PoliSci, plan was law school. Worked at a law firm, then later at the court. Dragged my feet for years, and since the legal field is dying somethin' fierce, I decided to go into healthcare which I'm pursuing right now. What are you thinking of doing? Criminal Justice field? Legal field? If the latter, I would advice you to be practical and look into it and be 100% it's what you want, because law school is not a good investment anymore. Back in the day (say before 2006ish) there were many well paying jobs out of school. Now, even people out of Ivy league schools in the top 10% of their classes are struggling. Partnerships in law firms are diminished. Plus, keep in mind something 90% of lawyers don't see a courtroom. They're in the office 12/hours a day doing paperwork. 

I think choosing something that will get you a well paying job out of school is the best route to go, regardless of what you want to do after your undergrad, be it law or something else. So if you did engineering, accounting, nursing, computer science, etc something practical like that, you'd still have  something to fall back on.

<TEXT> Barack campaigned as a progressive. He ended up governing as a center of right moderate. He didn't even try to get the public option. Somehow he's called a socialist by the right who more insane every day with the tea party. The Jewish guy who is a socialist democrat is the only honest candidate. He puts American workers first. He doesn't have corporations and the banking industry backing him like Hillary Clinton.

<TEXT> Because America is run by corporations and special interests like the NRA (national rifle assocation). They own about 95% of all politicians. They don't serve the interests of the citizenry. Also, our values are defunct. We have mass shootings all the time, but people value extreme gun rights more than they do people's lives. This is why it's a lot easier to purchase a gun than it is to vote. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are the chances Floyd Mayweather fights Gennady Golovkin in September? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-10 12:09:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mayweather has already defeated Cotto, Alvarez, and Pacquiao. Amir Khan appears beneath his level. 

Why not put Golovkin in front of Mayweather and watch what he can do? Beating an undefeated, soon to be 20 knockouts in a row, and larger fighter would be the most difficult challenge of his apparent options, and if he wins, it would solidify his position as TBE.

<TEXT> My school offered an unsubsidized loan that covers only half of my tuition. I think I have reached the 57.5k total limit. I have to find the rest of the tuition, a few thousand in nursing school fees, books, etc. I'm male. I have a previous bachelors degree in a social science. 90% of the 57.5k is from nursing school. A $10-15/hr job probably won't cut it.  I could use some realistic ideas. Nothing illegal. </TEXT>
