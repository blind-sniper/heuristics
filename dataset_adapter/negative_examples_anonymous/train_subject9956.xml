Makes you wonder if in the future our present science will be viewed similarly primitive, if despite all the development and refining of scientific method (our present science may seem almost perfected) we have overlooked/didn't consider something. Or rather,  scientists know they have,  because of all the yet unexplained phenomena like nature of dark matter or presence of technetium in some stars.  </TEXT>

Pathogens are fairly easy to grow (I'd know as I routinely grew bacteria in high school and it was often contaminated by more dangerous bacteria) and you don't need acces to the water supply to be able to infect a lot of people - you could smear it all over public transport or air vents or something. There probably wouldn't be many (if any) deaths, but you might sow fear in people's minds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All schools I went to were public and they were good. But I live in Europe and don't know what the situation is in the USA, so I am not qualified to judge it, I think.

Still, I think it just isn't worth it to send your daughter into faith-based schools (faith-based education is a little bit of an oxymoron, isn't it?) and take a risk that she ends up being indoctrinated.

On the other hand, if you guide her to skepticism and reason, she might be able to learn about Christianity while keeping her sanity intact. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [SPOILER] Help with the song lyrics </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-10 23:03:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, the newly released animatic of the super amazing feely ubersong is so epic that I need your help to fill in what I missed and overheard in transcribing it
[Here is the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETMPVpJDHoA) and here is my draft of the lyrics (I am updating it at the moment):

EDIT: The MLP wiki seems to have been updated, there is no need for my continued existence now. Copypasted text:


        I'm here to show you who I am 

        Throw off the veil, it's finally time 

        There's more to me than glitz and glam, ooh 

        And now I feel my stars align 


        For I had believed what I was sold 

        I did all the things that I was told 

        But all that has changed, and now I'm bold 

        'Cause I know 


        That I am just a pony 

        I make mistakes from time to time 

        And now I know the real me 

        And put my heart out on the line 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        Just like the magic inside of you 


        And now I see those colors 

        Right before my eyes 

        I hear my voice so clearly 

        And I know that it is right 


        I thought I was weak, but I am strong 

        They sold me the world, but they were wrong 

        And that I'm back I still belong 

        'Cause I know 


        That I am just a pony 

        I make mistakes from time to time 

        And now I know the real me 

        And put my heart out on the line 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true, whoa, whoa, whoa 

        Just like the magic inside of you 


        Just like the magic inside of you

Some religious groups would go out of their way to deny that, conspiracy theorists would have group orgasm, plethora dank memes would be spawned, but nothing that would affect everyday life in any way.

I just don't see that much happening.

<TEXT> Yes, I have.  I am a brony, and I know people who have their rooms full of merchandise (i don't), but that doesn't mean they're creepy (most of them are kind, friendly people, who just enjoy it). If they ever do some doll photo op like this, they do it in jest.

That said, there are people who are actually mentally unwell and delusional about their waifus (the word is also mostly used ironically) - I recall one who was **really** possesive about one of the characters and had all sorts of fantasies about their mutual love and was jealous of others liking her, really argumentative about it; was allegedly also physically violent toward his classmates -, but that is more of an exception. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. And there are two more reasons I stopped playing. 

1. I am a chicken, so I played on Peaceful. But on Peaceful you can't craft many items because there are no materials that only come from monsters. (it was more than a year since I last seriously played MC, so correct me if I am wrong)

2. There are so many craftable items, but there is no ingame documentation. I get that it is meant to be discovered by the player, but I think there should be ingame wiki for those that want it. The need to have MC wiki open in the browser ruins immersion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Humans are not born with developed bullshit detectors. If they don't know the criteria by which to judge if something is true, or if admitting they are wrong would contradict their deeply held beliefs, people will happily believe bullshit. Consider people who believe even the most credulous things (New Age woo etc...) without equally strong evidence.

People also do some pretty dumb stuff. Even if 50 % of the stories on the subreddits like /r/FloridaMan , /r/NewsOfTheStupid , or /r/offbeat were fake and the other 50 % true there would still be quite a few some pretty dumb stuff people do.

Have you read /u/MyLifeSuxNow's story about his bitch wife? Afaik in the end settled Reddit found out that it is made up when people were pointing inconsistencies in it. And yet, it wasn't a very credulous story, I could totally see that happen. I thought it plausible, so I believed it until other people called BS. No big deal, it was just a funny story anyway.

And it is by no means the only example of me being fooled by a story and it most probably won't be the last. Hell, I even believed some of the more known conspiracies when I was younger and less educated - I think it's important I remind myself of it every so often, just to be more compassionate to other people. I am not perfect.

BTW  with "there is a real contingent out there who literally wants to "kill all cis white men"" part you reminded me of something I heard in one podcast, where the podcaster gave a story how he and some guy with a different opinion fiercely argued over the internet and called each other names, yet when they incidentally met IRL they laughed at it and had a reasonable civil discussion. I think most people would also be civil in such a situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It always makes me think what those people think it is about the age of consent that somehow magically makes fucking someone who was 15 the day before when it was "wrong by most people's moral code" absolutely OK the next day? (age of consent is 16 in many countries, mind you) Fucking a 9 year old (let alone a toddler) would, I think, be "wrong by most people's moral code", but the claim that with 15 year olds it's the same is just silly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if interesting, but quite embarrassing - when I was in primary school, one winter day I and my classmate were going to wait for the public transport and we somehow thought it would be fun to throw chunks of frozen snow in front of passing cars. We kept doing it for a few minutes and then a policeman came from the nearby police station (it was in fact next to a police station) and warned us not to do that

It was incredibly stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was playing on a crappy PCs until a year or so ago when I built my own powerful PC. As always, at first sight 60fps is butter smooth and you get used to it, so it doesn't even seem so after while. But then you get a game where fps was locked at 30fps and it takes a while to get used to it and it looks quite jittery at first or even after during quick camera movements.

Look here, you will see the difference

I'd say it is definitely worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is that the religion virus preys on naturally selected human characteristics like pareidolia, superstition, pattern-recognition abilities (these three got a lot in common), the drive to protect offsprings, the self-preservation instinct, and other things.

You gotta train and educate people in critical thinking and skepticism to recognize inborn human fallabilities, whereas faith and religion thrive on the lack of these things.

It's a hard fight, and it may be that some form of religion always arises and it is thus virtually unweedable, but it is worth trying to get people to be more reasonable, because it brings progress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, people keep asking, though, so here's a copypasta of the explanation:

It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting. </TEXT>

The visitors do that often and it is just by luck when I find out and shelve it correctly during my shift, and there is like one big audit a year for the public part of the library. Please, try to get books back to their place. </TEXT>

I wonder why, it defeats the purpose of having to kill your sis to obtain it. Solus Greatsword should be less powerful. </TEXT>

I liked Spore, but it could be a lot better. So much potential, and it was actually quite fun at times. I also regret buying Galactic Adventures, because I only tried them once or twice and never played it again.

<TEXT> Imo videogames can be very enriching experiences. You can learn from them and try things you couldn't in real life, they provide catharsis from stress and much more.

 Sometimes I think that I waste my life with videogames, but other times I see that it is not necessarily bad. "Get a life" is a poor argument, because "getting a life" is not very well defined activity - I have a feeling that is mostly mean "be a complete square", because it is often used at gamers, anime fans and other such subcultures.

Of course it is not the real thing you, but you can draw insights and ideas from them, and it can change your view on certain subjects or even life itself. Experiences are not just physical activities, mental experience counts too - reading a book is similar, though not interactive, and most people consider this and that book to be an experience. Thus, I conclude that it can't be said that videogames are not experiences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kerbal Space Program:

- total lack of documentation of controls

- as of yet no 64-bit

- waste of educational potential; it is educational in itself, but if there was a in-game wiki friendly explaining the science and mathematics behind the orbital mechanics, it would have been enourmously advantageous - games are the most natural form of learning

- lack of some underlining story - afaik the easter eggs were planned to have been connected and to point to a faraway planet whence Kerbals come from

- I was actually kind of disappointed when I heard that the Kerbol system is actually unrealistically small. It might have been better with real-scaled planets

- lack of faster time warp - as RSS shows, it is doable, and waiting isn't much fun

- Lack of more structures on the planets and moons

<TEXT> I hated playing it because of only one reason - it frikkin scared me. I don't like horror games - I can play some, though, like more action ones like L4D or KF -, call me a chicken but I can't do it. 

On my first playthrough I got scared shitless almost to the end of Ravenholm and I stopped playing there until two years later (recently), when I thought fuck it and finished the game with cheats - it made it much easier for me. Subsequently I made it through E1 and I have yet to complete E2.

I think best thing about HL games is the world itself, the lore, the story and the atmosphere - it is mysterious, alien, attractive, and desolate. I am no big HL fan, but there is much to be read about it on the internet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had always had obsolete PCs, mostly second-hand - I had spent a good amount of time gazing at screenshots in game magazines, drooling and dreaming. I had never thought I would ever play those shiny shiny games. I know very well the ails of lowest setting gaming and slow 90s PCs. The breaking point came a year ago when I knew I would have a part-time job and I was wiser and knew that my dream could come true, especially thanks to Reddit.

Prior to the building I thoroughly went through every BaPC guide and BaPC-recommended guide to learn how to build a PC, I even went through rookie-mistake-horrors threads. When I finally picked the parts after some googling and consideration, I asked here if it is good and subsequently changed over half of the parts according to advice. I am not a good picker, I guess.

The building itself went good, though I was nervous as hell and it took me all day. Like "Gosh, my fingers sweat so much, argh, my hard-earned two-month pay have just gone out of window it will all burn out on the first go" everytime I touched anywhere. I don't think I should worry so much about touching the components, should I? The feeling when it turned on was worth it, though.

The sad thing is, I remember how to connect and take out parts and whatnot (during building I was surprised that I almost didn't need a guide how to connect the parts together, it is very obvious - literally, as BaPCers say, like a Lego), but by now I have wholly forgotten what to look for when picking parts (unlike some people here who just go to the store and casually pick up good compatible parts), but I suppose I can consult the internet when the need arises. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree a bit. It is now commonly thought that spirituality has to do with supernatural, but Saganian definition of spirituality applies to us all. I wish the word "spiritual" wasn't associated with the supernatural, superstitious or gullible.

 Spirit comes from the Latin word to breathe. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything outside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.

<TEXT> No, I am not him. I was asked a couple of times before though. I have identified with this nickname since primary school. Copypaste of my username's origin :

It has nothing to do with fun. It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting.

Btw it's uncanny, though, we both live in Europe and I am just a few months older than he is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What about heat? That kill Kerbals.

[My design is somewhat simpler](http://i.imgur.com/05wzTZL.jpg) (sorry for it not being transparent, there are two cubic struts on top of each other with 2 batteries and 2 seats on sides and 1 parachute on the top inside).  I tested it and it works, the fairings proved to be necessary since the heat/hot air killed the kerbal even behind the heat shield. The spin stabilization works, no need for a reaction wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am currently designing a lightweight escape pod for two Kerbals, basically seats on a cubic strut with a parachute with fairings (but I don't think they're necessary now). now I have to just solve the stabilization during activating small separating boosters, because it tends to spin instead of keep firing retrograde. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As Cooper is falling in the black hole (or is it already *somewhere else*?) we can see he is falling towards [a spherical structure](http://i.imgur.com/vFciagz.jpg). Given his relative size to [the space of the tesseract](http://i.imgur.com/LD4OvfQ.jpg) and assuming a "chamber" in there is taken as a cubic space with every side being one clearly visible rectangle (or mabe rather the dimensions of Murph's room), I'd assume it could be estimated how many "chambers" there were, but I can't do the math. </TEXT>

Of course they called to me often during my life with them  to do a chore, to remind me of a responsibility, to come to dinner, to engage in conversation, to hear about an event of the day. I still miss them so much that it doesn't seem at all strange that my brain will occasionally retrieve a lucid recollection of their voices."

Just thought it would be nice to point it out, since Google search turns out twisted versions of this quote. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost all of my EPL bases are on planets (and one is in orbit above Kerbin), but I haven't as of yet tried to make a functional base on an asteroid. I am not sure if it can be mined without additional plugins (and screw realism, infinite fuel asteroid deposit ftw). Can it? </TEXT>

Does anyone know a solution? </TEXT>

Can't grab them and I doubt I can shatter/smash them with robotic arms. I set up a second launchpad, but I don't want to abandon this one.

<DATE> 2015-02-11 14:14:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Upon "finishing" my 0.90 career mode, I started a new game with a couple of other mods, namely Karbonite, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and SCANSat so I try building fully self-sufficient bases elsewhere and explore the system more easily.

I have finally understood how those work, but I am having problems setting the SCANSat big map to the resources mode. It just still displays altitude map. I have sent a probe with both Magnetometer and SAR detector in a polar orbit of Minmus (I don't know whether SCANSat detector is enough). Do I have to activate the magnetometer? It didn't show the option before activating the detector, but activating the detector keeps my energy drained at 0.01, so I have no way to check, because it won't let me.

<TITLE> Does it matter if you are bad at multiplayer? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-03 22:59:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have never been particularly good at multiplayer shooter games (and I don't play them often, so I am not very skilled), usually I was in the bottom half of the scoreboard, but I always enjoyed myself. The thing is, it feels a bit embarrasing being told by games how bad I am, which for me leads to frustration (rather than motivation to be better, because I know I will never be a top-scoring player anyway) and loss of interest in the game for me after some time.

What are your feelings about it and about low-scoring players? BTW I am not looking for comfort, so please speak your honest opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you put a small engine on the bottom of a rocket/tank with larger diameter than  that of said engine, then when you attach something to the engine from below it creates fairings, but those have only the engine's diameter.

It can be secured with struts, for sure, but it looks ugly as hell, and having to meddle with Procedural Fairing's interstage fairings is a bother.

Is there any mod which makes it right? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Troubleshooting] Connecting things to PSU </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-12 23:29:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After X hours of building I am exhausted, so I am going to make it simple:

I have to plug the GPU and 2 fans (front and rear) into the PSU.

GPU has connector, which is split in two, each of them looks like this

 I o x x x I

Both fans also have dual connectors, but they are each different:

 I x x x x I

 I o o o o I

"x"s represent pins, "o"s are holes

The PSU is modular, and I have one cable which corresponds to GPU's and fans' connectors. 


From PSU end, it goes like this:

 I o o o o I

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 IooooI    (a small header connector)

How should I plug it all to the PSU? It doesn't seem doable. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Build Help] Can 430V PSU run an entire PC with GPU with recommended 500 V voltage? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-11 09:23:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am about to order all components for my first build and I was skimming through my picked parts when I noticed that PSU was 430 V and recommended voltage for GPU was 500 V.

So I searched for a bit and found a similar question here on BaPC where was said that recommended GPU voltages are for the whole system.

I also used a PSU calculator and it showed me that even less voltage is needed (400 V), so that confused me even more.

How do I make sense of it?

If it turns out to be OK, this post might be regarded as Build Ready I guess. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Build Help] Should I get SSD before HDD? Or SHDD? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-09 21:28:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have decided on my first build, but today I remembered that people recommend to install OS on a SSD. The problem is that I do not have enough money at the moment to buy both at once, so I am torn if I should get a SSD first and add HDD later, or go for some SSHD.

I have to decide quick, since I am going to buy all components tommorrow, so if you could recommend me some drive, it would be great.

Here are the parts I have picked.

My budget is maybe 20 000 K (960.20 USD), this build without SSD would cost me 23 741 K (1139.81 USD).

I can add a new screen and SSD later, but it is going to suck until then (my current screen is a tiny 1024x768 one).

I would appreciate your help with rating this build and, if possible, recommending something cheaper. I didn't make this [Build Ready], because I am not entirely sure yet.

Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> After playing a real obscene number of hours in Kerbal Space Program, I got into Simple Rockets pretty well, even landed on the Smoon and Smars - it is a bit easier thanks to being 2D - but I can't seem to be able to match velocity with rendezvoused-with ships. Docking was one of my favourite activities in KSP and I was quite good at it, but afaik there is nothing like relative velocity nullifying marker in SR. I managed to dock only once, and it was not very graceful, which is displeasing.
I don't know how to use that grey thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> a) Every so often I experience a bug where the ship starts to rotate (using reaction wheels, it consumes power) by itself and only SAS keeps it in check and I can't get rid of it (not even by reloading). I suspect it has something to do with using physical/time warp or SAS toggling while rotating. Does anyone else experience this? How to get rid of it?

b) Is it possible to jettison an engine without having it set as an action group? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fellow froods and froodesses!
Every Earth year on May the 25th, we hold a tradition of visibly carrying towels around with us, because on this date, there is a regular increase in flying saucers fly-bys, though we can't see them easily due to SEP field, and we have to be prepared for sudden untold adventures, Earth demolitions or serendipitious petunia materalizations.

In every case, this act also serves as a homage to Douglas Noel Adams, who ~~wrote~~ received from extraterrestrial beings this utterly extraordinary trilogy in five parts, and decided to share it with us.

Whatever happens this day, don't panic. Or every other day, for that matter... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since 0.23.5, I am often experiencing a weird time warp/gravity physics bug, where all parts of my vessel except the main part (capsule or whatever) go limp (as if in a freefall without horizontal speed), it becomes fixed (meaning it doesn't move and it is not affected by neither pressing keys or burning) and the trajectory changes rapidly even when not burning. When I try to time warp again it says that the time warp cannot be used under acceleration, or it disassembles rapidly. 

It happens in orbit around Kerbin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sometimes go there to see what retarded things people say there, and it never fails me laugh. But it also enrages me a little, when I what turds can people spew of their mouths, and how ignorant some of them are - religion serves them as an excuse to not seek reason, to abandon critical thinking, to embarras themselves. Cattle do not see the stars and think they are special in the universe. In comparsion with immersity of the universe, we are uncomparably less than nothing.

I hope there won't be a shortage of people who publicly present reason, science, atheism etc. to people, because I have a grave feeling that it might actually be possible for the world to become a place where non-believers would be put ot death, if there would be no vocal opposition.

Just wanted to get this off my chest, carry on, or discuss it, if you wish. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [In the newest infostorm](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/265-Kerbal-Space-Program-Asteroid-Redirect-Mission-The-FAQ) there was this passage.

 **What is this Claw thing?**

The Advanced Grappling Device, or claw, is your primary means of capturing an asteroid. The Claw works very much like a docking port, however, it doesnt require a mate node to dock to. That means it can grab on to almost any object. Once grabbed on, you can even transfer fuel from the grabbed objects (provided they have any). 

Does this mean that regular docking ports become less useful? This wording implies that I can just launch a fuel tank tank with a probe on it into orbit and suck from it with this claw thingy. </TEXT>

I read on the wiki that lighter probes don't even need a parachute on Jool, so I don't think it would be completely impossible. What do you Kerbal rocket scientist think?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was on Minmus with Bill and Bob. On the top of a lander there was a rolling probe, so i rolled it about 1,5 km away, did some measurements and flew with Jeb to collect data (well, more slid than flew).

When i was a few tens of meters from it, i switched to probe to slightly angle it for convenience. When i wanted to switch back, there was no Jeb.

He disappeared.

I was confused at first and looked for him all over, but he simply vanished. I went to Astronaut Complex and he is listed as MIA.

What the hell?

BTW when i planted the flag i named it Jebediah's Vision after that creepypasta; coincidence much? </TEXT>

If i did not watch some Manley's video i wouldn't know it... I thought i figured the game by myself. Well, i have a lot to learn yet.

Edit: And of course the rest of controls too, i forget to mention it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just finished latest episode of Doctor Who, here is my boring little wall of text (really, nothing interesting) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-23 16:30:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Note: I am a fan of 2005's Doctor Who. I am not planning on watching older series, i am quite content with the new.

I must say it is one of the best series i've seen. About a year ago i started to hear from my friends how good it is, they posted DW related things on Facebook and i am naturally quite open-minded, so i put it on my imaginary "To watch" list, but i did not rush in any way, actually, it was one of my new classmates who gave me needed push.

First episodes were feeling like it was a cheap TV production - it probably was, and i do not complain - and it got better with time. I love series which have consistent universe, and DW satisfied me in this way.

Not everyone may see it same, but i like how they put homosexuality in there every so often - i am not a homosexual or in LGBT community, but i am happy for those people, i support them (of course i like gay jokes and so on, but that is different). I also felt some atheist themes in the series, that was pleasant too. I also very like the Doctor's "no guns" policy, it's not something you can see very often today.

I sure am going to continue watching, though i call myself just a fan (don't really have urge to call myself whoovian yet; maybe this will be my backup fandom) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I flew to the Mun and collected high amount of scientific data, but i underestimated needed power to get back to Kerbin, and poor Kerbal must have EVAed (of course with data) and set himself on stable orbit. So i send first rescue - it was a probe with four solar panels, i don't know how, but i managed to position the way that no light could reach them, thus rendering probe dead. For my second try i attached two 1x6 automatic panels to it and i even managed to get rendezvous orbit - but in the wrong way! Now i am going for my third try. Wish me luck!

EDIT: Finally! That was insane, it took 4 tries before i managed to pick up poor Kerbal, and then i had to position vessel hanging on a parachute so he won't fall off his seat (another valuable lesson - always using capsules). </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, a few weeks earlier a guy stopped me near the place i go to school. It turned out the guy is a Hindu preacher, trying to sell some books about Krishna and talk people into religion.

I kinda like him, we talk for a moment every time i go that way, but he appears to be very brainwashed/clearly instructed. First, when i told him i am an atheist, he tried to tell me atheism is a religion (i told him it is in fact absence of faith). Today i told him i read The God Delusion and he went on how atheist don't know facts and write about it (i even told him Dawkins has all sourced), whereas religious books are true (particularly his own religion's one, obviously, because when i told him e.g. Bible and Quran are just books, that it is not an evidence of anything, he seemed to agree).

I am not sure if it's worth trying to learn him at least anything, I don't know if he listens. But I don't particularly like arguing with people, so i am not pushing anything. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

i do not expect to be many Czech people here, but i am going to post it anyway. With help from couple of other Czech bronies i managed to finish Czech Subtitles for the first part of [Brony Chronicles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EOfhvvURY feature=player_embedded).

It was difficult, but i am proud of it. I do not expect it to be well-received here, but even if one person find it useful i will be happy.
BTW yes, i already posted it on Czech forums.

It it for 720p version downloaded off YouTube.

<DATE> 2013-08-13 13:17:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Psychonauts is an older game, yet it is my THE MOST favourite game ever and i will tell you a few reasons why:

* It's very different than any other games in terms of its originality
* Art style is fantastic even with limited texture resolution and limited amount of polygons
* The game is very humorous and funny
* Each level offers its own unique gameplay 
* Game setting is quite joyful and the plot is intriguing
* It has many things to collect, which serves not only for a sole purpose of being collected, but it's important for game progress.

Albeit it's an older game, the time hasn't taken anything from its enjoyability. If you pass off on it, you will miss one of the most original games ever created. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Starswirl the Bearded was a powerful magician, who lived more than 1000 years ago. He invented spell to transform a pony (unicorn or pegasus) into an alicorn. The regal sisters used this spell to become alicorns and thus defeat Discord (and then Sombra). They kept the book for themselves and Celestia is testing her pupils (many generations of them). If they prove themselves to be worthy enough, Celestia reward them with turning them to alicorns. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Today I found a quite interesting (and somehow truthful) quote from Terry Deary, British writer. It's too long to put in title, but it's worth reading. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-25 08:26:03 </DATE>

<TEXT> Today i found quite shocking (and somehow truthful) quote from Terry Deary: 
"I've no interest in schools. They have no relevance in the 21st century. They were a Victorian idea to get kids off the street. Who decided that putting 30 kids with only their age in common in a classroom with one teacher was the best way of educating? At my school there were 52 kids in the class and all I learned was how to pass the 11-plus. Testing is the death of education. Kids should leave school at 11 and go to work. Not down the mines or up chimneys, mind, but working with computers or something relevant. Everything I learned after 11 was a waste of time. Trigonometry, Boyle's law: it's never been of any use to me. They should have been teaching me the life skills I was going to need, such as building relationships, parenting and managing money. I didn't have a clue about any of these things at 18. Schools need to change."
