<TEXT> So there is a show (albeit a stupid one) that I don't remember the name of. Now, I was young at the time, so I was scared of pretty much anything. Anyway, I was browsing through the TV show list, and I saw that show on the list (called "haunted" or something). I knew it would be scary (yes, I could read at the time) so I asked my mom if I could watch this.
Now, she was in the shower at the time, at the other side of the house, so she thought I said "Hunting", so she told me I could watch it. (Hunting is also inappropriate for kids, but OK mom.)
I watched it, and it was something stupid about fairies, but I got spooked.
The next day, I went to s-c-h-o-o-l. SUCH A FUN EXPERIENCE! I was afraid to go to the bathroom, cuz everyone knows those darn fairies will get you if you're alone in a bathroom, so I peed in a bush when no one was looking.
That bathroom thing went away after a couple of days, but I was still scared of the dark for a long time.
TL;DR: I got spooked by scary fairies, had to piss in bushes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's one for 299 starting bid, and its new: http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view id=141600217704 alt=web 
If you bid for $300 for it, no one will outbid you. Personally though, I would get the sandstone black (64gb) version. I mean, 4 times the storage and only $50 more! In comparison, that change costs $200 in an iPhone. </TEXT>
