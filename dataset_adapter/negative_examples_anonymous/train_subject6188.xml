<TEXT>  They are far from cute and cuddly.

They are mean mothers all right! 

I remember when I was a kid and we were living in the burbs of Chicago. One night, I went to let our dogs in to the house from their pen when they tore off to the back of the yard and cornered one. Fortunately, my mom heard the commotion, and when she yelled at the pups, they ran back towards the house. 

I'll never forget those glowing, beady eyes and that hissing sound. 

Course, I was a little guy, but it sure seemed big. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Could you introduce yourselves?**

Hey there, I'm /u/train_subject6188! I've been on Reddit for almost two years now.

**How did you get involved here?** 

To be honest, there were three reasons I started the sub, one of which /u/carmabound has already covered. The second was that I joined the Mod Squad at /r/worldnews about a year and a half ago and thought it would be a good idea to learn how to do mod stuff without accidently tripping over the wires and unplugging a default. The third reason was there really isn't a sub out there that will allow me to post my jabberwocky.

**How would recommend your sub to new users**

If you're looking for a place to chill out and hang, pour yourself a drink and come talk story.


**Aims for this subreddit?**

Haven't the slightest clue.

**Favorite posts?**

All of them on /r/train_subject6188, of course! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lurked here at first because, as some of you may know, I've been living between Honolulu and Tokyo for quite some time now, but due to my family situation, most of that time has been spent here in Tokyo.

Don't get me wrong, I love Japan, it's just that I really prefer to be in Hawaii, *especially* when I'm not actually *in* Hawaii!

Yes, Hawaii drives me nuts at times, but that's the difference between living there and just visiting.

Coming here has helped to keep me grounded, still feeling like I'm part of the community.

Even though posting pics was kind of frowned upon when I first started coming here, thankfully, the community has become more open and flexible to most things Hawaii.

Now, a big change is happening in my life because, unless something majorly bad happens, I'll be coming back to stay from the first week of August.

Because I haven't actually been living full time in Hawaii, every time I went back there, I never went on the internet, spent most of my time in the water and/or walking around.

Now, I hope to balance things out a bit and I hope to become more of an irregular regular here. I want to give back those feel-goods to those of you who are lurking and wished they were actually in Hawaii.

<TEXT> Thank you /u/moonpurr, /u/hawaiithaibro, and /u/fern420.

As you may already know, I wasn't born in Hawaii and didn't attend school here, so when I first moved here in the 90's, I did my best to read as much as I could about Hawaii and ask everyone as many questions when I could, at the proper times.

I don't try to "be Hawaiian", but I sure as heck try to "be local." And what I mean by that is taking some pride in the fact that my kids were born here, go to school here and we all need to be aware of Hawaii's past, so that we can have some sort of future here.

<TEXT> I haven't watched it straight through from Season 1, because I didn't catch on in time, but man, what a great show.

Strangely enough, it's on DLife here in Tokyo, and D means Disney.

Anyways, I digress, I really like the stories on an individual basis, but there's an ongoing arc involving the Aaron Hotchner character and boy....

I'm not going to go into any details, because spoilers for anyone who hasn't watched it but would like to, but I'm into Season 5.

Wow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Went over to Kawaguchi (Saitama) for dinner and it seems as though they're having a Tanabata candle festival going on right now in Nishi-guchi Park! Yay! A little late to promote this, but if I recall, usually 4 or 5 days before Tanabata, they have an street festival on the east side of the station.

<TEXT> What is [Ultra Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Seven) you say?

"Ultra Seven ( Urutora Sebun) is a tokusatsu science fiction TV series that aired on Japanese TV in 1967. Created by Eiji Tsuburaya, this follow up to Ultraman went on to become one of Japan's greatest fantasy TV series. Such is his popularity that Ultra Seven (or simply "Seven") has appeared or at least made cameos in nearly every Ultra Series following his own and has had far more exposure than even the original Ultraman (though the original Ultraman is without a doubt the face of the Ultras).
Ultra Seven is sometimes incorrectly called "Ultraman Seven" by many sources outside Japan (or in the case of KHON/Honolulu, Hawaii, Ultra 7, as listed in TV Guide when it ran in 1975). Both the series and its hero can also be called Ultraseven (without a space), which is generally the form used when romanized." </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is Tanabata?

"Tanabata is a Japanese festival originating from the Chinese Qixi Festival. It celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair respectively). According to legend, the Milky Way separates these lovers, and they are allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the lunisolar calendar."

It's not a national holiday, so people still have to work and it's more popular with the kids, but many places have festivals and that means food, beer and games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Due to the fact that /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub ~~in my mind~~ on Reddit, we've had to take on two new moderators in /r/Handicapreader and /u/Carmabound.

Mr. Reader has created the sky above and below us, because, well, I was drunk and/or hungover every day in high school and wasn't paying attention to my teacher in computer class. All things CSS will go through him and only him. He deserves all the credit for everything you see.

Ms. Bound will be in charge of....in charge of....well, she'll be doing the same thing I do, and that's nothing but making witty comments and having lots of pun.

I'm sure after a few months, the crew will stage a mutiny and boot me off my own sub, but lets enjoy it while it lasts, ok?

<TEXT>  That's great :)

It is and it isn't. You know me, I'm such a worry-wart that I'm wondering what will go wrong, instead of enjoying it for what it is.

 Do you already have a place to stay

Yes, I'm just waiting for the realtor to confirm the exact move in date before I buy a ticket. I know it's a holiday weekend and all, but they're kinda laid back when it comes to all things business in HI.

 and a possible job lined up

No. Will have to get on this, but I went through this before when I went from Japan to Hawaii. People don't really want to talk to you unless you're there. Maybe because so many people change their minds at the last minute, but it's next to impossible to set something up via phone/internet.

 Do you have a laptop, or are you going to disconnect again?

I do, but I'm not sure what they have there. I may be offline for a week or so, but I'll try to set something up before I go, when the actual move in date is set for sure.

Team Japan is pretty darn good though, and they do work really hard. It's just that the media coverage here is enough to drive anyone mad, unless of course your a fan of the team.

That said, ~~Brazil~~ Russia is only 2 years away, so I'm sure from tomorrow we'll be seeing how the men's Cup will coming to JP for sure!

<TEXT> I've got a *friend* who's been living off-island for pretty much the past ten years. Sure, he's popped back from time to time, every now and then, but as we all know, playing the tourist and actually living in Hawaii are two different things.

"If you left Hawaii in say, 2005, and came back today, what do you thing has changed the most about life in Hawaii?" </TEXT>
