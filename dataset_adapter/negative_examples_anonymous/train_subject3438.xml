<TEXT> I'm not really sure, it's probably 480p. I'm watching it on TV and it's a non HD channel. 

But yeah the lighting is dimmer and not as sharp, which suits Alien which is why the idea came to mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think I have ever watched a chiller movie. The dry humor of the narrator fits perfectly. You get to experience other cultures and locations around the world. I just think the movie should be studied as how to make something laid back. The music, the people, the story, The Endless Summer. 

Enough Said. Just go watch it and wind down. </TEXT>
