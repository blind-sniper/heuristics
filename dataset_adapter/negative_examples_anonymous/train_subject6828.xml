<TEXT> Inspiration hits me at any time and it can be tempting to follow it. However that could be a subconscious attempt to have you quit on a current project. I just write down what hits me and put it away to get back to later. This helps create perespective. it might be a great idea but you might have learned something about yourself or the idea that forces you to consider whether to venture writing it. For example, last night I was watching an alien b-movie and I thought " I could do this better. This movie is sending a message about the war in the middle east but the dialogue is atrocious. If I were to do this...". So after fleshing out an idea, I put it away because pursuing it would take away my concentration from the first project.

<TEXT> I have a 35mm f1.6 and a 14-45mm f3.5-5.6. I'm having trouble getting alot in focus with the latter it's usually only really close things like my guinea pig.  try to keep in mind that I'm just starting out so its most likely my fault that I'm doing something wrong. My preference would be to shoot in wide angles with a "deep depth if field." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand your point, I've been there but that is definitely plan B. I've gone over it in my head and decided that I will die happy if I can make a steady living doing SOMETHING in film. Even if I were an extra, the fact that I'd be contributing to what, to me, is a sacred form of storytelling would be enough to keep me happy. 


But I want to tell stories and help others tell theirs, I want to do for others what great directors do to me. Grab an audience out of their chairs and make them terrified of going to the beach, or believe in true love or time travel. If I could do that Once, I have achieved my dream.

So? are you an idea person or are you a support? Someone who creates an idea in their head or someone who helps realise it in front of a camera? 

You know you love movies, that is 90% of the work done. You never have to work a job you hate because you're unsure of your passion. 


What are you good at that you want to do alot of professionally and how can that be involved in filmmaking? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Check this trailer out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hYlB38asDY




Note the music and the cuts. Then note the changes in musical tone, the music ends when the action/trauma begins then once that's over the score swells up around 0m50s. Study this trailer for a bit. Notice how the volume changes and you can hear the actor, oftentimes the music remains but very much in the background. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should sit yourself down and think for a hard long while.



This is the only life you're gonna get. No retries, no do overs. What do you want to dive into and commit to for the rest of your life. When you're older and no longer able to work because senility is creeping in you're going to need to KNOW you didn't waste your shot. Don't expect someone to suggest something and you do it because it sounds like fun. It needs to burn inside your chest, fill you with exhilaration just the thought of heading towards that goal. Passion is painful, but it's such a beautiful pain because you know it's what you were meant to do. Why you are here.

<TEXT> (Just my opinion.)


I like the idea. The execution faltered a bit. If you wanna take comedy serious, from what I can tell, you have to be consistent. Always be funny and everyone treats the situation seriously. The main character did well to keep a straight face but the secondary didn't. (Just my opinion.)


I wasn't laughing. The whole time I was waiting for the other shoe to drop but it never did. By the end I was like, oh he's just a dick. That's the joke? (Just my opinion.)

I would've had some comic relief to bring balance to his brashness. Like a fat mentor who can't keep up with perps and tells the intern not to run faster. (Just my opinion.)



I'm not trying to discourage you at all. I would never do that. You frame your shots well and you clearly have a drive to entertain and that's wonderful. Also keep in mind that comedy is the hardest challenge to tackle because it's so subjective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you could do is engineer a memory for yourself. Take a very slow walk around your block, don't create any distractions for yourself and absorb as much as possible. Go back home and write down what you remember, focus on what stuck out to you and ask yourself why that specifically. 

Now remember, films only access sight and sound. It is up to you as a filmmaker to recreate the emotions of memories using only those two senses. Be creative, I challenge you to experiment and come up with something no one else has. 

P.S. don't try to crowbar in other senses with dialogue such as "oh this is delicious" or "it smells wonderful in this park."

P.P.S. Smell-o-vision was a thing, did not catch on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just saw it. The plot could have been a little tighter, the "dad" person James would go into didn't lead anywhere, whereas the "homeless" and "business" persons were not only congruent but also simultaneous. That and the punching sound effect at the beginning.was a bit jarring and took me out for a second. 


Aside from that I was entertained throughout, and I was eager to see how it would end. Fortunately, you guys didn't make the common mistake other filmmakers make where the concept is drawn out and makes you lose interest. In this case, you took a good amount of time to set up your characters and tell your story. Kudos. </TEXT>

2) I've never made a film before, how should I go about funding my first flick?


3) What's a one sheet?


4) For each level of funding, what type of film qualifies? For example, a tiny 20 minute film about jogging. Would that qualify for pre sales?

5) I know I'll sound like a 1800's era gentleman but on the funding side, who do I see about these things?

<TEXT> Chief of staff,Jack Klein rushed into the Oval office. President Warner sat at his desk reading over  the parks appropriations act that had been passed by the house. Jack stood before the President. 
"Jack have you gone over this?"
"Of course, Mr. President."
"What did you think of the Yellowstone oversight comittee."
"Mr. President, I just had aides look over the 600 page bill last night, not a one think you should pass it." 
"And why is that?" 
"It's socialist to begin with, the democratic leadership made it marginally socialist to win political capital come the midterms. They expect you to veto." 
"Which I will?"
"It's either that or the republicans will shun you come 2020, they'll call you the second coming of Vlad Lenin."
"Right, was there something you wanted to talk about?"
"Yes, Mr. President. There's an unidentified flying object sighted just northwest of Oregon by an F-22 raptor part of the 142nd fighter squad out of Portland. I have General Braddock briefing David as we speak."
"What do we think it is?"
"The pilot is still pursuing the object but cannot establish visual contact. Our intelligence notice a spike in Russian activity, so the general consensus is that it's a Russian bomber defecting." 
"Alright, let's go."



The President enters the situation room, it is filled wall to wall with men and women wearing stars and stripes. They stand before him. 

"Have a seat, let's do this."

The Generals sit. Jack sits to the left of the President. 

"Alright, I want to know what you know."

The room is silent. 

"I meant you, General Reynolds."
The general looks at the President, clears his throat.
"Mr. President, two hours ago our pilot spotted an airborne object over Canadian soil, now after interfacing with NORAD we've confirmed that it's not ours."

"And we believe it's Russian?"

"Well considering the size, yes."

"Do we know what kind of plane it is?" 

"Well, we think it's a long range bomber."

President Warner turns to Jack. "Why do they keep saying think and guess?"

"Mr. President we've only detected the object through radar. There's a snowstorm in the area and the pilot of the F-22 has had to keep altitude well above it."

General Reynolds interjects, "Mr. President the pilot says the object is clearing the edge of the storm. I'm putting him on speaker. He's on."

The President looks at the radar on the t.v. across the room, a big blip is steadily in front of the smaller blip in the center. General Reynolds says,"Son you're on in the situation room with the President of the United States."

President Warner leans forward slightly,"Good afternoon son, can you tell me your name?"

"My name is Captain James Bradley. Mr. President it's an honor."

"Captain, what can you tell me about this flying object?" 

"I'm afraid not much, I only picked it up as it was going into the storm a while ago and it's been in there pulling serpentine maneuvers. It seems to be heading towards the edge of the storm now. General Reynolds has advised me to approach at an intercept vector from it's right flank to confirm visibility."

The President nods at General Reynolds. The General says to Captain Bradley," Maintain open radio Captain we're keeping you on. " The General presses the mute button."Thirty seconds until we achieve visibility."

The President looks at the General, "No radio response, yet?"

"None, it could be interference from within the storm."

President Warner turns to Jack Klein and whispers, "Jack."

"Yes, Mr. President? "

"If this goes poorly take us to DEFCON 3."

"Yes, Mr. President."

The General looks at the radar screen. The big blip is now to the top left of the small blip and closing. "FIVE seconds, Mr. President."

"Three."

"One."

The General unmutes the pilot. "Captain Bradley what can you see?"

"ERm, not anything right now. Wait. I see something. It's one fire. Wait I'm picking up a signal. It's NORAD."

An aid hands General Reynolds a phone. The General says," Patch it through." 


"Mayday, mayday. our engine is on fire this is flight 7---"

Captain Bradley comes back on the speaker, "General, can you hear me?"

"I'm here, Captain. Can you tell us what's going on?" 


"It, uh,appears sir to be a single engine Cessna got lost in the storm. Pulling back around to get a better look. I think on ground personnel should get ready for this."

Jack turns to the President. He looks intently at the radar screen. The big blip remains only it's now behind the pilot. The President stands. "Call him out of there."

The pilot on the intercom says,"Sorry, what was that." The line turns to static.

"Get out of there Captain!" 

The radar goes to black. The President bellows, "What the hell happened?"

General Reynolds now wears a bead of sweat, "we lost connection."

"Well get it back, get me something I can look at!" 

A General from the edge of the table swipes at his tablet. "Getting you satellite now, Mr. President." 

The President squints at the end of the table, "Who's that Tambley?"

"Yes, Mr. President." 

"Now then, General Tambley."

A top down satellite image appears on the screen. A massive snow storm frames the left side. In the center are two pillars of black smoke. The image switches to infrared, only two sources of heat, both of them are downed aircraft. From the corner of the screen appears a great, big blue bird, draped in thorns, it flies over the smoke and into the storm.



The room is silent. Every mouth agape. Jack turns to the President. "Mr. President?"

"Do it, Jack. God Help us. Do it."


Jack stands up, "alright Ladies and Gentlemen take us to DEFCON 3, we need to scramble fighters..."

The President sits, beset by terror. Staring on at the screen, now centered on the storm slowly inching towards Seattle.

<TEXT> It'd have to be a new character just as he is being trained, similar to the first game. He assassinates two targets in an attempt to discover where the templars have hidden the holy grail. After the second, the assassins reveal to the main character that they'd been grooming him to become the best assassin, in order to kill the pope (Assassin's creed II), just after killing the pope, the papal vault opens up as it does in the game and we see the precursors appear and when they are about to reveal the location of the holy grail the dna stream desyncronises and desmond wakes up in abstergo to an explosion in the lobby. Security rushes him to the holding cells when they are killed by a female assassin. She shoots out a window, looks out into the street below then at desmond. She says, " I knew your father, I can get you out of here. I need you to trust me." 

"Ok." 

"Just let go into the air like a bird, and remember 'nothing is real, everything is permitted'."

Then you'd begin to wonder how their lives continued after you were gone. You'd create intricate backstories of arguments and vacations, imagine them to the smallest details. Madness consumes you, you are angry but don't understand why, sad but don't understand why. You stare at the faces of strangers,numb, for an eternity. Centuries pass and you cannot quite recognize these people. Then you create a new story with them and how they were once people you loved... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Four years ago, I was stationed 550 miles SE of Bagram Air Base. We'd been doing consistent daytime flyovers of the tribal regions to the east, getting intel back to logistics. 


One day me and crew were flying the C130 on a recon and everything is peachy till we get about half way through return from the AO and we start getting peppered with small arms fire which is strange considering how high up we were. Turns out logistics screwed up and sent us over heavily populated Al Qaeda mountains. So there I am manning my console, trying to do my job and not get shot. RPGs are missing the plane by just a few feet. 



After about five minutes, we make it clear of the enemy fire and I'm able to take a breath. I look at my console and it has a 7.62 right through the middle of it. It's broken. I cal my CO over to take a look at it and he tells me that 7.62 rounds can make 30k feet. No, he said. That there is tree fiddy rounds. And I said tree fiddy? We ain't got no Loch Ness monster in al Qaeda firing no tree fiddy rounds. </TEXT>

Comedians tend to relate to each other and flock to one another, particularly before major success just as a method of survival.

<TEXT> It's very easy to point to a recent movie trailer and say it's one of the greatest of all times. Case in point, The Wolf of Wall Street. I'm asking if you can recall a movie trailer preceeding 2010 that is truly great to look at and garners excitement for that movie.

<TEXT> The Tesla machine that Angier uses for his ultimate trick creates a duplicate of Angier. One remains in place at the machine and another several feet away. My question is if the "real" Angier is at the base of the machine isn't that certain death in regards to the glass tank beneath him? This is assuming that the original Angier is at the base of the machine. If it isn't then the original Angier dies during the first usr of the machine back in Tesla's house. So what was it?  


=calibrating the machine to Copy Angier the base of the machine and teleport the real Angier to a different spot.

=or Angier is fine with dying over and over to best borden


=Or maybe another possibility I haven't thought of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it's been accepted that Wash's death is the most brutal and emotional in the Whedonverse. It really hurt and was done ultimately because Serenity was a last hurrah for Firefly(as was River's rushed character development). However, if we were to get Firefly back, we would want Book and Wash back, even if it meant in a parallel universe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I expected this insight, I know it's kind of a cheat but Firefly itself was cheated and fans would look over this if it meant Wash and Book could come back. It's the writing equivalent of saying,'we're starting over because we didn't get a fair shot the first time.' And quite frankly it seems less sci-fi that we Unkill wash than Firefly coming back (please Netflix).

Joss has said that when he is done with Marvel and Nathan is done with Castle he might revisit the 'verse.


I don't think it's so outlandish to accept a universe tear, even in today's world we are experimenting with particles that could erase everything. I will concede that it's a bit of a coincidence that wash be near the crash site.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent the better part of this afternoon creating plot summaries for 14 episodes of Firefly for a second season. 

I read an Adam Baldwin interview where he said he'd love to return to Firefly but he would want Wash to be unkilled....so I tried to achieve that.

Interested? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Batman's footage is very interesting. He leaps from rooftop to rooftop, when decending upon the criminals of Gotham you can see him systematically pick them off and beat them to a pulp.


However, Tony Starks footage is just more fun to watch, he zooms through the battles and shoots at folks while cracking smart ass comments.


In this respect, the thing to remember is that Batman probably suffers from a mental disorder since he habitually goes out to fight crime and takes no pleasure in doing it. Tony Stark can notice the danger in what he does but will make it fun to watch all the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see how there can be good faith if Ubisoft is willing to lie about a game's visuals in order to build up hype. 

I understand they are trying to garner good faith by doing this but it isn't enough of a gesture, they're just admitting to a lie rather than doing something to satiate the customers. 

   How it come off, to me, is Ubisoft saying "look we're going to give you a product that is of lesser quality than what we promised but because we admitted it you guys shouldn't bitch about it." </TEXT>

<TEXT> You see, the problem isn't so much the game itself, it's the marketing. Ubisoft has a fantastic marketing department that knows how to sell a game and make you believe you are buying more than what you really are but without lying about it. This can potentially become the industry standard if the consumers go out and support Ubisoft. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both very good films IMHO. 


Both loosely deal with trying to fix the past.



Edge of tomorrow is a one-off movie, you go watch it and enjoy it. Take someone with you to talk to about it(not during). It's a bit smarter than a popcorn film. Good performances all throughout.



X-Men DOFP is also a very good movie, but something to take into account is how dense the movie is. This movie doesn't pick up right off of X-3, this is 10-20 years in the future and introduces the sentinel program. If you are ok with turning your brain on and have seen at least 2 X-Men movies then this is a good flick to watch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is important as an actor to convey a real performance.


In this case the director took it upon himself to force a genuine performance out of his performers. A bad director would do this right off the bat without allowing the actors a few takes first but this is a proactive method in my opinion. It shouldn't go too far to the point of abuse, such as Hitchcock on the birds or Kubrick on the shining. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) the bag wasn't a threat to her, the mercenaries were. A bag is just a bag.


2) that rooftop was teeming with hostiles, she was probably finishing them off.


3)true lies, when (this woman) drops the Uzi and it kills all the terrorists. It's funny and I get the point but it still doesn't make sense.

<TEXT> Tom Cruise is a movie star. Other than in movies where his characters name is the title (Jerry McGuire, Jack Reacher) it can be very hard to name his roles. 


An actor is an artist who would prefer you know them by their roles. Kevin Spacey is one such artist. He IS Frank Underwood. Kevin Spacey has made it a habit to stay out of the spotlight in order to better blend into his characters from the audiences' perspective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would prefer a man-woman pairing with the man being jaded and cynical and the woman young and idealistic. An added bonus would be if he's a sexist but really good at his job, kinda like Dr. House. I am personally a bit tired of the rural setting so either a big city or a snowy locale. Both of these places can foster feelings of isolation. I think the villain should be an active serial killer who makes it a point to contact the police. Also, a twist would be nice but not that one of the detectives is the killer (lazy writing).

Edit: also we need more tracking shots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Norman bates wears what would be considered small town casual attire. However, in the climactic scene, it is revealed that he dresses as his mother. He NEEDS to feel her clothes on his skin to become her. In the final scenes the psychologist or detective(look it up) says that now Norma bates has completely taken over. We see him dressed as Norman but talking as his mother. He no longer needs to wear his mother's clothes to be her.


As for Marion, she basically wears the same clothes throughout the 30 minutes she's on film. Any suggestions I make would be far fetched. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Signs. 

For those of you not aware, this movie is heavily criticized for it's lapses in logic and plot redundancies. Folks argue that suspension of disbelief is too difficult to maintain especially considering the "water" issue. However, I can easily look past those issues and simply enjoy, what is, in my opinion, one of Mel Gibson's best performances. His struggle post grieving/ now athiest on top of raising two children is only compounded by these strange lights and their farm's crop circles. You can see the emotion on his face as he is trying to be stable for his family and eventually admits that he doesn't know what to do. Such a strong performance as well as some genuine scares.

<TITLE> Reddit, do you ever find yourself questioning your sanity? </TITLE>

<TEXT> For example: I work Security and have a structured routine everyday. It gets boring, so I tend to set myself on auto-pilot and think of other things. Crazy part: Like any auto-pilot, there are errors. I got into an argument with him for all of his screw-ups. I know he's just in my head, but as security I get bored and find myself talking to myself. I like to think that in my head I look like Bradley Whitford and my auto-pilot looks like Richard Jenkins from Cabin in the woods.


TL,DR: I, very recently, got into an argument with myself.  </TEXT>
