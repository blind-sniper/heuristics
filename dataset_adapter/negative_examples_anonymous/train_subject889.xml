<TEXT> I have come to the conclusion that is getting too big for itself. With it's rise in popularity, it has become a breeding ground for angry people to vent their frustrations on others, for Karma-whores to reap meaningless attention (I guess Facebook likes aren't doing it for them any more) and for spammers to bombard us from a new and invasive angle.

Those who are not part of these groups are left annoyed, disillusioned and cynical. We don't believe any of the sob stories any more, we are sick to detah of shit turning out to be stupid stunts and are just so fed up with trolls and their bile spewing out all over the place.

Honestly, it feels like a small-scale mock-up of how the whole of humanity is slowly sinking into chaos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh. OK, so my old work has an online service for all our payslips and tax documents....but I no longer work there, so I no longer have any kind of access to previous years' tax stuff or any of my slips. 

My old work also have my old address and when they sent this years statement in the mail, despite a mail redirecting service I have in place, the letter got lost. So, I called them up to get a new one. They tell me I need to change my address with them by filling out a Change of Address Form....which they are able to email to me. I ask them why they can't just email me my group certificate. They tell me that is against their security policy. Ugh.

I ask them, if I fill in this form, will you process it quickly? No, there are lots of people trying to change their address and you will go to the back of the line.

I am more than annoyed. They have an electronic copy of my group certificate, which they refuse to send to me. I have to fill out a change of address for so they can mail it to me. They *email* me the form, and I am able to email it back, but even when I do, it will still take weeks for them to even process it!!!

And, after they process the form it will still take another week for them to send me my tax certificate...and then I have to wait another few weeks after for the Tax Office to process my return! 

In this day and age, why everything isn't electronic is beyond me!

I am just so mad at the bureacracy of it all!

<TEXT> When this happens to me, I make up elaborate stories in my head. Like, I am some sortof hero who saves people, or a victim of a crime and I have to make up the clues and then solve them myself. Usually I get so fosused on that my brain stops dwelling on other stuff, gets bored and falls asleep.

This came in handy for me the other day. My brain decided that 1am was the perfect time to start stressing about this really ridiculous family problem we have at the moment. My dad's nephew is being really abusive to my dad because my dad has some money he owes him and his sister. THeir father used to live with us, but passed away leaving all his belongings at ours. My dad has told his newphew "I have your money, you and your sister just need to come get it. When you are here we can go through your dad's stuff and sort it al out." But they don't like eachother and refuse to come over. So, my dad buried the money in the backyard until they come over. My brain decided to begin stressing about this at 1am, because it came up with the horrible thought that if my dad died, no on would know where the money is, and it is about $50k, so it is fairly important.

Anyway, this probably doesn't help you at all but I can sympathise a least! </TEXT>

I am in Australia. I work in a lab, but we have a lot of staff and everyone gets their own computer, so I often find myself just sitting around Googling things. It is kinda cool, but a bit boring.

Mine was apple, carrot, spinach and ginger. It was a greeny brown and I put waaay too much ginger in it. Plus is was super chunky and I couldn't bring myself to chew it so I tried swallowing it and now it is just sitting in my stomach like a lead weight. Blergh.

My favourite recipe so far has been banana, vanilla yogurt, protein powder, honey, cinnamon, a cube of frozen lemon juice and almond milk. It tastes like breakfast! Really yummy and very filling </TEXT>

<TEXT> My housemate would never wash his dishes. I would always end up having to do them.

One day, we had some people over and having refused to do his dishes the night before, I also refused to cook that day. He did the cooking, no fuss and all seemed well. UNtil I looked down at the lamb cutlet I was eating and noticed a fly. A charred, well-cooked fly. THen I noticed another....and another.

I ran into the kitchen and looked into the frying pan with horror to see a whole meal of dead crispy flies in the pan.

He had used a dirty, fly covered pan to cook our meat. 

Unfortunately for him, it was only he and I who were eating the lamb cutlets. WHile I discreetly disposed of mine, I allowed him to eat all of his before showing him the pan. Needless to say, he washed his dishes from that point on. </TEXT>

When I read Harry Potter...even after all these years, I feel like I am returning to the exploits of old friends. I laugh, I cry, I cheer because I feel so connected with them.

ASOIAF is great and well written but I just don't feel as strongly for the characters. It's like reading a gripping account of history. I need to methodically get through it, even if it is just to have a sense of knowing what is happening...knowing but not feeling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I learn craft hobbies, like crochet and drawing. Creating something feels like a good use of my time, because then it doens't feel wasted.
To make friends I turned to Reddit. CatchUps are the best.

Other then that I just think about all the things I have always said "I should do that one day" and make moves to achieve them...however slowly. I will take a class or two in some random thing. It doesn't matter if I don't carry on, at least I tried. I go and explore places that I always see form afar and always think I want to have a closer look at. I also bake and bring the results to people at work. I walk around the shops or open malls, not really looking for anything, and strike up conversations with people. I have met the nicest people on the train who noticed I was crocheting and wanted to talk about it.

The way I figure it, time isn't wasted if you can say "well...I did *this* today. It can be small and just the one thing, but it feels good </TEXT>

<TEXT> The HP series was for the child in us. It fed our imagination, helped us come to terms with complex things like love, and sacrifice and death. We grew with the books, and every time a new one came out it was like you were growing older with them. By the time the last one came out I was not much older than Harry. I felt like his friend and *needed* to know he was OK, because then, whatever I was dealing with or thinking about at the time would turn out OK.

ASOIAF is for us as adults. It satifies our lusts. Blood, sex and violence. We get involved in the politics and the characters because they are complex and interesting....but also otherworldly. We might have some things in common with the characters, but int he end we are enjoying reading about things that we can't relate to. Kings and Queens and war and betrayals. GRRM isn't helping us grow, he is letting us peek into a world of his own. A world that we have grown up seperately from, and one that we want more of because we don't know it.

We grew up with Harry Potter, but we live as adults with the people of Westeros.

...well that is how I see it anyway </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in Medical Science, and in my experience it is a mostly female field. I have only ever had female bosses/supervisors. There are males and they are in vary degrees on senority, but the percentage is probably 30M:70F.

Because of that, I have never experienced any gender-related obstacles. My old work had a small team, so pregnancy was a thing that disrupted us quite a bit. But that never stopped anyone from having babies. It just meant that when someone got pregnant we knew our boss would be stressed out.

My new job is much better in that regard. Big team, so pregnancies are no big deal.

Aside from pregnancies I have not once came to a point where being female has stopped me achieving anything beyond some heavily lifting. I am not talked down to by any of my male collegues or made to feel inadequate.

<TEXT> The article singles out this being a means to stop the protestors taking photos of the women and splashing them all over social media to shame them. In my books that qualifies as harrassment. 

Like I said, they aren't making protests illegal, they are just making the areas around abortion clinics safer. They have every right to protest down the street </TEXT>

They don't talk about the soft kisses their SO plants on their neck, or the cute notes they leave for eachother, or the way they fall asleep holding hands, or the strength they give eachother in hard times, or the happiness they enjoy simply by having someone love them back...because those things are sacred and secret and don't need to be aired.

<TEXT> My Foxi Russell has a toy snake that she deliberately whips around in the air til it is draped across her back. She then trots around the house pretending it isn't there until some sort of internal switch flips and she then enters into a dramatic struggle with it like it is trying to get her. She usually ends up on her back, like she is pretending the snake is winning, then suddenly finishes the game by hurling the snake through the air to the other side of the room. Triumphant, she trots over to me and expects love and praise for defeating the deadly snake that invaded our home.


...and then she spots it again and the battle begins anew

<TEXT> I guess this place can be just full of so much crap, it is hard not to turn off the crapfilter sometimes.

On top of this picture being a hella old repost, the man is publically shaming his daughter for a very normal girly thing...she wants to wear cute shorts like all her friends wear. This isn't something for a man to go around embarrassing his daughter over. So excuse me if I am not singing this father's praises. 
On top of that, the "Father of the Year" phrase *has* been a bit overworked lately, and for things (like I pointed out) are actually a little mundane. I may be a downer when I point this out, but I guess I am just not that easily impressed.

The second point you made is a little beyond what I was being critical of. That sounds like someone with an agenda scrambling to find a way to squeeze their gripes into the conversation. At least mine was in context.

And the last one...how many times have you seen sob story posts that turn out to be bullshit? We are jaded from all the lies. Can't help it.

Edit: I think you are overreacting a little about the "mass downvote" bit, but I think the reason you aren't getting agreement is because you came off really negative yourself. So what if one person disagrees with a post...they have every right to do that. Just because you don't agree with *them* doesn't mean they are wrong or the post is ruined or the world is falling apart. The world needs the Happy Harrys as much as the Debbie Downers. Keeps things grounded. Don't agree with them? No problem, you don't have to. 
Also, looking at the world with a glass-half-empty attitude isn't the sign of a bitter person, and it certainly shouldn't mean that they should just leave Reddit. It just means they aren't easily impressed and thus are more selective with things they do like </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I think dressing yourself and your kid up and going out in public isn't really something to warrant so much praise. Sure it's cute, but it doesn't make anyone the World's Best Parent. If I had a kid and my husband dressed up with him and got unending praise, I'd be a bit bothered because it's not really a great sacrifice to do that.

And I know this may just seem like I am trying contradict you but I fully intend to be that type of mum. Mostly because I will get fun out it too. But I would hate for people to think that *that* makes me a MOTY </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was serving in Afghanistan at the time and we had a holiday in Italy organised during his leave. He bought the ring over the internet (through a reputable site) and had it mailed to his mum. His mum opened the package when it arrived to check that it was all good. She then repackaged it, popped on a different name and sent it to me. 

He told me to expect a package and it was for a friend serving with him. It was somehing he needed over there and he couldn't get it sent over any other way. This was a pretty normal thing as a lot of his army friends lived on Base and hated getig things sent there, so they used our address.

 Anyway, I was going to pop the package in my luggage, but he very non-chalantly suggested I put it in my carry on, just in case. 

When I got to Rome, after our reunion, I gave him the package and he casually tucked it into his bag. Throughout the rest of the trip he kept putting the package in plain sight, making it seem unopened...but he had taken the ring out and hidden it. 

We went on a cruise and he was coy about me using the safe, always making me guess the combinations...which I never could. 

And, as we went from port to port he always asked me if I was having fun that day, trying to pick the perfect day. Malta was definitely one of the best days and it was made better after he popped the question in a beautiful garden overlooking the bay near Valletta.


And the rest, they say, is history.

Edit: He didn't count on me checking his mail for him. I saw the credit card statement a week before I left </TEXT>

On Saturday I went to a market and ate brunch with a friend, then went and got a massage and bought a pot so I could transplant all the gorgeous daffodils blooming in my yard into it. Sunday, my husband and I sat in our PJs all day playing Pokemon together, got KFC for lunch and hen walked the dogs.

<TEXT> If you actually challenged a 7 yo with the topic of inequality you would be surprised with what they think. 

My niece asked my sister a little while ago "why those two men were kissing". My sister told her because they loved eachother. She was ok with that.

Fast forward a few weeks when the SCOTUS ruling came out and she asked me what all the rainbows were in my Facebook. I explained that some people don't like it when two men or two women kiss and want to stop them getting married. The rainbows are put there to show that we don't want to stop them getting married.

She asked me, without prompting, why they can't get married and I told her that because people don't agree with it and don't think they should.

"But they aren't doing anything wrong! They love eachother and people in love get married!"

Even 7 year olds can understand the basics of equality. Give them a little credit. </TEXT>

The black forest and dark chocolate ones are also very good because dark chocolate just works with the biscuit.

The white I am not fond of.

But overall, I just can't go past original. Bite both ends a little to expose the biscuit then shove one end in a hot chocolate and suck on it like a straw. Heaven! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, coming from QLD, the weather ain't so bad.

Sure, winter is cold and a little wet but summer is gorgeous! Mild, dry days and warm nights with sunlight stretching to 9pm.

QLD winters are chilly, like a Melbourne Spring but Summers SUCK! Hot, sticky days where the only relief is a summer storm that has a large chance of just fucking your shit up! And when it rains down here, it rains a little then it gets bored and leaves. In  QLD it rains for *days* and *days* you can't escape the hot dampness of it and just when you think it can't rain any more...it rains some more and then floods fuck your shit up!

10/10 would move to Melbourne again </TEXT>

After having him for only 1 day I quickly found that my yard had a big design flaw that he exploited easily, and escaped from. So, I had to go to the shops to buy a some items to fix it...but I couldn't leave him home alone or he would just escape. So my only obvious choice was to take him along.

 After walking around the centre for a little bit, I quickly realised that every man, woman and child was going to stop me every 10metres to squee at my puppy, so I safely showed him in my big tote bag, bundled up in my jumper, where he promptly fell asleep. 

Jump ahead to me exiting a store without making a purchase and the attendant stopping me to check my bag (regular thing, he wasn't suspicious). I didn't really know what to say so I just nodded and opened the bag revealing my tiny, sleeping puppy.

The man paused, took a moment to comprehend what he was seeing, and then asked if that was a puppy in my bag. I said yes, he let out a little squee and then let me leave.

Moral of the story is, if you want to commit petty theft, bring a puppy along. It will distract security from the stolen items hiding in your pockets.

<TEXT> First, Pats tickets. My husband is a MASSIVE Pats fan and he is desperate to go to the Pats vs Jets game on the 25th. Are we dreaming, or can we easily get some tix?

Second, if we had a spare day-and-a-half, are we mad to try and duck out to Niagara and see the Falls? They are on my list but we only have a small window. I know the drive is a long one but what about a train?

Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband was at the Dept of Transport (aka DMV) one day when a car pulled into the carpark, swung into a spot and just kept going. The car hit the concrete barrier, went over it and got jammed up on it. The wheels were off the ground, but the driver still chucked it in reverse and floored it. Funnily enough, nothing happened. The guy got out of his car and husband said he was the tiniest, most feeble old man he had ever seen. He stood there scratching his head for a moment then went inside for help.

It turns out he was there for a renewal.

My husband didn't stick around long enough to see if the guy got it. He valued his life too much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did an art project a lot like this in high school. The topic was Power, so I made a male torso out of metal, wood and clay, a female torso made of tissue paper and lace, and a cross. I made a box with a padlock and put it in the male's chest and hung the key around the cross. Inside the box was a bunch of stuff meant to symbolise the strength of women (pictures, quotes, etc).

It was meant to symbolise that men seemed to have power over women, but only through the power of the church.

I was so proud of my sculpture but my art teacher claimed he didn't "get it" and never even bothered opening the box or trying to understand. I got a C+.

He was Catholic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sister has 3 kids and 3 step kids, aged 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 so visits to her house are....noisy. Everyone either hates eachother and won't shut up or love eachother and won't calm down. I was lucky to just be on holiday with the youngest this week. I don't think I would have survived the hoarde.

But she was pretty vocal alone. Any question you asked her was answered with "No" until she realised what you were asking...and then it was a little whinge for not getting the thing she just said No to </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I was not aware of those stats. In our news lately, there has been massive coverage of particularly violent domestic abuse cases (a handful of women have died recently). New measures, task groups, charities and workplace allowances seem to be springing up every day to help. To help *women* escaping their abusive *male* partners. I have not once heard mention of a female being an abuser until this article, which is why it struck me as uncommon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to come into work last night, after working 8 hours, to work for another 10 hours. By the time I got home I had been awake for 27 hours. And the work I do, if you screw up...you could kill someone.

So excuse me if I don't shed a tear for you retail workers who have to work 10 minutes over time because someone needed toilet paper real quick. 

Edit: Of course I get paid well for my time. I work hard in uni, worked hard to get where I am and worked hard to get good pay for overtime. I also worked retail when was young. It was easy but I complained about it because I didn't understand what a difficult job was. I was just trying to point out that if a retail job making you stay back 10 mins is the worst thing in the world for you, no matter the pay, then maybe you aren't cut out for a more stressful job </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what about the people with prams that are really easy to set up? Or people who take the spot when the rest of the carpark is available? Or if they decide not use the pram and instead just decide to carry the baby? Or what about all the mothers who take up all the spots leaving other mothers in the lurch?

The point I am trying to make is unless there are clear rules, enforced and punishable you don't have to do shit. The world doesn't owe you anything because you have a pram.

It's nice to take another spot if you find one, but I sure as shit am not going to drive around for 1/2 an hour and then park on the street because some parent might show up and want it.

It just seems that it would be harder to claim that they were definitely going to donate the money unless it was in writing. Feels like he said, she said.

Who knows what kind of debt her illness left him with. What if he relied on her income? She might not have had health insurance. 
So the money was for treatment...now it'll be for the funeral costs, medical expenses and helping this dude actually move on with his broken life. 

If there was fine print to all those peoples' generosity and he has broken that, then fine....but personally you would have to be heartless to ask for him to give it up </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hindsight, of course, teaches us many things, especially the consequences of bad decisions. But the point I was trying to make (and other people in the thread) is that it should have been clear to her that Sydney Road is way too busy to use a child's trailer on. I didn't call her a bad parent and I didn't say she deserved it, I just said it was a fair statement to make. 

Of course, saying that she shouldn't have been on Sydney Rd doesn't help her now, but it is what people are thinking. Maybe if she was thinking to do it again, or someone else, the reaction here might convince them to reconsider that choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because if I do something unsafe in a place where unsafe things can lead to accidents, then I must take some of the blame.

But I do something safe, such as wear a miniskirt and some douche decides to rape me on purpose, then I cannot be blamed.

A rape victim can't change her actions to disuade a rapist...rapists gonna rape. She can't be blamed because he is a horrible POS.

Do you see women in dark alleys and think to yourself "What a stupid woman walking around here...I might rape her"?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can I clarify that I never initially meant this to be about the bank account of the car owner. As my title suggests, I was merely referring to the *power* of the car and expressing my feeling that a Learner probably shouldn't be at the wheel of something with so much oompf.

I am perfectly aware that rich kids need to learn and their parents' car is usually the most available car. I am not specifically attacking the wealthy. If this were a turbo skyline or a massive V8 I would have the same qualms. I feel that driving a car with power should come later in life, not when you are still learning.

I am not sure where this "exploiting labour'' comment came from either. I never once wrote that

<TEXT> When pregnant with her 3rd, my sister just woke up in the middle of the night and thought "hmm...I think I am in labour." Not wanting to push her luck because her 2nd only took 2 hours they bundled into the car and drove to the hospital (20min drive). She walked up to the counter and told the nurse she was in labour. The nurse, of course, saw no reason to hurry and actually told her to go home. My sister persisted, so they started to walk her down to the birthing suite. After 5 or so steps her waters broke and 7 minutes later my neice was born.

It all happened so quickly my BIL almost missed it. I can only hope I have it that easy when I have bebbehs </TEXT>

It was never finished. It just cuts off after a little paragraph about how swearing is for dumb bunnies. She must have died before being able to finish it.

<TEXT> I am going to assume that you have not experienced any of the type of catcalling I am referring to.

That single occasion wasn't the only time I have experienced something like that. I have been called a slut because I didn't respond to one man. I have been told I am ugly anyway because I didn't respond to another. 

So excuse me if I make a few assumptions about men who call out to women on the street. They aren't all out to rape me, but even if it is just a wolfwhistle, it is very clear that they just don't understand how stressed out it can make women feel. What if that simple appreciate wolfwhistle I ignore is just the prelude to something more horrible? I stick by my saying "most men" because if you are a man, you would have little idea of what it is like to have strangers ogle you, call out to you, or whistle at you since you were 13 years old almost *every* time you walk down the street. I have spoken to people about this and it is common for men I speak to about it to brush it off, calling it a compliment. I did not say most men DO call out, and I did not say most men threaten to rape me, I said most men think the mild forms of catcalling are OK. If this generalisation offends you then...well that's not my problem.

On top of this, I really don't appreciate you telling me "I hope you don't have sons". I probably will have sons and I will certainly make a point of teaching them what behaviours I feel are unacceptable, which I feel includes any kind of public singling-out of women based purely on their looks.

For the record, I never once went on about "the patriarchy, the patriarchy", "rape culture" or "male privilege". I simply shared my personal experiences. They aren't wrong and you can try all you like to dismiss them, but I will use them to teach my children what is acceptable and what is not. If you think that will mess them up, then I don't want to think about what you will teach yours </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great read.

Time and time again it just floors me that most men think it is OK to shout things at women, even if they have a wife, gf, sister or daughter.

I was getting catcalls early in my teens because of my big chest, even when I was in school uniform. At first I was flattered, then annoyed, then eventually I found out what happened if I ignored these men...I was threatened.

Once, I was walking home from uni and was catcalled by a neighbor down the street. I ignored him...so he threatened to rape me.

What. The. Fuck?

I had to change my walking pattern home. I usually walked through a park with little lighting because it saved me 15mins...but I had to change that because some fat wank didn't get his ego stroked when I ignored his caveman-like advances.

It makes me sick, and I hope to one day have sons and show them just how horrifying this behaviour is. Maybe change will come eventually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One time, sitting out the front of my house in rural Queensland Australia, I was absentmindedly staring at the trees across my yard when suddenly, one of the branches moved.

For some stupid reason my brain instantly decided there was a monkey in our tree, but then I remembered I was in Australia, so it changed and decided it was our cat.

We don't have a cat.

It took one more moment, during which my brain contemplated the possibility of ninjas in our tree before the branch moved again and I realised I was looking at one of [these]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Tawny-frogmouth.jpg).

<TEXT> A comment I wrote a while ago to another post:


One day, my husband and I were out the front of our house when a little streak of white came out of nowhere and disappeared under our car. After a little bit of coaxing and calling, I pulled out the smallest, most frightened ball of fluff ever. Poor little pup was shaking so bad. He didn't have a collar on, and he was so cute and frightened I instantly decided that he was mine. My husband, however, was more practical and insisted I take him to a vet to check for a chip. Reluctantly, I did, and unfortunately there was a chip. It was registered to an address right around the corner from ours.

With a heavy heart and an armful of wiggly, fluffy puppy I went home and then set off down the street. As I turned the corner I saw a girl in her mid teens sitting out the front of her house, crying. As I walked up she looked at me and then her face lit up with the most joyous smile. With no hesitation I handed back the fluffball and the girl burst out with tears of joy.

Man, I wish I could have kept that puppy, but no amount of tiny puppy kisses were worth having to see a heartbroken girl mourning the loss of her new friend. 

TLDR, found puppy, found microchip, found joy in returning it to its owner


Edit: I am going to be one of those people who say "Holy cow! My first gold!" Thankyou anonymous stranger for popping my gold cherry! </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Life and Death of an Amigarumi Elephant </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-20 23:22:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Earlier in the year I made an elephant for my newborn nephew. He was hands down the best amigarumi I had ever done: http://imgur.com/a/Sz1zZ.

My Sister in Law and her husband loved him and they were sure that as he grew up, my nephew would love him too.

However, my nephew was not a healthy baby. He was born with a very rare congenital bowel defect and was whisked off to intensive care the moment he was born. A few days after he came into the world, my husband and I met our newest family member and I was so excited to give him his little elephant. His mother gave him pride-of-place in my nephew's crib, nestled amongst the tubes and monitor wires near his tiny head.

It was such a bittersweet sight, seeing my tiny nephew railing himself against the defect he was born with whilst cuddling with a toy that I made so lovingly for him.

Unfortunately, like many stories, this one turned more bitter than sweet in the end.

After a heroic 6 week long struggle for life, my nephew passed away. His parents were with him...and so was his elephant. 

The funeral was heartbreaking. My nephew's coffin was so tiny, and looked even smaller in my brother-in-laws arms as he carried it into the chapel. I almost couldn't bear it...until my sister in law told me not to worry, because his elephant was in there with him. 

He loved his elephant, she told me, and he will be taking it with him into the next world. She asked if I was ok with that, and through my tears I was able to tell her that nothing would cheer me up more than knowing he wasn't alone in there. I made that elephant for him, no matter what.

My nephew was cremated the next day with his little elephant by his side. Although we are all now left with a gaping hole in our lives, I have at least found comfort in knowing that our special little fighter had something soft and loving with him til the end.


Sorry for the feel trip guys, but I just wanted to share this story with people I knew would appreciate it and understand.


Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. The pain of losing him hasn't lessened over time, but I am getting better at handling it. Bonus pic of my nephew telling us all to live with peace in our hearts: http://imgur.com/fsDnE65 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given the choice, I would rather not watch football, talk about fishing or play Xbox. But my husband enjoys those things, so I got involved with them too
 I picked a football team to follow, I got a fishing rod of my own and I learnt how to play COD. I do those things so I could spend time with him while doing them. I understand that this isn't realistic for all couples, but I just feel like if a partner has to lie or decieve the other one in order to find the time to do something they enjoy then there is a problem.

If I found out my husband was doing something like this (I am making the assumption that the wife knows nothing here) I would be disappointed in myself for being the type of wife that needs to be lied to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just moved to Melbourne recently and I get the vibe that Flinder's St Station is seen as a major icon of the city, but to me it just isn't at the standard I expected. If it looked like that proposed design, it would be a splendid icon. It would be awesome and people would probably see it in the same light at the Opera House and flock to see it.

That being said, I would really rather not have to have a system where every now and then it takes me 3 hours to get home.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey I totally agree...it sucks. But mine was actually a health issue. I was constantly getting painful, somwtimes infected ingrown hairs. I tried EVERY trick in the book: shaving, waxing, trimming, oils, creams, oitments with no relief.

It was also a source of constant embarrassment for me, so me paying that much money was 100% worth it. It has given me so much confidence. I can actually wear a bikini now!!!

I would also like to point out that laser is permanent. i will never have to wax agaim. That is $40 month for the rest of my life saved right there </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw results after 1 session. I am now 3 sessions in and i have gone from shaving once a day and still having stubble to shaving once a week IF I remember. The hair is now light and wispy. 

I was one of those people who was a perfect candidate: dark hair, light skin, quick growing hair, so my results were bound to be good. 

I also got my bikini done which was the same story of coarse, dark hair and sensitive skin. I hadn't worn a bikini without boardshorts EVER but now, I am so happy to strut it.

All up I paid $740 for a years worth of treatment for both under arm and bikini, and with it only halfway done I am already feeling like it was worth every penny </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this is probably not the kind of answer you are looking for, but I had terrible problems with shaving under my arms. My skin got so irritated, it got really pigmented and scarred.

So I got lazer hair removal and it is hands down the best decision I ever made. I am 6 months in, my skin is smooth, healing and I am no longer ashamed of lifting my arms in public.

100% recommend it! 

Plus, the price may seem steep at first but there are groupons available, payment plans, ete </TEXT>

I worked in a lab that helped Frazer out with his work. He (or his team) were sloppy at labelling samples and it was my job to go through our liquid nitrogen storage tank and toss out the 20+ year old samples of his that were inappropriately labelled.

Somehow I felt like I was destroying a part of history...but he was never coming back for them, so it had to be done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest I am not totally certain of cancer risks. I think it does all the depend on the cancer and if they are due to external or genetic risk factors.

Also, once you go through the first blood test you will go through a few more rounds of testing. You have to be crossmatched against the recipient a few times, and have confirmatory testing done too. We like to make sure we are 100% sure before ripping your organs out :P

As for the surgery itself, sorry I can't speak for that part...i am just a scientist

<TEXT> I work in the lab that handles only the Histocompatibility, which we determine from blood. 

Each person has a "Tissue Type" which they inherit from their parents. That refers to a cluster of molecules called the Major Histocompatibility Complex. Essentially, these molecules help the body's immune system determine self from non-self. When you are being tested for compatibility, you are being tested to see what MHC molecules you have and whether they are the same as the recipient.

Now, in Solid organ donation, your Tissue Type is not the most important thing. You can still donate if you are not a match. Is it the case that just being the right blood group can mean you could donate. To explain this simply, the recipient is going to be on immunosupressants, that the body can't really recognise self from not self anyway.

That being said, doctors will try to match you as best as possible. Because a good matched organ is leas likely to cause the recipient to develop antibodies.

When your body is challenged with something foreign, it can develop antibodies against it, which will attack that thing the next time it enters your body.

Kidney recipients are usually very sick. They gets lots of transfusions. Transfusing blood challenges that person with something foreign, and they develop antibodies. Not all of these antibodies matter to us at Histocompatibility. We only care if they are antibodies that would specifically attack the organ we are trying to put in. We call those Donor Specific Antibodies. 

A recipient with no antibodies at all (unsensitised) would have a MUCH better chance than a person who has lots and lots of antibodies (sensitised) and if that person has lots and lots of DSAs, matching can be almost impossible.

For that reason and for those people, Typing becomes very important.

A sensitised patient could have so many DSAs that only 5% of the population would have a Typing that could "slip through the gaps" and be both compatible and not under the DSA umbrella. 

Once you take into account size, donor health, waiting time, etc a person could find themselves waiting a very very long time for that 1 in 10 person to match them.

Edit: I am on mobile so sorry if this is a bit garbled </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My newborn nephew is in the Royal Children's Hospital, a month after being born with a rare bowel defect. His parents have just been told to expect their tiny fighter to remain there for 6-12 months. My heart is breaking for them, and I want to do something to support them, but don't know how.

Does anyone know which charities are best to help parents in this situation? They live local to the hospital, so accomodation isn't the issue. I just worry for their mental and emotional states and want to find someone who can help me make their lives a little easier.

Thanks </TEXT>

It showed a complete lack of respect for my feelings. It felt dismissive; as if any problem I had with him was only because I was full of hormones and thus not worth his time. I told him how very hurtful it was but he says he doesn't regret it.

<TITLE> Anyone want to have a crochet circle this Sunday? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-16 07:54:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> New to Melbourne, I recently had to give up my regular Stitch 'n Bitch crochet circle...so I am looking to make a new one!

I am thinking that a city park would be a great meet-point as it will be a sunny 28 on Sunday. I will be temporarily at Camberwell (usually in Croydon) but don't really know the area, so I am open to suggestions. If we were to make it a regular thing, we would need to decide on a more permanent spot.

So is anyone keen? I don't mind if you are a bare beginner, as I have taught a few of my friends before. I am just looking to enjoy the great company of fellow hookers :P

Me: 25 f, Scientist, crocheting for 2 years


1:30pm Fitzroy Gardens. Bring blanket, tools and snacks if you want. We will meet at the south east corner and find a spot from there :)

Edit: Look for the girl on the blue blanket! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just moved to Victoria from Queensland, and bought a house out at Croydon. In the meantime, I am staying with family at Ringwood.

Locals keep suggesting that Ringwood and Croydon are unsavory areas, which confuses me, as they seem lovely.

I am starting to think these people don't have a good grasp on what mkes somewhere truly scummy. 

These people need to go on up to QLD; spend some time at Sunshine, Caboolture or Nambour stations THEN talk to me about scum.

Am I wrong here? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday we arrived after driving all the way from Brissy. 

I am exhausted now, but once I am feeling human again I will want to start enjoying this fab city. Currently, I am based in Ringwood, but will move soon with plans to buy in the same area.

If anyone has any general advice, offers of friendship or suggestions of cool places, I'd love to hear them! I need some friends, a gym, a hobby, sports, all the stuff I left behind.

I am a 24, female Medical Scientist. I love books, bike rides, fashion, tasty sweets, netball and crochet. I am chatty and energetic, love going shopping, and am always good for a conversation. 

Has anyone got a casual netball team they need players for?

Or a crochet circle that needs another hooker?

Can't wait to start enjoying my new home! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know most people I talk to say that everything is different once you have your own kids, but I want to see if there are any ladies for whom this did not happen.

I just am starting to think about having kids soon but worry about my almost complete disinterest in almost every child I meet. I love my neices enough to spend large amounts of time with them, but they are the only exception and I am usually very relieved to return them to their mum afterwards.

I know women are meant to be all maternal and stuff, but I just worry that I haven't got what it takes. 

Has anyone else been in this situation but had kids anyway? Did it change?

Sorry, if this is the wrong place to ask this. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was in a hardware store the other day, looking for some timber for a project.
A little old man was in the same aisle, shuffling along while I looked over my choices, making sure they were straight.

As he came past me he leant in and said "You must be a carpenter, you look like you know what you are doing!"

I laughed and told him I wasn't but did know what I was doing.

At first I wondered the implications of what he said: That I must only know what I was doing if I was a carpenter. Why couldn't I not do carpentry as a trade and still know what I was doing?

But then I realised how uncommon it was for an elder man to make the assumption that I was a carpenter. Usually I would expect the assumption that my husband was one and I was running errands for him. He saw me as a strong, independant woman capable of doing a trade for a living.

It is something small and inconsequential, but it made me smile. I appreciated him for seeing me as woman, not a wife/girlfriend, and one who was perfectly capable of doing a "man's trade". </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tinnitus has been constant for a year or two, but now I am hearing phantom sounds. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Docs.

About a year or two ago I suddenly developed tinnitus. I was lying down in bed one night and my ears were roaring like I had just been to a concert. It was sudden, with my night before being normal and quiet. No injury or event happened that day as far as I can recall.

And it never went away.

Every night my ears roar and it makes it difficult to sleep because the world isn't silent.

During the day I get sporadic bursts of ringing/deafness in one ear. Sometimes it is so high pitched it causes me pain.

But lately something has changed. I hear noises that aren't there. It is most apparent when I am at work, late at night on a Call In and no one else is around.

I hear phones ringing, footsteps, doors closing and the distinctive tinkle of a bell that one lady likes to wear on her keys.

I brought it up at work once and everyone looked at me like I was crazy. I thought it was just my brain filling in the silence and figured it was normal.

So, is it normal? Do I reason to be concerned?

<TITLE> She slapped me on the arse! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-18 15:36:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so I was playing social netball tonight and we were losing. Normally, I don't care a whole lot about the score because I am in it for the fitness but tonight, it was bothering me. I was getting frustrated that the ref was making a lot of petty calls against our team and ignoring them when the other team did the same thing. On top of this, their centre was constantly getting in my girls' faces and contacting them subtly so the stupid ref couldn't see.

I got sick of it, so I started sticking to her like glue. Wherever she went, I was on her. She started getting irate. Then, when I had my back to her trying to block her, she bumped against me to obviously draw a foul against me. Ref didn't see, so I bumped back.

She responded by slapping me *hard* on the arse!

I was like "wtf did you just slap me on the butt?!"

She denied it, of course. I pressed and said she did. Then she said it was an accident. The ref took her side and said it was just a general contact; part of the play. 

I spun on him and said "I know what a fucking slap on the arse feels like!"

 He threatened to send me off the court, to which I said "fine, if she goes!"

She wouldn't go and wouldn't admit anything. I called her out on her physical playing and she just stared. The ref was weak and once I showed him I wasn't getting off the court he just told the girl to apologise...which she wouldn't.

The whole situation ended with me just telling them to continue playing. The ref, the idiot, didn't try to resolve the issue and just allowed play to continue.

Later, when I looked at my cheeks, sure enough, there was a big red hand print. 
 
The whole thing made me a lot madder than it should have, but I just couldn't believe she had the nerve to deny it, then to say it was an accident and than have the ref take her side. Like I said, I know when I have been slapped! Don't tell me what I felt!


I know this is petty and juvenile and not worth reading probably, but I just needed to vent and this seemed like the place to do it.

If you read it, thanks and I'm sorry for a probably boring story </TEXT>

It made me so happy to have Scarlett as my namesake. She isn't nice, she isn't selfless...but she is *strong* and determined to have what she wants, and that made me love her. Yes, she was a fool when it came to love, but I guess that is what love does to us. It can make a fool of even the strongest of people.

We play every monday night at Toombul Indoor Centre with games starting between 6:00 - 8:15pm. 

It isn't a high-skill competition and we are all just in it for the exercise. Your skills can be old, rusty or non-existant; we don't mind as long as you have the enthusiasm!

Games are $14 each and that covers court hire, ref hire and sports insurance.

If you are keen, we have a game on monday night at 6pm. No commitment required. Just have a try and see if you like it :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Docs.

For a few years now I was under the impression that I had asthma. A doc in uni diagnosed me even after a few inconclusive tests (normal blood O2, good lung capacity, no lesuons in chest x-ray, no wheezing).

 I do have low stamina for cardio, I get short of breath at times when it really doesn't seem like I should ( laying down for bed, watching TV) and I have had two 'attacks' (both while doing exercise). A puffer helps but I don't feel immediate relief, it usually takes a while.

It has gotten to the point where I am almost always short of breath and have to make an effort to take a good deep breath. I rarely feel satisfied after a yawn and I find myself trying desperately to suck in a little bit more air just to feel like I have enough.

It is really starting to get to me and I have spoken to a GP and he says it is psychological and I am just getting myself worked up which makes it worse. Is he right?

<TEXT> No Spoilers, to be safe.

For my birthday this year, I asked my dad for the Game of Thrones bookset. 

My father is a wonderful man, but has sometimes given me reasons to question his judgement...or at least his thought processes.

 One Christmas I wanted a copy of The Da Vinci Code that had all the pictures of the churches in it (I love Roman architecture). He couldn't find it, so he gave me a book of Da Vinci's writings and drawings.

Close enough.

Another year I asked for a hammock. I told him specifically the one I wanted and where to get it. He got me one completely different and not really what I was hoping for, but it had stripes like the one I pointed out so I just didn't have the heart to fault him on it.

One time, just randomly he bought me a spellbook. I have no idea why, it wasn't my birthday. To this day I have never read it.

Anyway, all of these things have been funny little events that lead to me possessing things I never thought I would, and me appreciating my dad just for the effort he puts in.


But this birthday, I was serious. I wanted that bookset. I needed it. So, I gave my dad very clear instructions. I told him Game of Thrones bookset. It is *this* big, *this* much money and you can buy it from *this* shop.

Noticed my mistake yet?

So my poor dad went off in search of The Game of Thrones bookset. He went to the shop and looked around. He looked and looked and looked. Finally, after what he said was about half an hour he gave up. He headed over to a table in middle of the shop. He picked up a big set of books and took a quick glance at the back. 

Dragons, knights, Queens and intrigue.

"This sounds like something YoureNotaGenius would read, I will get her this seeing as I can't find what she wants." And so he did.

Fast forward to my birthday and as I opened my present I noticed a look of apprehension my dad's face. I shrugged it off and kept opening.

I must have missed the look of confusion he surely would have had afterwards when I jumped up and gave him a hug, crying "Oh dad, it is *perfect*! Just what I wanted. Thank you so much!"

He finally got one right, and that was purely by chance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After seeing a post on Facebook about organ donation, I was appalled by the sheer number of people who felt that older people do not deserve organs because they have already lived their lives. 

I got so mad when these people said things like "that's dumb, why didn't they give the organ to a younger person?"

And while I know not every can know the details of how organs are allocated, it just bothered me that so many people thought so little of the elderly and felt that the young deserved more in life.

Youth really is wasted on the young! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is an X post, forgot to put that in title.

ver the last few years I have felt like my general well-being is in decline. My co-workers call it stress, my friends call it old-age (I'm 24!!!) and my doctor just says it is nothing. However, the more I tally up my issues, the more I think/worry most of them may have a singular cause:

Tinnitus/v. sensitive hearing 

Blurred in one eye, nearsightedness (only recently discovered- never noticed before and not brought up in childhood eye tests)

Headaches/Migraines

Neck pain/severe muscle tension (Go to Chiro, Physio AND Remedial masseuse)

Forgetfulness (short term, things slip away quickly)

Twitches/muscle spasms 

Twitching eye 

Heart palpatations w adrenaline rush

Slightly enlarged optic nerve in right eye

Boughts of vertigo/dizziness/ ground feels like it is moving

Occasional insomnia (who doesn't get this, but i thought I would include it)

Fatigue

Lately, lack of enthusiasm for even fun activities


Bronchial cough

Short of breath

(Diagnosed with Stress-Related asthma. but as I lie here in bed, relaxing, I am short of breath, sooo....?)

I know some of these are general and vague problems that millions of people also deal with. I don't want a wild, obscure internet diagnosis, I just want to know whether, as Doctors, you would find these symptoms cause for concern. If so, I will push my GP to paying closer attention.

Further background: 24yo F Healthy weight, eats well, exercises regularly, normal blood pressure, previously noted 'slightly high' heart rate like I was nervous whilst getting tested (didn't feel nervous), no abnormal blood tests save for a single one with low blood proteins (retest was normal, ?lab error). Medication: The Pill and regular paracetamol for headaches

If it is just stress, what can I do? I take regular Me Time, exercise regularly, don't take work home with me, don't sit and fret on issues. This year I will be moving interstate but that decision is only weeks old and some of these issues have been around for a few years. </TEXT>

Beat that.

<TITLE> Australian travelling to Boston to see the Pats play in October. Are there any special tickets I can buy to surprise my husband with that give a greater experience? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-15 22:38:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My hubby is Pats mad. He has been following them since he was little, despite none of his family having any interest in the game. He just watched them play one day and hasn't stop watching since.

We are travelling to America in October this year and although there are many things on our to-do list, the whole trip will be based around us getting to Boston amd seeing a Pats home game.

Now, hubby will have his bday while we are over there, so I am hoping to find some sort of 'special experience' tickets to surprise him with. I'm thinking VIP box, stadium tour, anything like that. Hell, if I can somehow get him in the same room as Tom Brady, he would probably pass out with joy.

So, can anyone help me? Point me in the direction of a place I can get this? Or even just tell me if it is possible/affordable?

Thanks! </TEXT>

I bought 7 x 50g balls just because they were on sale for $1.20 but now I don't know what to do with it.

It is gorgeously soft and slippery and feels magic against my skin, so I was hoping to make something like a jumper or shawl. But I haven't found any pattern that would work with the glossy, slippery nature of the yarn.

Suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once or twice a week I sit next to a lady on the train who is an avid crocheter, like me. We first spoke when she complimented me on my amugurumi kitty I was working on. Over the weeks we have had great chats, discussing our favourite yarn brands, the best stitches and new patterns we have found. I look forward to my train trips now and enjoy our chats immensely.

This morning, the nice lady delivered on a promise I hadn't really expected her to keep and gave me a bag full of cashmere yarns with the condition that I make another kitty out of it just so she could see how it turned out.

I was very thankful and happy that someone would be so friendly and giving to a complete stranger, without expecting anything in return. 

Crocheters really are the nicest people! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My step brother is interested in signing up for a business opportunity provided by a company called Vemma. The model is based on sales of healthy products supplied by the company as well as membership sign up.

 You have to pay to recieve the product and then your sales numbers and how many people you get to join equate to an income. They aren't talking huge dollars for the most part but it seems a little too easy.

It has been labelled a pyramid scheme, and I am not certain but I can see why it would be called that. [This]( http://yprzone.com/) is their website and [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtSmuX9ID5o feature=youtube_gdata_player) is their video.

Does anyone know anything about them? Have any horror or success stories? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys! I am making a 12x12 granny square quilt. I am 56 squares in and still undecided about how I will join them all together.

I have narrowed it down to two techniques:

The [slip stitch]( http://attic24.typepad.com/weblog/joining-granny-sqaures.html) method

Or the [invisible stitch]( http://doyoumindifiknit.typepad.com/do_you_mind_if_i_knit/2010/02/joining-up-with-an-invisible-stitch.html) method.

So I am wondering if there is anyone out there who has used either/both of these methods who can give me some pros and cons. I dont mind that the slip stich is visible from the back but I do mind if i get unsightly ridges or awkward edges at the front.

[Here]( http://imgur.com/Vx1xfsr) is a pic of my progress :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help for finding uses for a large amount of 12ply yarn. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-25 23:50:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am very new to crocheting and after bravely setting out to make a nice throw using 12ply yarn, I quickly discovered I was out of my depth. My throw started as a scarf, but I found it was too stiff with the 12ply so I carried on widening it, making a throw. 

I went out and bought heaps of the yarn I was using so I didn't run out, thinking I was a genius for stockpiling it.

But halfway through I realised my throw was just as stiff as my scarf...so I unravelled it.

Now, I am stuck with about 5 HUGE balls of purple 12ply yarn and neither the skills nor the knowledge to turn it into something useful.

So can anyone help me out with suggestions for a basic pattern I can use to get rid of all this yarn? Everything I try seems too intricate for it's thickness, or requires various colours when all I have is the purple... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, what she did was hard, no denying that and attention on women's health is usually a good thing. But the media needs to stop glorifying sick celebrities. It portrays them as the benchmarks and 'poster-children' for a disease when, as wealthy and famous individuals with access to almost endless medical resources, they are in the best possible position while sick. 

Common people, like struggling single mothers and embattled pensioners have more reason to be called inspirations than celebrities. 

Furthermore, the media lauding these famous people as inspirations creates unrealistic expectations for normal people coping with the same situations. </TEXT>
