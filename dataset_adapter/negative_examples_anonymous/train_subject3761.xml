<TEXT> The only reason this is such a huge deal is that my parents are out of state for two weeks. My hands are tied. I wish they could look at the records from the last time I got a card (along with my moms signature on my old card!) and give me a new one, but I guess not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a huge TBR list and a very thin wallet, so the library is my buddy. I haven't gone in a while since I've been in a bit of a slump, but I went to the library and the whole system was different. 

I needed a pin to use the computers. I asked what that was about. The librarian scanned my card and looked me up and apparently I wasn't in the system. Okay, maybe it's not scanning correctly? She sends me down to the first floor for a new card. This librarian tells me they don't use those cards anymore and I need a new one. I got that card 10 years ago and my aunt has taken me to another city's library and used her 20 year old card! 

Has this happened to anyone else? This is a minor inconvenience to most, but apparently you have to be 18 to get a library card. I'm 17. I can drive a car and hunt animals but I can't be trusted to get a library card to replace my existing one. 

I know this is a bit more of a rant than book discussion, but I want to share my feelings with some book lovers that would understand the pain of not having a library card.

<TEXT> I definitely finished the book with very negative feelings. I also feel that I read the book at the wrong time in my life, which took away from me fully enjoying the book and being able to look at Holden from an objective viewpoint. 

I also read it for school. Although I disliked it while I read it during the summer, when September came around, along with the teachers analysis, that book got butchered and I ended up liking it less. Maybe I'll give it a second go in a few years.  </TEXT>

That's the easiest way to make that call go. You know the store technically 'received' your app, but you don't know if anyone looked at it. This ensures that a manager will know there's an app waiting and if they're hiring, they'll look. If they're not hiring, they'll let you know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would do Barcelona and Toledo. I toured ~12 cities in Spain, and Madrid was my least favorite. For shopping it's nice, but it's such a bustling metropolitan area it doesn't make a great vacation. 

Barcelona and Toledo are both gorgeous cities. 

Toledo has history and sites and little shops on side streets that are fun to go into and restaurants that you're less likely to find in an urban area. While in Toledo, I also got a gorgeous handmade sword. I don't recommend a sword because customs was an absolute pain, but there's also jewelry and smaller blades that are easier to transport. The views in and of Toledo are breathtaking and great photo spots. 

Barcelona gives the best of both worlds  with metro shopping areas in the same city as amazing sites to see such as the Sagrada Familia (pictures don't do the inside of it justice! Definitely go on a sunny day) and the Parque Gell. The architecture throughout the city is also just amazing. 

I don't entirely hate Madrid. The museums there are amazing, but I would only make Madrid a day trip. The museums don't take too long to tour and there's only so much time you can spend in Parque Retiro. 

Honestly, if you're going to be in Spain for a while, don't limit yourself to a couple cities. Get around for some day trips! The aqueducts in Segovia, the university in Salamanca, and the bull fighting museum in Seville were some of my absolute favorite spots outside of Barcelona and Toledo. 

Sorry for the lengthy post and any spelling errors, but Spain is such and old and amazing country.  </TEXT>

Grey slacks and a white button down was my interview outfit. Professional, but not flashy. Come off friendly, not militant.

<TEXT> Well, the first one is easier to answer. Subway salads are mad with 6 inch portions of meat and footlong portions of veggies. They're actually pretty huge since I usually put enough lettuce to fill the bowl in the cases that people thing olives and lettuce is a salad. 

Other than subway, there's gotta be a variant of southwest at just a regular grocery store. Never scoped it out. But we can't sell packages of it to customers. A week ago a guy came in and asked if he could buy 30 pounds of enchilada. Nope :/  </TEXT>

These customers will be your problem for 5 minutes maximum. Put on your customer service face for those few minutes and remember that the sooner you just deal with them, the sooner they're gone. 

And petty revenge is always a blast. Oh, you wanted mayo? Here's 40 lines right in the hinge. Cut the sub unevenly. Only 6 olives on a footlong. Give them only 1 napkin. Then when they're gone, go in the cooler or freezer and just rant like there's no tomorrow. They're not completely sound proof, but it's better than yelling at customers!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get as many of your duties done ASAP! As a closer, this is super important. 

I think my favorite hack is something that you would need to ask an opener to do. I hate cleaning the metal cambros that catch all the food from the baine. We figured out that the t shirt bags fit nicely in these. When they're nice and clean in the morning, put some of the bags in them. Leave them in all day or change them if needed. Nice and clean. 

Prepping is usually the first thing I get out of the way. When that's done, I know I'll be ready for customers and not have to run in back to prep during the rush. 

After that I take care of helping my precloser. 

The second bread is panned for the next day and frozens are pulled, I start my closing count. It's okay to count everything in back early since nothing is baked after 6 or so. 

Another thing I do is condense and clean the baine an hour before close. I get all of the veggies and important meats onto one side of the baine. I clean the baine and forget about it. It's my least favorite job so I would rather get it out of the way ahead of time. 

Another one of my favorite little hacks is getting other people to do their job completely. It's the Preclosers job to take out garbage. I make sure they take out all the garbage. It's a bit riskier for a closer to leave the store to take out the garbage late at night. At my store we also have a rule about dishes. You need to clear the sinks before your shift ends. I make sure others do that or I get stuck with a huge pile of dishes.

There's probably much more, I love finding ways to make my job easier, but that's all I can think of for now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I picked up the Ulta brush and sponge cleanser and tonight I tried it out. The first think I cleaned was my beauty blender. I've been washing it before with just some foaming Dial soap. So I get it soaked and spritz some of the cleanser on. I start lathering it in and pink starts splashing on the sink! I panic and rinse my beauty blender and the water started running pink! 

My beauty blender seems okay now, just a couple pale spots. I don't know how this effects the integrity of the sponge. The cleanser says it works by dissolving makeup so I worried my sponge was dissolving. 

Has anybody else had this problem? It doesn't seem like something that's supposed to happen!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, NONSLIP SHOES! I don't know if your store will require them or not, but they will save your life so much. Subway is a slippery store. 

Try to actually learn something in the online training. Some people just run through it then don't know what they're doing. 

Make sure you're great at biting your tongue. That customer doesn't want that tomato? Fine. Just give them another slice. Some of the people that come in to subway are super picky, especially since the food is made right in front of them. These people will only be in your life for a couple minutes. 

If you work in a busy store, be ready to be moving all the time! Don't rest until everything is done. I'm a closer and I bust ass to make sure I have everything prepped, cleaned, and done at least an hour before close so I have time for any emergencies and to sit on my phone. 

Don't be afraid to ask other employees for help. We've all been there. Hell, for my first three weeks I was making flatbread subs inside out! If someone corrects you on something and you know they know what they're doing, correct it. I have a couple people at my store who regardless of correction will continue doing everything wrong. 

That's all I can think of right now. I love helping and training new employees. They're fun.  </TEXT>

I'm know I'm guilty of simply telling a customer were out of crusts if it's almost close and I have better things to do than make a flatizza, but the crust is literally baked flatbread. Any store can make it as long as they also carry meatballs (this means marinara sauce) and flatbread. Not all stores will have the register button though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Easiest way to tell if your thumb is swollen is how it fits your thumb. Your thumb should fit the hole well and be snug, but it shouldn't take any effort to put your thumb in and out of the ball. Make sure you do this test with a straight thumb. Try pushing your thumb nail against the ball when you're in the ball if you're not sure if it's straight. 

If you're struggling a bit to get out of the ball, your thumb might be swollen. There are a couple solutions I've found to work best. 

First solution is low effort and sketchy effectiveness. My thumb and fingers swell a lot after a couple games, so I keep my hand above my heart to lower the blood flow. I'm short so I can do this by resting my elbow on the score screen at the table and keeping my hand up. Tape is also your best friend. Vise hada patches in blue are my favorite. 

The second solution is a bit more pricey, but will be a bit easier in the long run. You could get interchangeable thumb slugs. Get one measured for when your thumb is fitting in your ball just fine and when it's swollen. I haven't seen these around too much where I bowl, but it's a pretty conventional place there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You get what you pay for with balls. I've seen pyramid balls go as low as $30. IIRC, some have a plastic coverstock, which is the same as a house ball. Unless you want to research like hell and buy online (which won't save you much money because you'll be charged for drilling anyways unless you're on a league), talk to your proshop guy. They should set you up with something that's beginner level reactive and a good fit to your bowling style. Once you have a solid main ball, you can pick up a cheap plastic one as a spare ball. If anything, your proshop might have some used Storm laying around that you could get at a super low price since. 

I bought the cheapest shoes that had purple flames on them, so I'll let someone else advise you on show choices. The brand is Etonic. They're sold in my proshop, but they're not the best. Very entry level. 

Proshop guy is god around here when it comes to ball selection, and there's a reason for that.

<TEXT> In all honesty, everyone here freaks out way too much about acrylic. 

I agree COMPLETELY with acrylic being a huge nono is a fresh piercing/stretch. Wearing it for prolonged periods is also bad. 

If you wear acrylic plugs in a completely healthy and healed stretch for a few hours, your ears will not fall off. If you find that you have a reaction, then it's best to avoid it. 

No, acrylic is not the best jewelry and isn't safe to wear for a long time, but if your ears are completely healed and you pop some in for a few hours, you will likely be fine. 

Stretching is one of those hobbies you should only take up if you're willing to go for quality. Keep glass/stone/titanium/etc as your main jewelry. Glass is just as cheap as acrylic if you get it online, so price is hardly a factor when it comes to quality products. 

Paying an extra dollar or two for glass is surely easier than dealing with a reaction from extended acrylic wear.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before doing something extreme, like a sarge Easter, there are little things you can do during your release that might help. I had some ring finger problems too, since I was relying on my ring finger to pull the hook. I ended up having a pretty constantly sore finger and tore open a blister on that finger. I worked on adjusting my release to using my middle finger as the main force in my hook and letting my ring finger just pop out. I already have a callous on my middle finger from writing, so it doesn't hurt at all. The joint pain also stopped since my middle finger is a bit stronger. 

Another solution would be to talk to your pro shop guy and have the pitch, span, and grips checked for a good fit. Your ring joint is likely a little shorter(?) than your middle joint, so one will be drilled closer to the thumb hole than the other. If your ring finger was drilled the same distance from your thumb as your middle finger, you might be straining your joint through the whole release. 

I hope I helped somewhat, albeit I did ramble a bit. I do feel your pain with ring finger problems. I was tempted to pick up a cheap ball off craigslist and have it sarge Easter drilled to see if that would fix all of my problems!  </TEXT>

As for the tunnels, anatometal custom orders are pretty easy, albeit a bit pricey and lengthy depending on what you order. BAF has a great filter which includes wearable area IIRC so definitely put that to work!

<TEXT> Precalc is a much harder course than AP Stats. At my school, people take it as an alternative to precalc. If you're comfortable taking two math classes at once, go for it. The two classes aren't too related-pretty much opposite types of math. Precalc has a lot of algebra and trig where stats has a lot of...stats. I've heard there is much more writing that a typical math class as well. 

Does your school offer AP Macro/Micro economics? If so, take those. Relatively easy courses if you stay on top of the readings as notes, and they're fairly interesting. Taking precalc would be wise since it would better prepare you for any math classes you choose in college. 

In short, if you're willing to do two math classes at once, go for AP Stats and international relations along with precalc.  </TEXT>

If you're looking for a hot sub, steak and cheese on Italian herbs and cheese. I get it toasted with provolone and pepper jack alternating. For veggies, I do lettuce, just enough spinach to cover the lettuce, green peppers, and onions. Mayo, oil, pepper, and oregano. Most delicious sub on the planet. 

For a good cold sub, I go with a BMT on herb and cheese. I always change the cheese on this depending how I feel that day. Today I'd throw american on, but I've used everything down to mozzarella. Lettuce, just two spinach leaves (since I make my own subs and can be difficult with veggies; gauge the artist on this one), tomatoes, two cucumbers (I'm not a big fan, but they add something), green peppers, yellow peppers, and olives. Then add mayo, chipotle, oil, pepper, oregano, and parmasean. 

Definitely bend the subs a bit to fit your own tastes or if your store doesn't offer something I suggested.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Join something! I waited until my junior year to join a sport and it stung. Sports at my school are a bit pricey so my parents didn't want to, but they realized the value of a sport after a college tour. 

If you don't want to join a sport, that's fine. I'm not the best athlete and I joined bowling for my sport so I won't push a sport. There is a ton of other things to do while in high school. 

Get a job. If you do this, hold the job and keep your grades up. If you don't have much extra going on through school, a job will help you save up for college and your boss might just connect you with someone who can land you that internship your freshmen year of college. Having a good relationship with your manager or supervisor is also good as they can serve as a reference on your resume. 

Volunteer! Some schools have clubs for this, others don't. If yours doesn't, start researching local volunteer opportunities. Humane societies and elderly homes are just a couple things that come to mind. Colleges love to see 100+ volunteer hours, and you could build that up over summer. That's barely over 4 days. Just make sure you document these hours. Talk to your counselor and see if volunteer hours go on your transcript. 

Don't have any clubs at your school that you're interested in? You can start with a special interest group, or a big club such as Model United Nations or Bots IQ. You're likely going to need a teacher to help you start a club. If it's one of the bigger clubs such as Model UN or Bots, there may be some fees associated with these, but colleges find participating in more major clubs a very big plus. 

There are lots of things to do in high school, you just have to find them. Flyer for an event on the wall? Flyer asking for students to help set something up or run an event? Grab a couple friends, or even go on your own, and try it out. Worst case scenario is that you don't like it and you move on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colleges like to see rigor, but they also like to see success. I'll have 7 AP classes under my belt by the time I'm out of high school. A few of those were more challenging alternatives to a required course, so they just ended up being the better option. I have all B's in my AP courses, but at my junior conference I was told that would be more impressive to admissions than A's in common core classes. 

The best way to benefit from AP is make sure you take courses that you can hold a 78% or higher in and courses that you are confident you will get the credit for. If money is a challenge for your family, don't load up on AP since the test is $80 per class, although your school might offer assistance options. Check with your guidance councilor on those. 

Overall, you need to assess your own abilities. If you haven't chosen courses for next year already, look at your current classes. Are there any in a subject that you found easy and want an extra challenge in? Does your school offer any AP classes that are interesting? Are you at Spanish/German/etc level 4 this year or through your junior year? Your school might offer an AP level 5 that is challenging, but you will have 4 years of experience in. (Your school's foreign language system may be a bit different than this).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been working on tight lining and doing a wing with liquid liner and I must ask: how the hell do you get it all off? I have eyeliner all over my upper waterline and in my lashes and it's just impossible to get off. I've tried using baby soap since my eyes don't take well to anything but sitting and scrubbing between lashes with a q-tip is a royal pain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the lack of drugstore testers is what attributes to a lot of Ultas used product problems. I was hoping to get my foundation there as a drugstore one, but I couldn't swatch any of it! 

MAC online is definitely a more comfortable experience. While I was at the Macy's counter, I swatched a few shadows to see what I should add to my list since I was already way over my limit for the day. Definitely felt better over there than in the store. I feel like the store is there for people who know exactly what they're looking for and aren't too concerned with how much it costs. Maybe that'll be me in a few years, but for now I'm just fine with swatching at Macy's and picking up some products online.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was pretty much how my experience went! I guess I got lucky compared to others here; the staff at my Ulta were all very willing to help and seemed to know what they were doing. The store was also very clean and well stocked. Only problem I had was the used products problem. I bought two NYX concealer sticks and right before I got to the register, I realized one was used! They weren't even sealed! Still signed up for the rewards card since my good experience definitely calls for a revisit. 

I also went to Sephora, MAC, and I browsed the MAC selection at Macy's since the actual store was a bit intimidating. Sephora was what I expected, I probably should have accepted the employees' help after circling the store three times for a beauty blender! I think with MAC, I'll be sticking to the Macy's counter. It seemed to be all the same things but with prices posted and less people glaring at me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some coupons are location specific. Was it a printed coupon or from one of those official coupon clipper things or the newspaper? Granted, even if it is a bigger coupon, they may still not accept. They should change their sign to say as such. 

On the other hand, that employee may have a rude and/or lazy one. In my store, we accept any coupon we can, but a sign for showing coupons ahead of time would be great. Often, people will bring in BOGO coupons, get three steak subs, then at the register I have to explain to them why the coupon is invalid. 

The new menus make using coupons really tough on customers since they don't list subs as regular or premium anymore, so a lot of people come in thinking anything without extra cheese or bacon works with a coupon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find that sticking to my diet is a lot easier when I accept invitations to go out to eat. Granted, I make sure it's not an every day event. But I allow some time for a treat and just try to order something healthier when I'm out to eat. I know that when I get home and when I eat tomorrow, I'll be right back on the diet train. If anything, I'll do a little extra cardio. 

With the comments, I try to block them out with people that I don't know too well. If it's a closer friend that I know I can say a dick comment to, I'll give them a snarky reply and it usually shuts them down. One of my friends is pretty against eating healthy and thinks it below them, so I go out of my way to point out how energized I feel and how I'm just not lethargic at all whenever she complains about being tired or groggy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally, keep oils out of a fresh stretch for a week or so until it's healed. I find it best to do massages with the jewelry out so it gets into the piercing and the piercing has time to relax. 

For cleaning, when the stretch is fresh, it's okay to do a soak with the jewelry in, just like its a fresh piercing. If the stretch is all healed up then you can take the jewelry out for sea salt soaks.  </TEXT>

The white, a couple different browns, and maybe a gray or something would make an ideal palette for me right now.

I'd be willing to spend ~$10 on a palette right now, give or take a bit until I get a bit more confident in my skills.

That was my favorite eyeshadow a couple years ago when I was rocking the middle school look. White shadow and black waterline. 

But it was a great quality eyeshadow and I tossed it before writing down the name. Regretted that until I tracked it down. I think this is the product, although the far left color was white on my quad. 

Does anybody know of where I can get this product or a good dupe of it? It was a Physicians Formula Mineral Wear quad but I don't know exactly which colors. I feel like it was discontinued ages ago since I can't find it anywhere on the PF website.   </TEXT>

My thumb hole isn't the problem, my thumb size just fluctuates a ton and I didn't put tape on when my thumb told me I needed tape. Ended up blistering then ripping. Life lessons from bowling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could ask the employees, but they'll definitely look at you funny. I don't even know if we're allowed to do that. You could always add it afterwards. 

With the prices, they've been going up for a while. Over here in the Midwest, our new menus are really enraging customers. Cheapest sub is $4 and its a six inch. Cheapest footlong is $5.75. I have a feeling subway is slowly moving away from the $5 footlong since it's not too profitable. 

Overall, prices and cheeses are very reasonable. You could decide on your favorite store in your area and talk to them about adding provolone to their options. Chances are, it's very available to them, they just don't know if there's a demand for it. If you'll buy it, they might just add it since it's not a discontinued item.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pick up some glass single flare from a piercing shop or body art forms. Much easier to stretch with and much safer. Also, head over to Menards or Home Depot (or any hardware store) and pick up a roll of PTFE tape. It's a good $1 or so and IIRC, it's a bit thinner than bondage tape so it's easier to stretch with. Also, the emu oil or vitamin e oil should help more than jojoba for stretching since they're a bit slicker than jojoba. Just remember to completely saturate the PTFE before you wear it or it'll dry out your ears. 

My ears aren't very stretchy either. Just gotta go slow and spoil them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's okay for it to be a bit pink on the inside, especially after a fresh stretch. You're on the right track though! Stick with quality jewelry, and you're doing the right thing with massages. Also, you might be able to size up in a month, but if your ears start saying no halfway down the taper, it's okay to wait. Some people have no problem getting through small sizes and others take a while to size up from the start. 

Also, be prepared for a bit of frustration, and don't be like me and try to calculate when you'll be at your goal size. You'll be disappointed due to time between stretches increasing with size. It took me 4 months to go from 8g to 6g and I eventually got frustrated and taped up. It's the first full mm stretch, so it's a bit of a fight. Whenever you feel ready to just shove the taper through or add one more layer of tape than usual, look at some of the posts by people who've blown out and you'll want to wait. There's people here with 2" ears. Your goal size is possible. They didn't get there over night, or even in a couple months. 

It's a bit early so I rambled a bit, but stick with generally accepted methods, good jewelry, and don't rush at all. You're asking early, so you're getting a head start on healthy lobes!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So tonight was my first meet at a high oil lane and a longer lane than I'm used to. It was also extremely cold on the bus ride to the alley and in the alley.

My home and proshop alley is nice and room temperature and it's also been a warm winter, so when I got drilled, my thumb was a bit bigger, if not swollen. During practice before we started, my ball fell off my hand. Just dropped. Anyone else ever have the problem of a suddenly too big thumb hole? Usually my thumb swells and needs tape and everything, but today I couldn't feel the hole snug on all sides. This led to me gripping the ball and doing terribly. Should I put in some white tape? The cold weather is sticking around now, but I don't want to be where I usually am with my thumb pretty much stuck and tape in my thumb slug. 

Now my next big problem. I have a Tropical Breeze, so it's a low to medium oil ball. These lanes were drenched. My usual strike shot is standing at 17/18 and target at the second arrow. I ended up having to stand at 23 and target the third arrow to get anywhere near the pocket. No hook at all, or revs. I was really regretting not getting the Crux I was eyeing up since this is my first ball. I've read it's high oil? 

TL;DR: How do you bowl high oil with a low oil ball? Any solutions when it's so cold that my ball fits like a house drill? Bad meet due to conditions, and I want to know how to improve, especially on those conditions since I'm at that alley again next week.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meet on Monday went terrible. Our team only has 3 so we get 6 frames a game, and we lost a game with only 4 frames in a game. 

Practice went great, though, although nothing I did followed my coach. He wanted me to get more revs on the house ball because I was skidding to the point of rolling with a slight backwards spin. Okay, more revs it is. There's the gutter. Skid the ball down the lane? Strike it is. House balls are bad. 

And for the reason I was on a house ball. I took my ball in last week Wednesday to get drilled, and the pro shop guy said Friday or so. I couldn't pick it up over the weekend, so it didn't matter that it was Friday. I'd get it my next practice on Tuesday. Pro shop guy isn't in. No problem. I go in on Wednesday to pick it up and the pro shop guy said the papers got moved around so he couldn't drill it over the weekend. Now, I'm not exactly mad about this. I'm getting the drilling at a huge discount and I'll finally have my ball so in pretty excited, I'm just worried about only having one practice on it before the meet next Monday. I'll have to come in over the weekend to practice with it since it's my first fingertip. I'm hoping it bumps my average over 100 and my fill above 55%. 
/rant 

If you guys have any at-home tips I can use to get used to my ball, it would be super appreciated.  </TEXT>

I'm going with school, so I'm a bit restricted on things I can bring and do. What would you recommend for things I bring for the plane and for the trip overall? We're staying with host families and hotels, and it's recommended we bring a gift for our hosts. What would you recommend as a gift? I've heard peanut butter is a good option, but I feel like a lot of students will be doing that. Any help is appreciated, as I know nothing about traveling. 

Also, do they have kinder surprise in Spain? I love them but the US has a problem with them. 

Edit: I'm going with my Spanish class, so language books are taken care of, but I will be looking into guide books!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Subway (sandwiches, not trains). 

-This rule goes in general for most cashiers, most likely. If I've already rung in your order and am getting your change, please don't dig in your pockets and say "oh, I have 48!" The register just told me what to give you and it's in my hand, I'm not calculating your new change when there's a line. Keep your 48. 

-Please don't shove your notebook or phone with a list of orders at me. I can't hold your grubby phone while making subs, and I know you can read. I don't mind if you come in with a list (I recommend this over a phone call!), but I can't touch it and i don't want to drop your stuff in the lettuce. 

-We don't have $5 footlongs anymore. No, I can't change the prices on your order because you didn't know. Please stop yelling at me; I didn't make the price change. 

-If you have a coupon, ask about it ahead of time. Like before you order. Nobody reads the coupons. Regular subs only. That doesn't mean a sub on regular bread. We're more than happy to help you with the menu-the new design is weird. 

TL;DR: don't change your payment when I'm giving you your change, and read the menu and your coupons ahead of time

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my board has some problems. I told the guys at my shop that I was goofy, but I learned I'm regular. This happened because I was riding a plastic board from good will, so I sucked goofy and regular and picked one when I got a good board. I've been riding my board backwards. Is this a problem? I've seen it a couple times in videos, but I did it for pretty much a full season. 

Then there's the problem of my board sat in a closet all last season. Was this bad? It didn't go into it with an end of season wax or anything; Id only gotten it waxed once on the first season. 

My bindings are backwards. So, I'm assuming my stomp pad is now in the wrong spot and my safety strap thing is on the wrong foot. How do I fix all of this? 

Third, and probably my biggest problem is my base. It doesn't look too happy. It has a couple scratches, which are probably okay. But I think it has base burn. http://imgur.com/a/3faxR 
I scratched at it a bit in a small spot and it came off, so does it just need a good cleaning and waxing? I didn't know too much when I first got this board, so I wasn't too nice to it. I know a couple chips and scrapes are going to happen, but I don't want my base messed up this soon. 

It's a 5150 Velour, but the bindings are 5150 Empress. I've never done my own wax job before, so I don't have an iron or anything. My shop charges $50 for the tune up and $20 to fiddle with bindings, so I'm hoping to be able to do this myself. 

TL;DR: Please help me fix my board. It's backwards and burnt, and I don't know what I'm doing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How exactly do you do a sea salt soak? I've seen salt:water ratios all over this subreddit but not how to do it. I've been using H2Ocean so I've been just spraying it on. I've heard of putting your lobes in a shot glass of the water, but my lobes aren't quite big enough for that. Bowl? Cotton ball? I want to make my lobes happy without spraying salt water everywhere.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to start taping to get up to a 6g. After 4 weeks, I was at a 6. I added an inch or so of tape every two weeks and was there in no time. My ears aren't very stretchy, so yours might tape up quicker. But make sure to take taping slow as well since you're still stretching your skin.  And keep them well oiled!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where exactly do you plan on taking the laptop that you don't want the school to know about? They know your address. They know where libraries are. If you stop at McDonalds on the way home, they won't care. Chances are, the location tracking is to prevent theft and to track the Chromebook if it's lost or stolen. The tech department has more important things to worry about than looking at the whereabouts of teenagers and their school laptops. If you're worried about the thing having access to the webcam without your permission, cover it with a post it. Use it responsibly and you shouldn't have anything to worry about. It's a big investment for the school so naturally they have a lot of security measures in place. Use your own device to play around and do things you don't want your teachers to know about. If they take screenshots of you writing a paper or taking notes, then they'll just know that you're working.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't have a gauge card, such as the freebies from BAF, you could use a caliper or a ruler to measure your tapers and match them to a gauge size chart. Some sizes will have a bit of deviation, but most are on target. In regards to neosporin, I wouldn't recommend it. Head over to walmart and pick up a bottle of vitamin e oil. Much better for stretching and much cheaper.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ultimately, they are your parents, so their decision is what you want to go by to keep tension lo was long as they're the boss. My dad doesn't want me "gauging" at all, yet my mom doesn't care much either way. My goal size is 2g so it's easy to hide, especially at my correct 8g. I'd recommend talking to your parents and make sure to show your dad that you know the proper and safe way to stretch and be stretched and the consequences that come with stretching along with how you plan on dealing with employment (parents love to use that one). If your dad is still against it after you try to show that stretching isn't the end of the world, show cooperation and agree to downsize until you're an adult. If anything, he will see it as a sign of maturity and change his mind, especially as parents tend to see stretched ears as rebellion. Cooperation completely breaks that. 

TL;DR: talk to them and cooperate with your parents. The worst that can happen is your dad doesn't budge and you have to downsize until you're an adult.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just waiting until the next size slides in is probably the best way to stretch! I only clean my ears with H2ocean when they're super irritated or the week after a new stretch. For taping, a common size to start is the jump from 8 to 6. I think it's the first full millimeter, so it's a bit harder for ears to adjust. However, when you start taping is completely up to your ears.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think 15-16 is the minimum. At that age, you have an okay scope of a job, college, and the rest of your life. At 10, you're hardly out of elementary school (if that). I also think that piercings should be fully the decision of the one being pierced. Pierced babies always frustrate me. I understand that the school and parents are okay with it, but I hope she was given a talk about how future employers might not be okay with it. I've wanted stretched ears when I was younger, but I didn't even know how people wanted to do it; I thought you needed some type of surgery, which my parents would never allow. Once I got a bit older and a bit more educated on it, along with showing responsibility, my mom allowed it. I definitely think 10 is too young to start stretching, but I don't think there should be any laws or regulations on it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my experience, Wal-Mart does better piercings than Claire's. My first holes were done by Claires, and I needed a taper to go to 16g, but my second holes could go up to 14 right away. My first holes have also been extremely sensitive. This is also problematic for me because I want to stretch to 2g, but I don't want my ears funny looking with the outside being the larger hole.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> bodyartforms.com all the way. I've had completely good experience with them, and you get free o rings and a sticker along with a gauge card with every order, and who doesn't like free things? They also have a huge selection (with decent prices) and excellent service. Their shipping rates are also decent, and it's only $1 to add insurance to the order.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read on BAF that Kaos is discontinuing their o rings. Is there anywhere else that sells clear silicone? With my recent BAF orders, I've been choosing the clear o rings as the freebies since they're not like the standard black ones that come with everything, but since they're being discontinued, I might need a new source.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about acrylic </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-02 04:46:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I started wearing some 14g acrylic spirals in a healed stretch, and I noticed that a really small area around/in the piercing was a reddish pink. I didn't know if this was just dye coming off of the spirals, or a reaction to them. My ears don't feel irritated while wearing them. I clean the spirals with rubbing alcohol and a q tip and they usually turn the q tip pink which is why I thought it was maybe the dye.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Dawnguard Spoiler](#dg "If you haven't been to (or found) Ancestor Glade yet, I definitely recommend it. It is by far, one of the most beautiful and mysterious places in the game. It's just south east of Peak's Shade Tower in a mountain near Falkreath. There's a few spriggans, but after getting past those, is a large cavern similar to the Gildergreen Sanctuary. There's odd trees with unharvestable bark (unless you have the proper tool) so bring the nettlebane if you have it in case that will work. This is one of those locations that I probably wouldn't have found if I didn't climb mountains a lot, so it's easy to miss but worth the travel. If anyone knows any more about it, sharing is great!") </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I died in Unity recently, and hadn't made a bed yet, so I'm back to square one and I'm afraid my stuff will have despawned by the time I make it halfway to Unity. If you come across a large pile (full inventory) of stings including an enchanting table, a couple brewing stands, some diamond, and a bunch of watermelon, it is probably mine (if there is a stack of beef in it, it is definitely mine). If you are willing to return some of the stuff to me, that's great! As a reward, well, I'm willing to negotiate. Probably most of the diamonds as I don't find too much use for them. And a brewing stand or two if you want.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being a freshman, this is a dangerous attempt buuuut, here goes. 
 1. Walk on the right side of the hallway. I don't wish for you to walk over me.
 2. Don't you dare point out we were supposed to turn in homework 10 minutes before class ends. 
 3. Upperclassmen own the school. Get over it.
 4. If you are a freshman, walk against the wall. It saves the rest of the planet from walking into your backpack.
 5. Do not announce it is your birthday if you did not bring a snack. 85% of people at school don't care.
 6. We know you're tired. Anyone who has to wake up at 4:30 in the morning for school is tired. Stop complaining and go to sleep. </TEXT>

I was asked by a teacher to put together a powerpoint and the class was absolutely hooked by singing holograms. It really is fun to research. You could write a persuasive paper on a famous (or even controversial) person. I have a friend who wrote a persuasive essay on why Ivan the Terrible wasn't actually that terrible. Freedom and the Internet is also a go-to topic for me.   </TEXT>

Number two was when I decided to grab my cup for a drink of that lovely beverage. Miss. I hit the cup and the milk went flying on my phone. I have never ran so fast than when I did to get some rice to throw my phone in. I also managed to wipe excess milk off with my shirt. It has survived (for now-last time it got wet, it took days to take effect) and is currently in a bag of rice. Fuck.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I was thinking about coping today... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-07 05:05:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking (instead of catching frisbees) about support. From others. I started to relate it to a bed of nails. Have you ever laid on one? It's painless (unless your hair gets caught!). Why? Because there are so many nails to rely on. Think of your supports, whether drawing, or a friend, or a sibling, destroying bubblewrap, painting, whatever those supports are that stop you from self harming at that moment, as the nails in the nail bed. It REALLY hurts to lay on just one nail alone, and if the bed of nails is just in the sky, you will fall without support. The more you have, the better and easier it is. I'm getting somewhere with this. And where I'm going is, find something. Some type of support for yourself. You can talk to someone, draw, sing, listen to music, or do something silly like wear as many shoes as possible then make noises, it doesn't matter! If it stops you from hurting yourself or others, do it! I'd like to find someone who went to the ER for drawing their cat as the Mona Lisa. 

* **TL;DR:** The more nails (supports) you have, the less it hurts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually agree with this a ton. Harry was quite the asshole in the last book. Ron and Hermione were *constantly* trying to help and instead of contributing to the suggestions they gave him, he decided to do what he wanted and argued with them about why they were wrong. We get it Harry, you have no family. No need to start all of the angst so soon. Leave it in the fanfiction please. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other than that I've spent the past fifteen minutes trying to catch the snitch, I actually ended up seeing Dumbledore in a new light going for round two of the books. I was completely with Snape when he said Dumbledore had practically raised Harry like a pig for slaughter. I don't know if I didn't see it the first time because of all of that Dumbledore sparkle or what, but it took a second reading of the whole series and some movie watching to see how that worked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a [horrible] friend that was homeschooled. She entered public school in 7th grade. Bad move. Her social skills were HORRIBLE. As in, she had her own cell phone, but left it at home (which was across the street from school) so she would use one of our cell phones. I'm fine letting my friends use my phone if their's is dead, they don't have one, or they forgot it that day. But she does it intentionally. She also had a bad habit of being...stuck up? Nosy? Acted like she was better and knew more because she skipped a grade. Not to mention, all of the times I have invited her over, she never slept over. Once she had a mattress to herself, a lamp on, all the pillows and blankets necessary, and then insisted on turning a fan on (in October!). Two of us were already sharing a mattress and one was on a pile of blankets, so we were ticked. Then she left at about 11 to which we were all happy. Sorry if this seemed more like a rant, and I could go on, but from my experiences, many of the homeschool (even private school) students I've met have not been pleasant. I have met a total of one homeschool student that was nice, but she also has been in sports, therefore, interacting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother in law has worked countless hours in factories for the past six years to support my sister, my niece, and now my newborn nephew, and my sister doesn't even give him a birthday card or say thank you. He's sacrificed everything down to his laptop (she kept hers though) to keep them out of the streets and she is asking for a new otter box. She also hasn't had a full time job in the whole time they've been together...spent the past six years on an assistant teacher degree that she dropped out on a month before she would have finally graduated.  </TEXT>

When I was in kindergarten (not too long ago actually, about about nine years ago), we had blocks. Not legos. Blocks that would connect to each other up and down but you had to tape them together to make cars and such. Not iPads. Yet at my school we have two 6 year old Macs for all of us to share then a bunch of PCs. Kids need to start being kids again.  </TEXT>
