<TEXT> As a 17 year old male just coming out of high school, I can tell you that studying is important. Make sure you have a firm grasp on all concepts you learn in math because they all come back. English is incredibly important as well because of SAT and ACT tests. Study your butt off and do well in those two subjects.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Huh. Where I come from there's a strong difference. Redheads can have darker skin tones. The only requirement to being a redhead is having red hair. Ginger is a subcategory found within the redhead group. Gingers have pale skin, freckles, and very very red hair. They sunburn easily and have no souls.

<TEXT> Pigs have orgasms that can last for up to 30 minutes. 

The Allied powers in World War 2 tried to put female hormones in Hitler's food in order to make him more feminine and less capable of leading a war. (looks like they were more sexist back then too) 

Because whales are so large, sometimes a third whale needs to swim underneath two copulating whales to hold them afloat and keep them from sinking.

Because a smaller object would have marginally less air resistance, it would fall faster. Therefore, due to physics, a frog dropped out of a helicopter would be faster than a cow.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry in advance buuuuuttttttt he sounds like a dick. (I'm a guy btw) You make it sound like you're trying and you want to be great for him, and he is just using you as a hole for sex. The fact that he "doesn't talk during sex" really shouldn't be an excuse for why he isn't helping you build your confidence. Now I realize that telling you this isn't going to help at all, it isn't really constructive. This is just feedback and my opinion on what I'm noticing from your post. I would suggest working out. Many people that I know who had similar problems with confidence found themselves growing more comfortable with their bodies and abilities as lovers when they exercise frequently. Honestly sex feels great. I have sex all the time and it doesn't really matter what she does, it always feels nice. If she does a little extra stuff that feels cool too, but almost no matter what you do he will enjoy it and like it a lot. Don't freak out about it :)

Well good! I'd far prefer for abused people to grow up and become happy and productive members of society. Unfortunately for me, I'm stuck with my asshole of a cousin who, for some unfathomable reason, has decided she doesn't want to fit in with the demographic that you so eloquently pointed out exists. Imagine that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nearly every major pc game that has come out after 2014 is unplayable unless you have an $800+ computer. I mean, I can turn down the graphics and visual settings pretty dang far, but when you're playing with the same resolution as an ipod touch things are just a little bit ridiculous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know one abused girl. She is a huge asshole. She also happens to be my cousin and lives with me. 
I dunno where you got your info but from personal experience abused people are jerks. Everyone always says "you don't know what she went through" but I mean c'mon, it was for like a year when she was 6. That's no excuse to be an ass.  </TEXT>
