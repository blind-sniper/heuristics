And if I may say, it doesn't only happen in Asia. It happens in Europe, too. Let us not be partial here and condemn only the poorer countries. That's one reason why richer countries can get away with their crimes because many of us turn a blind eye when it comes to bigger countries.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I read this from the Internet, and I know I had to share it. It will make you think of the phrase: You come in this world with nothing and you die with nothing. One man obviously didnt feel this was the case when he asked his wife, When I die, can you bury all of the money with me?.

He wanted her to put it all in the casket with him. Thinking that she would fulfill his last dying wish he thought nothing more of it.

During his working life this man was a real cheapskate, and only spent when he really had to. He saved it all in this little shoe box you can see below.

When he eventually passed away, He was laid out and his wife sat next to her life-long friend. When the ceremony was just about to finish, and the coffin was about to be covered he wife screamed, Wait one second!.

He was stretched out in the casket, the wife was sitting there in black next to their best friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, Wait a minute! She walked over and placed the shoebox in the casket.
Her friend asked her, Surely you werent silly enough to put all that money in there! The women responded, Yeh I had to keep my promise, I am a good Christian, Id never break a promise.
The friend said, What! You put every last cent in there with him?!
The women responded, No, I counted it all up, put it in my bank account, and wrote him a cheque!
