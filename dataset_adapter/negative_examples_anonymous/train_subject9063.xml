<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there, I'm interested in starting up animation as a small hobby, I was just curious as to what programs would be useful in starting myself off? I'm looking for any program that might have lots of pre-set templates that would be able to help me in studying the basic concepts of animation with an easy pre-cursor to more advanced things.

Sorry if this sounds like a silly request, have no real background on animation programs, the only thing I've really done in the past is stop motion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most old installations have what we call rewireable fuses that have a significantly higher trip time and ampage capacity. So therefore a large amount of current can be flowing for a lot longer before the blow. They don't exactly blow but the wire just melts and this is why we don't use them any more. The new standards in the current 17th edition wiring regs clearly state that those kind of fuses can no longer be used in rewires or new builds. Edit: this post was to indicate I wasn't talking about Cartridge fuses which are of course still legal but never used in a domestic distro board. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys I'm new to this subreddit so just wanted some basic info and to introduce myself. I live in Wales in the UK and I'm currently studying towards fully qualifying, I am part qualified already to the C G level 2. Soon I will have finished level 3 and will be working towards my NVQ. My biggest question is, are there any Welsh electricians using this sub that could help me in the long run? All my very local companies are highly unhelpful and I'm at wits end trying to get practical experience.  So any tips or leads would be extremely helpful! Thanks in advance guys :) oh and as an edit I would like to add that I live in south wales! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you'll find that a lot of homes around the world including america but specially here in the uk still have rewirable fuses on their distribution boards. They are still legal but nowhere near as safe for blowing out in risky high amp situations. And also not legal to put in to new houses or when doing a rewire on an old house.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a qualified electrician and lighting technician for film and television working on the likes of Dr. Who and such. I have to remind you that not all MCB's have the same breaking capacity and its' not just the MCB that dictates what can be run on a single circuit but the gauge and the type of the wiring used. Yes what you have said is typical of a standard 1mm lighting circuit but not a standard ring main used for power or anything else for that matter. </TEXT>

To be honest a badge reading I'm deaf does not prepare you for how to deal with the situation and that persons employers should be taking more steps to avoid this kind of thing.

<TEXT> A lot of people say to go WE if you are behind when you start ganking and BOTRK if you are ahead. Personally I always start WE then finish FF I usually have enough gold by the time I stack it up to have both. Two tank items depending on team comp and who's fed. Then BOTRK but alas I am a lowly silver player so I'm probably doing it all wrong! 

I do agree BOTRK is a stronger item but is a lot more expensive and by hitting the power spike of FF and WE by the 17 minute mark or so I think it helps out a lot more for the early to mid game. 

Correct me anyone if you think I'm wrong would like to know if what I'm doing is correct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will have to try this, I've lately had great success jungling with ww at silver elo and never once thought that perhaps I should invade solo. High risk high reward I suppose! Although as ww I do always pink my red before going blue at the start anyway so I never get solo countered only by 5 man groups which has happened a fair few times!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I main ww and I use the exact same path and always hit 6 at around the 7 minute mark. I've tried the other routes but find the one you use the most efficient due to his sustain and lack of need to clear both buffs quickly. The only time I will deviate is if I fear being invaded at either buffs.

Also another quick note if you don't already do this is to start with a pink and save your 50 remaining gold for your first back don't waste it on a hp pot at the start its really not needed on ww. </TEXT>
