<TITLE> A bedtime story </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-22 06:09:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was little my mother used to tell me the same bedtime story over and over again. And while it might not sound like anything bad the particular story used to me the not afraid of having monsters under the bed, but it did something worse. The story made me afraid of walking on the carpet with no socks or shoes on and the story goes like this.
Once upon a time when the house was first built it was owned by a lonely man and he was very fond of feet. No one knew when his fetish began, but when it did he obsessed over it to the point where people began to avoid him as much as possible. And it made him go a little crazy, so one day he came up with a plan to cut someone's feet off and keep them, but it didn't go as he expected.
He did find a girl, kidnaped her, and drugged her, but when he left to get his saw, he came back to discovered that she was gone and do you know what happened next? At this point, I would be shivering underneath the covers scared and even though I would nod my head she would continue the story anyway.
The girl snuck behind the man and hit him in the back of the head once, twice, three times with a vase under he finally fell. But that didn't stop the girl from continuing to beat his head until his blood was firmly soaked into the carpet and his head was no longer recognizable. Then the girl left and everyone lived happily ever after, but no really. The man lived a few ways from town and when he suddenly disappeared no one wanted to check on him because they were disturbed of his fetish so people started to pretend he didn't exist and started to pretend that they didn't smell the stench of decay coming from his house.
But exactly one year after his death strange things started happening, people started disappearing and some woke up with their feet missing. But all the reports had one thing in common, all of the events happened when the victim walked barefoot on a carpet. And after the conclusion was made the people in the town just knew that the feet loving man was responsible, so they band together and made way for his house, but when they busted the door down they were surprised at what they saw. 

There was blood on the walls and dripping from the ceiling, there were dead bodies littered everywhere, but no feet to be found. So everyone split up into groups to search the house and some people were left outside due to their weak stomach. The house was stuffy and the dark, but the townspeople didn't care they wanted to find the culprit of the bloodshed and murder and that's exactly what they found. A young woman by the name of Ruby was ahead of the group who were chosen to explore the basement she opened the door and peeked her head through before she shined her flashlight. At first she didn't see anything until she saw a lump in the corner, she thought about yelling behind her and telling her group about what she was about to do but decided against it. She thought it was nothing and wanted to get out of the house as soon as possible, so she kept the door the open and crept slowly and quietly towards the shadow in the corner of the basement. She shined her flashlight on it and dropped it when she finally realized what she was looking at, but that attracted the shadow's attention. 

It was a gray blob of ashen flesh with feet stuck around it, some were so buried into the blob that only toes were visible. And the worst part is that the feet flexed and moved they were alive, some toes on the side of the blob wiggled at Ruby as if in greeting before the mass began to slowly make its way towards her. Poor Ruby was too petrified to move or speak and the only smart thing she did was the thing that saved her. Someone from her group noticed that she was missing and went ahead to find her and got there in time to save her. And when Ruby finally got her breathing under control and told everyone what had happened the monster got out and attack two people already. So the mayor had everyone leave the house and had it closed down, since nobody wanted to kill the monster and no one knew if condemning the house would kill the monster of free it. 

"But why can't I walk on the carpet?" I asked in my scared little child voice.

"Because the monster had to get his feet from somewhere." My mom said in a mushy voice, trying to mimic me. 

"I don't wanna get my feet eaten." I would say in almost crying.

"Well wear shoes or socks to confuse the monster so he won't eat your precious little feet." She said in a chipper voice, before she shuffled from the side of my bed in her house slippers and closed the door to my room, leaving me in darkness. 

And so nosleep I have come here to tell you that I'm going to face my fears and walk barefoot on the carpet of my apartment. I had called my mother to tell her about what I was about to do, but she sounded confused on the phone and told me that she never told me that story before. That gives me even more insurance that it was just my imagination and that there's no monster in the carpet, wish me luck!

<TEXT> I thought the other condo was showing you many ways you could die. For instance you said that you could barely afford your condo, so what if you get a loan from that guy and he kills you. And if you date that black haired lady she might kill you as well, so what if you killed yourself the first time you looked through the window because you couldn't handle the images anymore. So maybe you shouldn't look through the window anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You know when people are trying to scare you and they put on a frightened face and say "There's something behind you." Well my one of my friends, whom I will call Maria keeps telling me to look behind me, and of course I don't because I don't want to play her stupid game. 

So I decide that if I don't do what she says, she'll will drop it right? No, Maria wouldn't quit with that annoying sentence, and eventually that was all she would say to me on Facebook and when she texted me on her phone.

Then one day while i'm one my bed eating candy on my bed, Maria's mom calls and asks me if I had seen heard her. And when I ask her mom why, she tells me that Maria left to have a surprise sleepover with me. And after talking a while she tells me that she'll keep in touch and to call her if I see her, then she hangs up on me.

So I sit there letting the realization that my best friend went missing after coming to see me, and suddenly the sour worms that I threatened to come up again. So I rushed to the bathroom and through the door open, and after a few minutes of gagging, but I didn't throw up thankfully, I notice a banging sound coming from the front door so walk through the house to see who it is and it's just then that I notice how dark it was in there. 

My parents weren't home and even though I wasn't afraid of the dark, the atmosphere in the house was enough to make me jump out of my skin. And all the while the banging on the door doesn't stop, so hesitantly I look through the peephole and i'm delighted to see Maria standing there impatiently waiting for me to open the door.

"Maria!" I exclaimed pulling my friend into a bear hug. She smiled and hugged me back, when she pulled back she gave me a puzzled look "Why didn't your parents answer the door?" she asked. Now it was my turn to be puzzled "What are you talking about, they aren't here." I told her not listening to anything else she was saying. She pointed outside and I poked my head from out the house, their car was there, but that doesn't make any sense. I thought I heard a car pull away. Maria's face is no longer relaxed and she grew rigid, "Stay there." She commanded, dropping her bags and running upstairs to my parents room.

I tried to call out to her, but she was already halfway up the stairs. I waited patiently until I heard a gasp escape from her lips, I ran upstairs myself, I tried to look into my parent's room, but Maria turned me around with trembling hands so that I couldn't see what was inside their room. But I still caught a glimpse of blood stained walls."Don't look behind you." Maria whispered in my ear, and I felt my stomach drop, I rushed into the bathroom in time to throw up my sour worms. I shook violently and choked as tears and vomit splashed into the toilet, somewhere in the distance I heard Maria calling her mother, crying as well. When Maria come into the bathroom to check on me, I lashed out on her "Why did you do!" I screamed at her. She backed up and told me to calm down, but I couldn't, she thought this was some game, well I was done playing. 

I whipped out my phone and showed her the text messages of that sentence she kept texting me. She paled when I showed her the messages "What!" I screamed. She opened her mouth, then closed it, she collapsed on the tile of the bathroom floor before she spoke "I didn't send you that, my phone was taken away, that's the reason my mom didn't know where I was. That couldn't have been me." If I could have paled even more I would have, non of that made any sense! I grabbed Maria's hand and pulled her out the bathroom, we needed to get out of here. We had just made it outside when a police car pulled up with Maria's mom in the front. She jumped out the car and hugged us both.

My parents were viciously murdered, and the police found out who did it, but they didn't capture him yet. So Maria, her mom and I moved into another state, since I didn't have any relatives that wanted to take me in, it only made since that I live with them. But the reason I write to you is because recently, i've been getting text messages that bring up bad memories, and I don't think Maria has been sending them to me.

But I can't especially can't handle being in the dark, knowing that those really aren't shadows and that the basement isn't suppose to be dark, I know because I cut the lights on and shined my flashlight down there.
