<TEXT> I already try to talk to her, in my experience, time can heal you but can also drag you down very fast. This is something I want to prevent at all cost. I really do hope it's just a phase and she'll snap out of it.

I drove home for the night so we could have dinner and he seems allright, laughing from time to time and making jokes so I'm carefully hopefull :)

And glad to hear that you seems to do allright, I doubt I can make you a whole lot better but if it's any help, I have tough about you, that stranger from Reddit, quite a few times today and I really do hope you're good! *internet hug* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

Thank you for your response.

I have indeed tought about the fact that it might be possible that she's hiding something. However, I do not think this is the case. She was never the type of person to hide stuff from her family, no matter how embarrassing/painfull.  

Plus, she also says that this is the main reason why she's so confused, she doesn't know why she is feeling so depressed. I believe that it is something she might be unaware of, or something she refuses to face..

I like the quote by your father since it adresses what I think is the root of her problem. Will definitely use this the next time I have a chance to sit down and talk with her about this. Thanks alot!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Older brother seeking help for my sister. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-09 12:14:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My little sister (she's 20, but I have 2 and she's the youngest, therefor my little sister) has been diagnosed with depression a couple of weeks ago.

I never saw it coming, she always was the most cheerful one out of our family of 5, has an amazing boyfriend who loves her, has tonnes of friends, popular, beautiful.. You get the picture.
Because of my work, I can't be home often and she's at uni most of the time anyway.

The last time I saw her it really shocked me how sad she looked, the light always visible in her eyes seemed to have faded away, she looked tires, didn't say much..
I went out to dinner with my dad and he told me it has been declining for a while now and I can see that it hurts my parents tremendously to see her suffer like this.

Now, I went trough something simular when I was in uni but got very good at hiding it and eventually got better because I got help and decided what was worth obsessing over and what not.

I'm afraid that she will not have this strenght, she never had any major troubles in her life and I can see she's not dealing with this well at all.
She is getting professional help but this can only go so far.

As her older brother, I alwasy felt like she looked up to me so my question now is, what is my best course of action? What do I do or say to help her in any way possible?
Mind you, I'm able to see her or meet up with her from time to time but this is once every 2 weeks max.

I already told her I was in a simular situation, what I did to help myself and how I eventually got out. The big difference between the 2 of us is that I kinda knew what was keeping me down, **she does not know**

Only thing that we can think of is that she sets really high (unrealistic) standards for herself, is perfectionistic and does not handle the stress coming from this very well.

So Reddit, what do and what say?

Thank you so much for helping me, I'm kind of lost and it kills me to see my baby sister like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid, M.A.A.D. city. It's more than an album, it's a lifestory told in the most fitting way possible

Edit: For anyone familiar with the album, so worth the read: http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=313845.0

<TITLE> [Idea] ARAM, only better. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-13 16:20:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not going to lie, I just had a rather frustrating game in ARAM, one of those were you see the loading screen and wish you could go afk if it wasn't for the '9X poppy afk's that would certainly follow.

Then I started thinking, why do I even play this gamemode? You sometimes lose 20 minutes+ of you're time in a game you have no chance of winning.

 'I do it for fun, I don't care if we win or lose' Good for you, but my game time/day is limited and I actually do feel a bit frustrated after those game. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not the type of guy that 'likes ARAM as long as we have a good team and win'. I like it because of the teamfights and the practice you get.

Problem with ARAM tough, you're teamcomp is sometimes so random and/or shit that you learn nothing by playing it. So why not make a gamemode where everyone get's assigned 1 role from the current meta and plays a champ that is considered to be that role. Not only would this make it more fair, it would make it a whole lot more realistic because you play with actual comps that you can see in normals/rankeds.

inb4 'Riot doesn't want to enfore the meta' I know they don't, but it's not like it's a serious gamemode right? Plus, the meta is what the players make of it, the current meta is pretty stable, so I don't see how this would be a problem.

TL;DR: Make a gamemode where each member of the team gets assigned a random role and champ BUT within the current meta, making teamfight practice alot more realistic.

Would love to hear all arguments in favor or against my idea, all I know is that I would play this a whole lot more then the current 'get lucky in picks and win' ARAM

Ps: Yes, I know games outside of the meta are being played in rankeds aswell as in the pro circuit but you unfortunately cannot count in every random team comp out there.

EDIT: perhaps there could even be a gamemode besides this one in wich you pre-choose you role and the game then matches you with 4 others, who each have picked another role. In that way, you could practice by example, positioning/orbwalking as an ADC. Or initiating as the tanky top.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

My alienware M14x broke down earlier (spilled drink over it) and I'm looking for a laptop to replace it. I don't want to spend 1500 euro on a laptop again, but I still want one that does very good performance wise, at the same level or better then my previous one.

Here are the specs on my late m14x:
-8.192 MB 1.600 MHz Dual Channel DDR3 SDRAM [2 x 4.096]

-3 GB NVIDIA GeForce GT555M


-750 GB (7.200 rpm) serial ATA-hard drive


-Intel Core i7 Processor 2670QM (2,20 GHz, 6 MB cache, Quad Core)


This is the one I was looking at: http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/pdet.to?poid=2000098506$

Would this one suffice? Is Toshiba any good/know for gaming laptops? And please, any further suggestions are welcome! My pricerange is anywhere between 1000 and 1200 euro.

Thank you! </TEXT>

Aphro however, might be more mechanical (when het gets back to his old level, he's a bit sloppy now) and has more experience playing with a pro team on stages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably way too late for the party again but here it goes anyway:

When I was little, about 8 or so, I lived by the coast of Belgium (still do) A coasttram would drive along the coast in loops, stopping in all cities. Now, this thing drives in a bedding between the 2 roads the follow the same route, so naturally, alot of people cross it daily. There have been accidents before but they're pretty noisy so you can hear them coming wich gives you quite some time (they don't tend to go fast).

That day, I was on my way to the store when an eldery couple ok bikes wanted to cross the tracks. A tram was coming but they still had more then enough time. The man went first and got over just fine. His woman was next and the tram was getting pretty close now. 
She fell because her front wheel got stuck in the tracks. Being old and less mobile, she couldn't get up in time. 
The tram was too close to come to a standstill and ran her over at maybe 15 kmph but still, it was enough to run her over and drag her for a meter or 10. I watched it all in what seems like a slow-motion and stood there untill an ambulance showed up and put a tent over her remains. Needless to say, it wasn't a pretty sight.

Ps: sorry for bad formatting, on my phone </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drive over the speed limit on highways. Quite a bit, here the limit is 120km/h, left lane usually goes around 130-140 but whenever it's 'safe' to do so, meaning I have the space, I set my cruise control anywhere between 160 and 180, depending on traffic, 200+ at night when the road's totally empty. 
I guess I do it because I like to go places fast and believe 120 is way too slow, look at Germany, simular sized roads have no speed regulation at all (or 250..)

TL,DR: driving fast on highways, 120 km/h is bs </TEXT>

Plus, it's bronze and you're climbing really fast, these people have basically a 0% chance to ever play with you again so for them, it's one game where they're either on the right or the wrong side.

And to be fair, I'm in gold and would love a game where I get stomped by someone of your level just to see where all my mistakes lie.. Seriously, keep it up, do whatever you feel like doing and fuck us, Reddit will always find a way to disagree! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need a new gaming laptop after M14x broke. (1600) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-07 15:08:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,

I manged to spill half a glass of red vodka on my laptop the other night and it's basically dead now. It was an Alienware M14x with pretty decent allround stats, bought for 1600-ish. Now, I'm going to send it back to Dell and ask if they can fix it and if now, if they can just replace the broken parts or give me a discount if I buy the same one since there's probably parts in that that work just fine.

In case this doesn't work for whatever reason, I would like some suggestions for a new one, with about the same specs or better but perhaps for a cheaper price because I know Alienwares are expensive.

Stats I had now:
Windows 7 Home Edition
500GB 7,200 RPM SATA + 32GB mSATA Caching SSD 
8GB (2 X 4GB) Dual Channel DDR3 at 1600MHz
and a 6GB Nvidia card (forgot exactly wich one it was)

All suggestions are welcome! Thank you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I'm looking for a (if possible) Steam  racing game. It has to have an open world and preferably a large collection of excisting supercars in wich you can cruise around. I don't really like racing other people or AI itself, just would love to just drive the cars. Bonus points is if's not needed to grind points/cash for hours before you get your first decent car.

I looked for a game like this and found TDU2. Is this the right game for me? Or other suggestions? Thanks alot!

Ps: I know it's weird to want a racing game without having to do alot of racing itself but I remember I just loved to drive in GTA with the faster cars. This is what I'm looking for now, only more realistic and perhaps less killing stuff :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Often our team will be destroyed when an opposing Katarina is fed, I main adc and feel like there's little to nothing I can do to stop that single-handed. Is there anything I can do?

2. In most of my games I win my lane pretty convincingly but after that it feels like it's up to the team wether we win or not because often teammates lose their lane and I'm not good enough to carry by myself. As long as they don't lose, we tend to win but if they lose their I often get dived 1st thing in the teamfight by a 10-kill fed bruiser/assasin and get wrecked before I can deal dps. TLDR: How can I improve in 'carrying' my team more if I won my lane and they lost theirs? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Granted, I main adc and I don't really like him either but you got the whole 'league of draven' culture, he's know to shut down ezreal pretty hard. Then why is he hardly ever picked? Graves get counterpicked vs an ezreal way more often. Is it his lack of a reliable escape? What is it about him or his kit that makes him less viable then others. Thanks!

Tl;Dr: What does Draven need in order to become a vast pick? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-01-19 15:48:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Would love to hear some opinions about this because I have pulled this trick aswell when I was younger, claiming I was sick to skip school or for whatever reason. The doctor usually came by and always declared me sick for a few days after heaving heard me symptoms and doing a brief check. Now I wonder if they knew I was faking but just played along (they got payed anyhow..) or because it's out of safety 'what if he really is sick, I don't notice it and something bad happens.

Hope this explanation makes sense, english is not my native language. Thanks for the replies!

EDIT: Holy.. Front page, thank you all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I once was home alone and gaming with my headset on, about 1 am,  volume pretty loud. Suddently tought I heard a noise coming from downstairs but I tought it was nothing (we have 2 cats aswell, they tend to make some noises now and then) but the, after about a minute, heard it again.
So I put off my headset, listened carefully and aboutt 5 seconds later heard glass breaking. My first tought was still, bloody cats, bumping glass off tables. Went downstairs without turning on lights in the hallway and when I get downstairs I can see trought the living room window 2 guys, each with rocks, throwing in the glass kitchen door.
Sneak upstairs while calling the police, telling them very briefly what's going on, taking my dad's katana he keeps next to his bed and go downstairs again. Now they do see me as I enter the living room and flee. Cops then arrived, made a report but were not too happy about me getting the sword and going downstairs again. 
What I can understand, at that moment tough, I was so angry because I envisioned not me (21y old male) but one of my little sisters being home alone and them breaking in that I was enfuriated. Sorry for the wall of text

**TL; DR: Was gaming,heard noises, tought it was cats, turned out to be burglars trying to smash in the kitchen window.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it had to be when I saw this kid, must of been like 12 or something, come out of the store with his dad holding a pack of cookies. He looked really happy with them. Then he saw a homeless guy and his dog sitting near the entrance of the shop. 
He stopped, hesitated for a second and then went up the guy, giving him his cookies. He also asked if he could pet the dog, I could see the dad wasn't to excited about that but let him proceed. He then walked away with an even bigger smile, as if he knew what he had just done was nicer then wat I'de say 75% of adults would ever do.
Really brightened up my day. </TEXT>

I believe most of you are well aware of some of the stereotypes the rest of the world has about the United States of America. I would like to hear your point of view about these things and what you think about them! 
Also, people who visited the US, what surprised you? What did you except to be completly different?

<TEXT> Hi,
So I recently upgraded to iTunes 11. Everything went great for a day or 2 but ever since then, iTunes just doensn't open anymore. I tried everything, re-installing, opening as admin, giving priority, deleted iTunes and all sub-components, cleaned registries and reinstalled. Same problem tough, just doesn't want to open..

When I try to launch it and have task manager open, it actually shows up in the list of processes, only to dissapear after a second or 5, never showing the iTunes screen or pictogram in the system bar. 
Could anyone help me please? Thanks alot!!

Info: I run Windows 7 64 bit, any other information needed, just ask! Cheers </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just my toughts on the new Idra.. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-05 00:40:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> No need to upvote, just wanted to tell this..

Important: I'm not a native english speaker and I will try to make this nuanced as possible.

IHonestly, 've wasn't a huge fan of Idra, he was once one of the best zergs out there but then eventually just got passed by others. Nothing bad there, but he kept his 'BM' behaviour and 'I'm the best out there attitude', something wich I tought was a pretty dumb thing to do with no results to back that up. I tough that he would just keep on sinking, trying to survive on the name he once made for himself. 

Now, I must say tough, I was really impressed the last few times I've seen him play on stage, he seems to have really dedicated himself on reaching the top level again. Wich was partially what made me open his stream this evening when I was bored. There, I was pleasently surprised, I found a well-playing Idra, explaing his tactics to his viewers, interacting and not calling people bad every 5 seconds. I really enjoyed it and even felt bad for him and the other viewers when he had to stop streaming because someone tought it would be funny to do the Clan Invite glitch thing.

Just an honest story I wanted to get out there.

TLDR: Idra improved and cleaned up his act imo, best of luck for him in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

I used to have an iPhone 4s and all push notifications (Facebook, Twitter, Skype etc..) were delivered instantly to my phone. Same thing goes for my mails. I recently bought an iPhone 5 and made it a copy of my 4s but push notifcations come in with a great delay or not at all, untill I open the app. I also noticed I'm being logged out of apps more often.
Does anyone have an idea how to fix this? Make the notifications/messages/mails instant again? Because this is rather annoying. Thanks alot!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this would be a gread addition because I believe lesser known streams will have a higher chance of attractiong new viewers. Say for example, I main ADC so that's what I prefer to watch. Now, none of the 'big ADC names' is streaming, what I usually do is watch someone else 'famous', wether he plays my role or not.

Now, if this were to be added, I might click a guy I never heard of before just because I'de like to learn from him, and when I like him, I'll probably come back.
So, this will, in my opinion, give more exposure to the lesser known streamers. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a troll question, recently played a bot game again after a long time and I was surprised they still are retarded when it comes to lane mate. I made a team with me as Graves and then Sona, Warwick, Malazhar and Garen I believe. You would assume me both with Sona, WW jungle (but since bots don't 'jungle', him top with garen), and Malazhar mid.
Now, what happens when I start the game, I see Sona run top with Warwick, Malazhar bot with Garen leaving the mid lane for me.
Now my question, is it really that hard to make bots have some sense of awereness of where to go? I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed this..

TLDR; Bot games are meant to learn noobs how to play but how can they when they don't come near real game compositions? Is it so hard to learn bots where to go? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is heal noob? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-20 17:08:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Allright, first of all, I haven't been playing this game for too long now (level 20-ish) and usually play AD carry (graves, ezreal, teemo etc..) Since the beginning I've been playing with first heal-ghost and later heal-flash as soon as I had it. Now, lately more and more people told me to switch heal for ignite. Granted, almost everyone runs ignite these days. But for me, it just doesn't seem right; I feel like as if heal helped me out loads more in games then ignite. And there are so many close call situations in wich I tough, if only i had me heal there instead of ignite. A feeling I hardly get the other way around..

Now, my question is, is it really that bad to run heal? Should I just keep using ignite till I get used to it? Thanks alot! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said that drugs and gaming are the same thing, drugs are bad, very bad, they destroy people's life so often while gaming is entertainment, so many people enjoy it. How could it be the same? Well, it can destroy lives aswell, believe me. Not in the way drugs do but in more subtile forms, you start to ignore the ones you love, they get frustrated.. You become unhealthy, hardly see people.. This of course will not happen when you are a casual gamer and there is nothing wrong with that, I cannot stress that enough. But there are times where it goes way beyond that, where you really need professional help in order to get way from it's grip.

This seems very weird to alot of people because they assume you can just 'stop gaming' and it's 'lack of self control'. Well, you can just 'stop drinking' too right? No.. Gaming does not indeed reward you in a fysical or material way like drug or alcohol do but sometimes, with certrain people, the rush of winning, the feeling that it gives, can be just as addicting as gambling I am sure. I'm not the worst case by far, I've seen people in the clinic go bonkers because they were denied internet access. 

I understand that all this must seems really weird for outsiders, incomprehensable even, but let me assure you, it can be really bad and it is in fact, considered a legitimate addiction by authoroties and such. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say that before anything, just like with every other addiction, you have to realise yourself that you spend way too much time on computers and need to stop. If not, nothing or nobody can help. Once you realised this it's best to seek professional advice, they will explain everything to you and then it's up to you wether to decide if you want help or not. Just one more thing, don't think 'I'm going to calm down on gaming, going to game less.' No. Just, NO. That doesn't work, you have to quit everything, cold turkey and try to last as long as possible. Because if you play 'a bit' you'll fall back into old patters before you know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are alot of people who think the same as you, so did I actually. But it had been proven that you can actually be addicted to internet usage or gaming in the same way that you're addicted to by example drugs or alcohol. I went to a clinic in Holland (there aren't any (good) ones in Belgium who are specialised in this matter) where they only treat this kind of addiction, there they diagnosed me and offered to treat me but i didn't want to be internated, I wanted to get over it on my own, with the help of my doctor and parents. So far, it seems to have worked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the feeling all too well. I think something along those lines would have applied to me aswell. Luckely, I liked sleep too much to actually get up early to game wich kept me atleast a bit healthy but still, it was pretty bad from time to time. There were weeks in the winter where I realised I haven't seen the sun in days, I was basically living during nightime and blocked out the little sun there was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I have, and I actually did. This was on my old laptop, instead of removing everything I bough a new one (an Alienware, stupid me) and told myself I wouln't install games anymore. This lasted for maybe 3 days and made me realise afterwards that I indeed have a problem.

No, I never got to GM but I've been Top-8 Masters frequently, I think I played too much CoD to actually get promoted (I was #1 5v5 in the esl for almost a year, this made me some money in online tournaments but this was more bad then good, since I used it as an excuse to keep playign since 'I made money with it') </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't exactly how or what made me realise I was addicted but suddently I started seeing that the people around me were right and I was actually spending way too much time gaming and on the internet and I decided that this is not the life I wanted to live. So I packed my bags and went to France for the entire summer with a few mates, spent our days surfing and such but I tried to refrain myself form any form of internet usage. When I got back I forced myself to stay away from the PC as much as possible and that's a battle with myself I still have to fight every day. And like I said, I started working, travel as much as possible, mostly for surfing. And the biggest thing probably, I found a girlfriend who lives a simular lifestyle, alot of travelling and such and that keeps me away from falling back into old habits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to tell to what degree since I always refused any kind of treatment or professional help. In the beginning because I tough I wasn't addicted at all, afterwards because I wanted to stop on my own. But it was pretty bad, I would wake up and start gaming just about untill I went to bed, the only thing I would do besides that was go out with friends or see my girlfriend, no classes, nothing. So I don't really know, pretty bad but not bad enough for me not to want personal contact anymore, or see my friend. 
For the 2nd part of the question, yes, I have experienced pain in my wrists (CoD and Sc2 aren't the most kind games for them) but they seem to have dissapeared now, thank God. </TEXT>
