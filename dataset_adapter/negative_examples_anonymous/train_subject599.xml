<TEXT> No, it's not far from Houston, but it's very rural, and the populace isn't super friendly to outsiders or government representatives. Worked with a guy who grew up in Houston, but has a lot of family in Liberty County, he hated visiting them because they always treated him like he didn't belong around them. Also, a couple years ago there were some stories about three men who, in separate incidents, went missing in Liberty County with little to no evidence left behind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first episode I ever caught on the radio was Episode 83, "One of Us," I was living in central Wisconsin and had just finished doing laundry. At the time, TAL was not on Wisconsin Public Radio, but a little public radio station in Rhinelander was playing it, the first show hooked me. The show has changed over the almost 20 years that I've listened to it, but I still make sure to catch every new episode and rarely is there one that doesn't entertain or inform me. I do find myself missing (nostalgic for) many of the early contributors like Vowell, Savage, Rakoff (RIP), Dishwasher Pete, Carrier, Sedaris, Rothbart, Kine, etc. .  . . I think in those earlier days, the show was winging it a bit more, was a bit more outsider (especially for NPR in the 90s), and, let's face it, it was shiny and new. I always love it when they repeat one of those early shows. The show has matured (so have I, I think), it is different from when I first heard it, but that, in my opinion, is neither a good thing nor a bad thing. I'll stop rambling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all they are kittens, so they have a lot of energy, and probably do get a little bored of each other and want to include you - as they age, this won't happen as much.  Second, cats are fairly nocturnal, one vet told me that she closes her bedroom door at night and lets her cats have run of the rest of the house so that she can get undisturbed sleep.

One trick that I've used is that when a cat wakes me, I pull all hands, feet, arms, sometimes even my head under the covers. I have three that are all adults and, for the most, part let me sleep. One loves her treats in the morning so she'll bug me a bit closer to my normal wake up time (she also likes to sleep on top of me, which usually doesn't wake me up these days). </TEXT>

<TEXT> For New York City, as well as many old US cities like Chicago, a period from sometime in the 1960s through the early 1990s could be referred to as an era of [Crime and Grime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdDUmvPK2OM) A very significant year for NYC was 1977 - The Bronx is Burning, Son of Sam, the July blackout, etc. In fact, there's a pretty cool documentary called [NY77: The Coolest Year in Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHXAYddPLsM) that I highly recommend. It looks at the problems facing NYC, but also the music scene of punk rock, early rap, and disco.

Anyway, in 1994, Rudy Giuliani took over the mayor's office and installed Bill Bratton as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, Bratton pushed the "broken windows" concept of policing, which had a heavy focus on punishing quality of life crimes. Trains were cleaned up, a lot of graffiti was cleaned up, more effort to pick up trash, and gentrification was encouraged. Times Square went from a place full of prostitutes, adult movie theaters, and drug dealers to a place with a giant Disney Store.

The NYC depicted in Mr. Robot is not nearly as clean as it is now, the streets are safer in the real NYC, and, Elliot would have trouble affording an apartment on his own, even in Chinatown. That being said, if you've ever watched Gotham on Fox, that really is a NYC stuck firmly in the crime and grime era.

EDIT: TL;DR: Mayor Giuliani really cleaned up NYC to the point that it is much cleaner, safer than as depicted in Mr. Robot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cruz only cares about playing to the most extreme right of the right-wing portion of the GOP. He doesn't care about what the majority wants, he doesn't care about what anyone who didn't vote for him wants, and he doesn't care about anyone who disagrees with him.

SOURCE: I live in Texas, and Cruz doesn't care about my political views or ideas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will say this, there is a two-faced element to Lakewood Church. The main services have that feel good, be rewarded, yada yada yada tone, but I've gotten the impression that the bible studies and other small group things at Lakewood do have a more evangelical tone to them. I knew a guy who started going there, became an usher, started going to bible study for men classes and turned into one of those guys who, like Orthodox Jews and extremist Muslims, got mad at women for not dressing modestly, it was their fault for tempting him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I call it a quirk, because I spent a few years living and practicing law in Wisconsin where there are limitations/requirements concerning what specific county can issue your marriage license. For example, if I'm a resident of Wisconsin and I want to get a marriage license from Milwaukee County, I or my fianc had to live in Milwaukee County for at least 30 days. People who don't live in Wisconsin but want to get married there, say in Bayfield (which is very lovely during summer) have to get their marriage license from Bayfield County. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Each state has its own laws regarding marriage (heavily tied to property law), but, states cannot enact and enforce laws that violate the Constitution. The marriage issue isn't new territory for the Supreme Court, in 1967 the Court issued a decision in Loving v. Virginia stating that state laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional.
I haven't read the full majority Opinion, so don't know if this was an issue in the outcome, but one major problem I have had with state laws that ban same sex marriage is that they also said the state did not have to recognize such a marriage that took place in a state where same sex marriage was legal. To me this goes completely against full faith and credit, which I view as a building block of our legal system. </TEXT>

(Just as an interesting aside, there is a quirk in Texas law that allows you to get a marriage license from a county that you don't live in nor do you plan to marry in. I have friends who live in Harris but got their licenses in Fort Bend because it is a "prettier" looking license.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Cherry Sisters were a Vaudeville act, consisting of real life sisters, who performed music, poetry, readings, fake hypnosis, and other artistic expressions. Audiences found the group devoid of talent and would yell at group and throw fruit and vegetables at the Cherry Sisters during their performances, and yet the group continued to tour and perform. Were they precursors to comedians like Andy Kaufman or were they really talentless? </TEXT>

But it is good that their efforts to fight against what is right are futile because there are counties in Texas issuing licenses to same sex couples, and you can get a license from a county even if you don't live in the county and you don't plan to get married in that county. </TEXT>

And, LGBT people want to get married to be happy, to promote love for each other - nobody wants to start their marriage by trying to force someone to perform the marriage ceremony, weddings are about good memories, not shitty memories. </TEXT>

Have heard a little thunder, but not much. Bill only came ashore between 11:00 a.m and noon, it's taken some time for its eastern feeder bands to catch up, but it seems like they have and will stick around overnight. </TEXT>

The only LEO in Houston I've seen with a decal saying it was confiscated was a really beat old Ford F150, I actually felt bad for the Constable who had to drive it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not trying to incite outrage. In the past, there have been discussion about whether or not a certain vehicle someone has seen was LEO. A lot of people are under the misconception that all LEO vehicles in Texas have "Exempt" plates, I've always maintained that is not the case, and I'm posting this picture so as to educate people here on the issue. I actually went downtown to get pictures for /r/policevehicles - and happened to see this one parked in the Harris County fleet fuel depot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've listened to NPR since the late 1980s, and haven't felt any burn out. But, I don't listen to it exclusively. In the mornings I mix my Morning Edition with local sports talk radio and sometimes Howard Stern. During the middle of the day I listen to podcasts of my favorite NPR shows or stream the music oriented WFUV out of The Bronx. I love ATC and Marketplace in the late afternoons and on the drive home. Compared to most other news media out there, NPR still serves up better news coverage of national events and world events. The other "news" radio station in Houston is just a delivery vehicle for Fox. </TEXT>

They (or their taxidermist) can possess and sell a gallbladder (often with license/permit) attached only to those licensed to buy gallbladders. I get the impression that a lot of licensed bear hunters just destroy the gallbladder at the site of the kill so as not to accidentally run afoul of the laws. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My BIG request for Season 4 of OITNB - A Native American Inmate (or more) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-13 16:59:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The federal government has major crimes jurisdiction over Indian Reservations in non-PL 280 States (though there are exceptions). I remember one Native American activist (probably Russell Means or John Trudell, or could have been Leonard Peltier) saying that the federal correction system is the biggest Indian Reservation in the United States. Litchfield is part of the federal system so while it could get Natives from any Rez across the country, there are several nearby in New York and New England. I'm pretty certain that there are way more Native males in the system than Native females, but, plenty of Native women end up behind bars for the same reasons the current inmates of Litchfield are there. I've done a little work on accommodating the religious needs of Native inmates, and I'd just like to see OITNB address, even to a slight degree, the existence of Natives in the federal system.

EDIT: TL;DR - Because of Federal Jurisdictional Issues, OITNB should have Native American prisoners. </TEXT>

This is a real life example of a 14 year old girl who is sentenced to an adult maximum security prison in Florida. Did you listen to the story? If not, I highly recommend it. I disabled the auto play feature, because that is annoying if you're not ready for it. Use the audio button in the second box, the Act 2 box. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In football and baseball the defenses and offenses operate in such a way that time is needed to rearrange the players on the field (in a way, baseball really doesn't have the same kind of timeouts that exist in other major US sports, it's a slow game and the manager isn't limited to how many times he can go to the mound, they are trying to limit how often the batter can step out of the box.) In other sports, the time outs allotted to each time are used for tactical reasons. But, in general, the bulk of stoppage in play is for television or for review of officiating calls.

Edit: Television takes full advantage of the time needed to rearrange players on the field in football and baseball, and the league officials won't mess with that because television contracts are big source of revenue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FIFA isn't involved in the Olympics bid process, the entity in charge of the Olympics is the IOC. That being said, the IOC is far from squeaky clean. In particular, former IOC President (1980-2001) Juan Antonio Samaranch, was a member of the Franco regime in Spain. The IOC doesn't get as much attention as FIFA because, even though the World Cup finals is every four years, FIFA plays a much bigger role in the operation of soccer than the IOC does in the variety of sports that make up the Olympics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From: https://www.ridemetro.org/SafetySecurity/MPD/FAQs.aspx

Q: Do officers of the METRO Police Department have the same authority as Houston Police Department officers? 
A: Yes, the METRO Police Officers have the same law enforcement authority as other licensed peace officers in the State of Texas, including Houston Police Department officers.

Q: What is the jurisdiction of the METRO Police Department?
A: The jurisdiction of the METRO Police Department is defined as any part of the county in which the 1 cent METRO sales tax is collected. This area spans approximately 1,285 square-miles, which includes most of Harris County and portions of Montgomery, Fort Bend, and Waller Counties. The METRO service area crosses several political jurisdictions and METRO Police has concurrent jurisdiction with those police agencies. However, the METRO Police Department is the primary police agency whenever an incident occurs on METRO property, such as bus stops/shelters, METRORail platforms, Park   Ride lots, transit centers, buses, and light rail vehicles. METRO Police also has primary jurisdiction of the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) network, as well as other right-of-ways or locations where transit-related incidents occur.

Q: What types of crime does the MPD investigate?
A: MPD investigates all crime occurring on METRO property or right-of-ways (see above). METRO Police also act on information received from Crime Stoppers and individuals who report criminal activity observed on METRO property or right-of-ways.

First of all, I know I live in an area that can get ravaged by weather and federal relief is important in our recovery from those incidents. Second, just cause I am a Texan doesn't make me an island unto myself - not only do I have a lot of family and friends who live in the areas hit by Sandy, but as an American I don't like seeing other Americans suffering as a result of natural disasters and I don't like seeing a-hole politicians play politics while other Americans are suffering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sting has more to do with marketing related bribes and kickbacks involving CONCACAF officials and marketing companies, such as Traffic. Much of this seems to be connected to tv and radio rights for matches and tournaments, including the 2014 World Cup.

Since CONCACAF is headquartered in Miami, the US has jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for the law enforcement authorities of different countries to work together. The fact that the Swiss authorities were willing to assist the US indicates just how fed up they are with FIFA in general.

As to why now - my understanding is that certain statutes of limitations were on the verge of expiring.

FIFA doesn't like governmental interference into its secret lairs. I've seen speculation that if Blatter wanted, he could suspend all of CONCACAF and take away the World Cup slots. Not sure how accurate this is, and not sure that FIFA would want to grab the bull by the horns like that.

I think DOJ's endgame is to root out corruption in CONCACAF and hold the sleazy folks that have been in charge accountable for their misdeeds.

What happened today isn't about the 2018   2022 World Cup bidding processes; however, the Swiss government has launched its own criminal proceedings into those matters. </TEXT>

That's the light hearted side, the dark side is how many people get ticketed or arrested on flimsy evidence that wouldn't hold up at trial but can't hire good legal help so take pleas cause it seems easier   quicker than fighting,   then find themselves f'd financially.

<TEXT> This isn't just a problem in the realm of truancy, it is a problem for a lot of low income people who get cited for various minor "quality of life" misdemeanors - loitering, public intoxication, being in a park after it has closed, etc. They get caught in a vicious circle of missing work due to arrest and court, already living paycheck to paycheck so can't pay fine, more court, maybe more jail, more work missed, there goes the job, etc. etc. etc. One of the big reasons that the federal judge shot down "stop and frisk" in the NYC public housing scenario was partly due to this happening to people who had no weapon and ended up getting summonses related to "quality of life" issues. The lead plaintiff in that case was arrested for trespassing at a public housing unit - he was waiting for his girlfriend who lived there and gave him permission to be there. The guy is a licensed security guard and the flimsy arrest, even without a conviction, could have seriously ruined his career. </TEXT>

I will say one thing that can be annoying here in Houston is how all the private security companies now have fleets of cars that look like police cars. Additionally, there are at least three communities (two very wealthy neighborhoods and one a commercial district) that hire off-duty LEO to patrol in vehicles those communities have furnished - and they seem to replace the cars more often than HPD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NPR interviewed Jules Feiffer yesterday and he said the following: 

"Well, I've had endless acts because I ran out of steam on one thing, because life happened on another thing, and I developed a resourcefulness ... where I would just look around for some other way to do what I wanted to do. If it happens too fast, you don't build these, what I used to call these "rejection deltoids," where you are so used to being hit in the face that you just get up again automatically. The kids who were successful in high school from the beginning didn't know how to do that. So they would take a couple of slaps and they'd go into their father's business."

We all need to learn to cope when life slaps us around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wanted to say I really enjoy the show. As someone who has always had an interest in the history of Colonial America and the Revolution it's been frustrating how little play the Revolution has had in popular culture. I know at one point, there were more movies about the French and Indian War than about the Revolution - I guess the turn (no pun intended) came with Mel Gibson's Patriot. Now, in the Fall I have Sleepy Hollow and it's fun with the Revolution and then in the Spring I get the more serious, but still entertaining, Turn. </TEXT>

Woodfield tried to establish himself with the Packers during Coach and General Manager Dan Devine's last season but he could not shake his problems with a trip across the country. He signed a contract in February 1974 but was cut during training camp, failing to make the team's final roster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can't believe this bs still happens at Baylor. I know it isn't as bad as the decades before I was at Baylor, but still annoys me. Back in the 1990s, my girlfriend was at UT and I typically drove down to Austin every weekend and would crash in her room at Jester. It was a coed floor, so no big deal there. By 2nd year at Baylor I was living at The Centre and various girlfriends of myself and my roommates were always staying over - some practically seemed to live there for periods. We never gave a f about the moral rules or what ever Baylor Admin calls them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My policy is to use the article's actual title (or at least the suggest title button) whenever possible.  That being said, it is important for everyone to recognize that the headline, or article title, is typically (and historically) written by a copywriter and not the author of the actual article. Considering how newspapers have historically written headlines so as to grab a reader's attention and get the reader to read the article, I feel there has been a little too much handwringing on the internet over "click-bait" lately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good question. I assume there is a cost aspect (cost of purchase and cost of maintenance) combined with how the vehicle is going to be used. I assume that a Fusion is cheaper than the Ford Police Interceptor/Chevy Caprice PPV/Dodge Charger and in midtown they really don't need a lot of patrol cars with big engines. As for nontraditional cars, I did see a NYPD Chevrolet Volt, but was not able to get a picture of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The title is a bit misleading. Filming the police is protected by the First Amendment, States cannot legislate around the First Amendment. However, courts do maintain that those filming the police cannot interfere with the police, leaving open what exactly is interfering with police. It appears that this bill is attempting to do that by setting a 100 foot distance requirement. That being said, I think 100 feet is a bit much and I do not support this bill. </TEXT>
