<TITLE> How do I get my girlfriend to keep on taking her antidepressants? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-11 00:32:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some background, she was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety back in April but only started taking the medication near the end of it. This was during school and we lived on campus so to keep her in check with her dosages she had a campus counselor and we saw results with the exceptions of a couple of episodes that happened circumstantially 

Now it's summer, I'm back in college for summer session while she's back at home with her parents. She quit the medication cold turkey after she was diagnosed with a viral infection and was afraid of mixing her antidepressants (Prozac i believe) and other stuff she was taking. After three weeks she went back on it after reading the consequences online but only a couple of days after that she would refuse to take it or even fib about having took it. I'm about 6 hours away so being there is out of the question. How should I go about this kind of situation? </TEXT>

supposedly we have more options for delivery which include McDonalds, Taco Bell and some other stuff.  I'm sure very few people tried this service since all the stores only have one available delivery date which is monday 9-6 or something like that.  How long was this a thing?  And if you're the few that ordered before how was that experience? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I say just cover the game as a whole like what makes this particular smash different overall, make brief comparisons to other smash games it shares similarities to and maybe even game feel/speed/etc? I feel like you could do that for all iterations of smash games and give the newcomers who don't doesn't know the difference between each iteration a brief overview of what the composition of that particular smash game is. Not sure if I made sense there but hopefully you got the gist of it haha </TEXT>

If anything it's another flavor of smash to play, not everyone's cup of tea but it's something.  And if nintendo is really pushing forth this whole ideal of bridging the smash community I would bet that patches are going to be a very prevalent part of this game.  </TEXT>
