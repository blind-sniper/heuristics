<TEXT> The track is 133.75 feet long and 6.1 feet high.  If a real roller coaster is about 100 feet high, then this roller coaster at 1/16 scale would be 2,192 feet long.  If it was 200 feet high, then at 1/33 scale it would be 4,458 feet long. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I dislike surprises, anyone else? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-13 06:03:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't like surprise parties whether it's for me or for someone else.  I enjoy mysteries, such as something unknown to me that will definitely happen on an expected date, but I don't think it's fun when others purposely hide something from you.

I also dislike when someone says "I have something to tell you!"  Again, this is witholding information when they could just tell you.  I always like to stay informed...

I'm all for the suprises and adventures of everyday life but I don't think it's enjoyable when someone is plotting something to surprise you with, especially if both the information and timing is unexpected and especially if they expect you to react in a certain way.

Maybe INTJs just like to be in control or aware of situations as much as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got to play the 3rd one thru night 5 with no information.  That was special.

However I will never forget the first time I played FNAF 1.  I had heard about it online but wanted to give it a shot.  I got my siblings and cousins together, who had never heard of it, and sat them in the basement watching me on the iPad.  We all screamed and jumped when Bonny showed up at the door for the first time.  

Over the next few days we took turns playing to see if we could make it through to night 5.  I think we got to 4.

Anyway play it with friends, makes it more fun and less scary!  Also you can turn the sound down when you don't want the jumpscares to be so intense. </TEXT>

Anyway some more things to look into:

- flashing Freddy eyes (morse code/binary?)

- Animatronic glitch timing (morse code/binary?)

- the static between games

- Weird static/distortion that follows you when you turn your head in the office - watch the pixels on the desk

Keep up the good work </TEXT>

<TITLE> Wrote a final paper on Frankenstein and FNAF. Got an 86% </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-19 05:57:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Thought you guys might like this!

I'm a junior (third year) at college and I wrote my analysis paper on Five Nights at Freddy's.  My teacher said she never had a student include a video game as a source before but for some reason she let me do it.

If you're going to read it I have to add that the college is a private Christian school so naturally there's several biblical allusions.  Also, it's not perfect and there are some mistakes.

Here's a link: http://www.docdroid.net/10rk1/fnaf-paper.pdf.html

Student Readers Summary:  In the original order, man is above all creation but falls short of divinity.  Frankenstein portrays a terrifying farce in which this order is disrupted and man creates new life.  5.N.A.F. tells a similar story in which robots are animated via dead children.  Both stories horrify because even the most successful attempts at creating life fall terribly short, and offend the humanity of the audiences.  We are not the sources of life, and in fact need God to supply our own life.  

TL;DR:  Humans are incapable of creating anything greater than or equal to themselves, and any living thing created solely with human hands is doomed to be a monster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I once made a movie, rather tongue-in-cheek, called Psycho. The content was, I felt, rather amusing and it was a big joke. I was horrified to find some people took it seriously. It was intended to make people scream and yell and so forthbut no more than screaming and yelling on a switchback railway (rollercoaster). I'm possibly in some respects the man who says in constructing it, 'how steep can we make the first dip?' If you make the dip too deep, the screams will continue as the car goes over the edge and destroys everyone. Therefore you mustn't go too far because you do want them to get off the switchback railway, giggling with pleasure." - Alfred Hitchcock in a 1964 interview </TEXT>

<TEXT> Start small and work your way up!  Also, keep your eyes open and relax.  If you want a less intense ride, sit in the middle of the train as the front will go faster into hills and the back will get pulled over the hills faster.

I've ridden every coaster at Cedar Point except for Jr. Gemini and they are all great.  Pretty sure everyone here can give you lots of information on the park if you need it.  Try the wooden roller coasters first; they are less sickening than Corkscrew or Gatekeeper or Mantis (rougarou) because the transitions are less intense.

I actually puked last time I went to cedar point because I rode the Skyhawk swing ride twice after breakfast.  Sudden acceleration and deceleration on a full stomach is dangerous... So take time to digest, haha.

What was the roller coaster you puked on? </TEXT>

<TEXT> How long can you survive in FNAF without dying?  Start with a new game file and work your way up from the beginning.  Continue to night 6 and 7 if you make it that far!

My personal record on mobile is Night 6, 2 AM.

If someone was able to complete all 7 levels in one go that would really be something.  If this catches on we should keep a High Score list on the side of the sub for FNAF 1, 2, and 3 on PC and mobile. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking about this today.  In the first game, the animatronics get directly in your face only when you die.  In the second game, the old ones are in front of your face almost every time you put down the monitor, and in the third one the hallucinations are always jumping right on you.  So the first one is the only one where there is the legitimate suspense of hoping to avoid that dreaded face to face encounter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that the final psychiatrist scene in Psycho is crucial, because it offers the audience the false hope of fully explaining the plot.  It gives the audience a chance to laugh at themselves and relax, convinced that the whole ordeal was simply an illusion... only to find themselves face to face with the gruesome reality after the psychologist is done.

Using Hitchcock's roller coaster metaphor, the entire movie is a ridiculous roller coaster that leaves the entire audience out of breath.  If you cut out the psychiatrist scene, you cut out the brake run and dump the audience off in the station before they've even got their wits back.  It would be like hitting a brick wall while going sixty miles an hour.  So the psychiatrist scene slowly brings the audience's energy from sixty miles an hour down to a slow crawling speed for a minute, and then gives them one last jerk as the train comes to a stop and we see Norman's face superimposed with the skull/car.

The same rules apply for movies and roller coasters: you want to push the boundaries as far as they can go, but you want to keep people reasonably comfortable in the process.  Unlike roller coasters, movies won't kill audiences if they are designed poorly, but it's important to remember that you never want to leave a bad taste in people's mouths.  While modern directors like to end a movie right when the audience is still on the edge of their seats (Nolan's Inception is a good example), I kind of admire the classic directors who were able to use their filmmaking power to efficiently guide an audience in and out of an intense movie.

Also, Hitchcock considered the psychiatrist scene one of his "icebox scenes".  His theory was that when moviegoers come home, they are inevitably going to grab some snacks from the fridge and talk about the movie for a bit.  This scene gives moviegoers something to talk about, or at least a springboard for understanding the rest of the movie.  It's the old "audiences are stupid" scene that Hitchcock was fond of; it explains the plot of the movie so that viewers can't complain afterwards about the its logic but can just talk about their favorite parts of the story.

If you think this scene really is bad let me know, but for me it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie because of the delicious irony of "modern" psychology attempting to explain what almost seems to border on the supernatural.  My non-film roommate enjoyed the movie and said afterwards, "Isn't it nice that they explain everything for you?"  I had to laugh because the scene hardly explains anything.  Other similar dissonant ending scenes would be the "isn't nature beautiful" helicopter ride at the end of Jurassic Park or the nonchalant "we've got top men working on it" government scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  These scenes tie up the pretty little bow of the story all too neatly, making the audience want to watch it again and get to the heart of what the movie was really about. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts on listening to RAM </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-28 07:14:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think the best way to listen to this album is exactly as the title suggests:  on random!

For some reason I get tired listening to the album in the proper order.  I simply expect and anticipate which song is coming next.  Partially because there is long silence between the songs.

However, putting it on random not only surprises me with which songs come on the stereo but also with how they sound.  Songs that I got used to after a long time sound fresh and different.

I like listening to their albums usually all the way straight through but with RAM I get tired of the general arc.  The album progresses from disco songs about the dance floor, loneliness, weariness, and sadness (the party lifestyle) to songs about hope, looking beyond, and rising above the world (the transcendent lifestyle).  At least that's the way I see it.  And it's a good arc, but it all seems divided right down the middle by "Touch" and I get the general flow of both sides of the record after a while.

So anyway for me putting it on random gives it a new spin.

I'd love to hear other people talk about how they listen to the music and what sort of themes they see in the different albums. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's hard to say if a film is rewatchable when it just came out last year.  How many times have you seen Captain America: Winter Soldier?  North by Northwest is my favorite rewatchable film personally and I've seen it about ten times.  My second favorite is Raiders of the Lost Ark and I've seen it about eight times.  It helps that those movies are from a long time ago, because any instant "cool" factor or shock value they could have had back then is long gone, leaving only the heart and integrity of the movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pulp Fiction doesn't rely entirely on the "wow" factor of intertwining stories, although most Christopher Nolan movies do.  I wish Christopher Nolan had more moments that were interesting in themselves, not just interesting in how they play into the rest of the movie.  For example, the toaster pastry scene in Pulp Fiction is very clever and something that you would have a hard time finding in a Christopher Nolan movie.  Nolan has a hard time just letting a moment relax by itself; even the neat hallway rotating scene in Inception is intercut with several other scenes to increase the "impact" in a very unnecessary way.

I feel like Nolan is a Sundance director on steroids.  He focuses mostly on characters and initial shock value to please his audience.  Thus his movies get a lot of buzz on release but have a harder time remaining relevant and enjoyable over time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For starters you should read the full chapter of "Autobiography of a Yogi" that Scott is quoting from.  I wonder if the words missing were omitted on purpose or were just garbled up in the static of the night 5 phone call.  Anyway the whole chapter is really interesting because it mentions how everything has a "life force" including metals and plants... perfect evil scientist material.  

I wonder if the purple Freddy suit is a metaphor for the Golden Freddy suit when it was/is inhabited by the purple man.  I'd imagine that he cannot dismantle or disarm the robots while in the suit and so he leaves it for greater mobility, speed, and motor skills.  The reason why he goes to the safe room is so that the robots will give up pursuit and turn around, giving him a chance to attack from behind.

The newspaper clippings from the first game are really interesting too, that's what got me started on the "mad scientist" theory.  Here was a post I made on the subject a while ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/2wh7qu/why_did_he_kill/

I want to beat the secret mini games for myself but I haven't done that yet.  I don't understand why giving the dead kids cake helps free them...  Every mini game takes place in the perspective of either a robot or a previously-robot dead kid, so it tells us how the robot characters see the world and interact with it.  Maybe the "glitches" represent some sort of supernatural transcendence... like the robots have to go to the underworld to save the kids or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the Night 5 secret call is helpful:  

"It is lamentable that mass agricultural development is not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory experiments... Countless uses will be made by future generations."  

So there's "potential" for these robots besides being basic animatronics.  

Maybe he takes the robots apart in the mini games because he feels guilty and afraid of his creations and hopes to put them to rest.  Unfortunately, the souls of the kids refuse to go away and he ironically is forced into the suit.

As for why the souls don't leave the animatronics, I think of the classic ghost cliche of improper burials and unnatural deaths leading to hauntings.  Think "Poltergeist" -- ghosts haunting a house because it has been built on their burial grounds.  So when he takes apart the animatronics, the animatronics are no longer coffins for the kids.  They are free, but in the "Bad Ending" they still haunt the area and only in the "Good Ending" are they free from Freddy Fazbear's.

As for how the marionette fits into all of it, you've got me beat. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why did he kill? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-19 22:59:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Everyone has been talking about WHO the killer is, but regardless of the killer's identity perhaps it is more important to ask WHY he killed the kids.

One possibility is revenge against the company.  Another possibility is that he is a psycho.  However, I think it is likely that the killer was attempting something beyond violence and horror.  

We've all seen real animatronics.  They are slow, clumsy, and artificial.  They are mechanical and impersonal.

What if you could create a human machine?  A robot with character?  What if you could give dead servos and metal beams a life?

Perhaps this is what the real killer was after.  They wanted to bring hope to a dismal restaurant.  They wanted to give the robots personality.  They wanted it to be a place where "fantasy and fun come to life".  

And what better to give a robot life than the soul of a child?  Curiosity, joy, energy...  It seems perfect.  And each kid would give his character some type of personality, and they would live forever.

<TITLE> Best album to play with FNAF </TITLE>

<TEXT> I don't care if you're waiting for the 3rd game to come out today.  Maybe you're trying to keep everything under control on the subreddit.  Whatever.

One of my favorite albums is Daft Punk's 2005 "Human After All".  Listen to it to make your Friday better. http://youtu.be/wh6Vh0xL0uI


How does this tie in to the game?

1. Human After All - Even if you don't think that the robots in the game are haunted, they have many human qualities gamers have attributed to them.  Curiosity, anger, loneliness, suspicion, playfulness... Do they actually have personalities or is it nothing more than basic programming personified by our imaginations?

2. Prime Time of Your Life - Several children have been cut down in the prime time of their lives at Freddy's Pizzeria.  Listen to how this song starts out slow and fun, but then accelerates into a ridiculous frenzy.  It is over before you fully appreciated it.

3. Robot Rock - Fun to hear the robot voice evolve over the course of this song from a guitar to a voice distinctly saying "Robot Rock".  You can imagine all the robots jamming out to this one on the show stage.

4. Steam Machine - There's no way that the company is good after everything that they've tried to hide.  Fazbear Entertainment is a ridiculous excuse for a corporation, and yet they keep plodding forwards, mechanically wiping everything out of their way.  At the end of the song, it sounds like the whispering voice says "Fear Machine" instead of "Steam Machine".

5. Make Love - Probably represents that weird part of the fandom.  Toy Chica... yeah, never mind.  But on a better note, maybe this relaxed song is about the parents trying to move on without their children and let it go.

6. The Brainwasher - Killer track.  Imagine those hallucinations getting more and more intense as the robots get closer... are they messing with your mind?

7. On/Off  - Sounds like switching a television on and off.  Minor glitch in the system.

8. Television Rules The Nation - Closed circuit television rules the pizzeria!  You are in charge, and somehow the robot's behavior is affected by which cameras you look at and when.  However, this could be the robot anthem against the security guard... you might think television rules the nation, but we'll see who's in charge at the end of the night.

9. Technologic - Shut it.  Wind it.  Switch it.  Find it.  Check it.  Close it.  Quick, replay it.

10. Emotion - Pretty much sums up the whole game.  Do the robots have feelings?  What do they think when the clock strikes 6-o-clock and they realize their robotic programming has made them kill someone?  What do they feel when they get back in their places as the sun rises?  Do the families come back to look at the restaurant and remember?


Anyway, thanks for reading.  Rock on and relax and remember how great the other 2 games have been. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen some of Kurt Vonnegut's simple structures and I really like them (Boy Meets Girl, Man in Hole, Cinderella).  Not sure if I should draw all of them in or what though.

Definitely going to include Campbell next time around, some other comments pointed out that Campbell and Vogler aren't the same like I thought they were.

Russian stuff is great too.  Never would have found that by myself, thanks.  And holy cow, that search engine is ridiculous.  

One of the reasons why I made this chart is because it shows you that one "structure" obviously doesn't have it all.  Learning from all of these and then borrowing what you can is great.  Personally, I think it's kind of hard writing from a formula, which is why I use this chart mostly for analyzing other stories and not when I'm writing my own.

I love what you said about vignettes/sequences.  If you think about it, you could shrink this whole chart down and then repeat it several times within a movie.  So we might have several separate quests within the overall journey and it will still be interesting to the audience </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know there's only a few interviews with Scott Cawthon out there, but what are your favorite quotes from him?

Here's mine from the IGM interview, Scott is responding to why the animatronics in the game rarely move:  "Thats one of the things that makes these 'creatures' so scary in real life. If youve ever been to an animatronic show at a theme park or a restaurant, they can be creepy when they move, sure. But its when they are turned off that the veil is lifted, and you realize that they were never alive. They are, and always have been, dead." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the hilarity of what you're talking about is that the game is an innocent concept gone wrong, and for some reason, everyone in the fandom has tried to put it back to normal. 

 So now we're at a place when everything seems so stupid because Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Freddy are so familiar to us in their happy cute cartoon forms.

Until you open up the game and play it again, which is when you realize that metal sculptures left in a pizzeria at night are moving towards you for mysterious reasons.

Scott said it best in the IGM interview: "Animatronics can be creepy when they move, sure. But its when they are turned off that the veil is lifted, and you realize that they were never alive. They are, and always have been, dead." </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-09 08:38:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Salvage obviously looks old and withered.  The 3rd game takes place 30 years later, so do you think that he could get that old and withered in 30 years time?

He obviously wasn't created after the pizzeria in FNAF1 shut down, and he wasn't pieced together from the remains of others since the Steam description says the animatronic was discovered, not built.  So he's been around.

What if he was in the first game.  What if he was the one creeping around, writing messages on the walls and on the backs of the signs...

WHAT IF SALVAGE HAS BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME

P.S. has it been confirmed if Shadow Bonnie from FNAF 2 is actually Salvage?  The teeth look similar.  If so, that would confirm his presence in both games. </TEXT>

In this article he talks about trying to keep it "relatively clean with no blood or guts" http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/developer-spotlight-scott-cawthon/

This reserved approach to horror is rarely seen but super effective, I mean the only comparison I could think of is Alfred Hitchcock (who was Catholic) who made thrillers like Psycho and the Birds </TEXT>
