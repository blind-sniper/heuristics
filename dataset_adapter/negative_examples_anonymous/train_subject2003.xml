<TEXT>  Here's a great answer by /u/holdoffhathcock:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3djsya/soldiers_of_reddit_what_is_something_you_wish_you/ct68lra?context=3

You have to memorize a truly, truly exhausting amount of information and be able to make calculations on the fly. You'll probably carry a calculator wherever you go as well as a little notebook full of tables. Some guys glue their notes to the stock of their rifle.

Look at the problem of putting a bullet on target at 300-400 meters, which is a little bit longer than a city block. At that distance, it's more or less point of aim point of impact, which means you don't have to do any adjusting, just point and shoot, pow. Past 500 meters, things start getting fun, and past 800 is basically magic. At that range, you're not pointing your rifle at the target. At that range, you're aiming at the air above it and somewhat off to the side. A bullet doesn't arc up and down like a basketball.

Gravity pulls down on the projectile as soon as it leaves the barrel. Air resistance pushes against the projectile, slowing it and sloughing it off to the side. The density of the air does the same thing, and makes the curve more lopsided and steep. How high above sea level you are has a huge effect on the path of the bullet, at higher altitudes, the projectile will travel farther and faster. Humidity has to be accounted for, for the same reason. Temperature, not only the ambient temperature but the temperature of the propellant in the ammunition you're loading. A bullet that has been warmed in the sun is going to hit about 20 inches higher at 1000 meters than a cold bullet. The rifling spins the projectile, at a 12 inch twist it will make a full rotation once for every 12 inches of travel. This means at 1000 meters it's going to spin about 3600 times, and the spin makes it drift to the side, sort of like a curveball if you like baseball comparisons. Are you aiming uphill or downhill? Aiming downhill you'd probably guess you need to aim a little lower, and you'd be right. But you also aim low while firing up-grade.

That's all math, that can be accounted for and adjusted for pretty simply with practice. It's wind. Wind is the motherfucker. A soft breeze will push you way off target when you're shooting out past 500 meters. But, when the projectile travels past 500 meters, the air it travels through isn't going to be the same that whole way down range. Think about the way a bird floats on swirls of hot air, and imagine trying to make a bullet travel a straight line through a whole series of those. Maybe where you're standing the wind is 3.5mph traveling north. Well, 300 meters out the wind is pushing in the opposite direction. 500 meters out it's blowing harder. 800 meters out there's dead air, and at 1200 meters there's a draft off the side of a tall building. There's no way to account for that, so you learn to scan your environment and make educated guesses. Watching the way dust and trash blows down the street, and watching the way laundry flutters while it dries on a balcony. Watching the direction grass and trees are bent in the breeze. You have to visualize this bizarre corkscrew of wind patterns that you want to shoot through.

You're still not done! Have you fired your rifle recently? Because a clean cold bore shot will come out slightly different than a warm shot, after the inside of the barrel gets coated with copper from the path of the bullet. You're constantly zeroing your weapon, finding out how it digests different loads of ammunition at different temperatures. And again, the temperature of the bullet is going to affect the path.

So we'll take a shot at 1250 meters. Pretend we're using an M24 with M118LR cartridges that came from a cool, dry place. You know your zero, you crank the bullet-drop compensator as high as it will go, to 1000 meters, calculate the ballistic correction for the extra 250 meters, which is probably going to be another good 9 feet, so you'll hold off using the dots on your reticle, which means you're aiming with the little dots below the crosshair instead of dead center. Slightly off to the side to compensate for the spin you know is happening, and what you guess is sort of going to happen when the wind throws it off balance. You're ready, you pull the trigger.

In the space between pulling the trigger and the propellant igniting, which is 22/1000th of a second, the average walking pace puts a person an inch away from where they were when you fired. If they're running, they move about two inches. For simplicity's sake, let's pretend your target isn't moving. 1250 meters is far enough for a bullet to float above the ground for several seconds, which means the earth rotates underneath the projectile and causes it to hit off-center even more than if it weren't beaten by wind, cutting through the air, fighting humidity, and everything else.

After all that, it's going to be an absolute miracle if you hit your target on the first shot. You're probably going to miss. Luckily, you have a spotter who can watch the path of the projectile and tell you exactly what adjustment to make before firing again. You're almost always going to fire two or three times at extreme distances before you actually hit what you're aiming at.
But "sometimes one shot, sometimes one kill" doesn't look as cool on a t-shirt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't really have to. With that much platinum available it would become feasible to develop fuel-cell batteries for electric vehicles. What I'd do is partner with a bunch of car companies in an equity-for-materials exchange (e.g. Tesla) where I became the supplier of the platinum and they give me stock instead of cash. Refuse to partner with anyone who doesn't give you favorable outcomes, while leaving enough on the table for friendlies to profit. With the cash you'd encourage R D into fuel-cell technology with the goal of putting a fuel-cell vehicle in 20% of American homes by Year 10. 

Keep in mind you already have the reputation of being the first company to harvest materials from a gigantic space asteroid, that's guaranteed to give you brand equity. Pump a few stories each year in the media on fuel-cell battery progress, get the first electric vehicles rolling off the assembly line in 5 years. Pretty sure all the stock in companies you exchanged your asteroid for will skyrocket. Continue development into heavy vehicles, promote a CO2 free future agenda, and continue expanding on your 20% monopoly. You'll probably be a trillion dollar company in 30 years. 

As far as how a government could profit, you'd do the same except that your target would be a net 1% increase in GDP instead of stock ownership in car companies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is in every conceivable way. With small businesses you're starting from the bottom up with an arbitrary goal, without any meaningful way to quantize what you set out to achieve. You're basically running on hope. With a big business, or at least an SME in a dominant local position, you can say with reasonable certainty that we'll make X dollars on Y date. With a small business you're at the mercy of the business gods, e.g. big retailer moving in and draining demand, economic crisis sapping the pockets of your would-be customers, fire started two blocks down blocking the street, bad publicity from unrelated event halfway around the world, Paypal blocking your account for 90 days, etc. Ever heard stories of Greek mortals trying to defeat the gods of Mount Olympus? It's not an inaccurate representation. With business, it's more about luck and persistence than it is about actual finance.

You hear a lot about the heroes who survived; you never hear about those who died in vain. Dead men tell no tales. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a longtime Apple shareholder. Apple's only major asset right now is the iPhone and associated assets like brand. iPad/Mac doesn't really have room to grow. Apple Pay isn't going to kill anyone anytime soon, and its contribution to bottom line for the medium term is negligible. Apple Watch isn't going to be the next paradigm. I say this with the authority of someone with a decade of tech experience.

At this point you can kinda expect growth to be powered exclusively by the iPhone and buy backs. I'm giving it about 9% EPS growth going forward. Unless there's a new development I'd say the 17x P/E is a pretty accurate valuation. 

Google on the other hand is killing it, with sustainable 15-20% EPS growth going forward. They're pretty much like Visa or MasterCard in the FCF department. They also rely on only one thing to power earnings, but Search is such a huge moat I don't worry about it. The only problem is the high P/E of 28. That puts it pretty much on par with AAPL as an investment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's fine, I find that passionate people make better investors than professionals. Yeah I'm doing that now, just want to get some feedback from others who have done the same. At this point profits seem to mainly depend on: i) volume/activity, and ii) tracking the stock market in general. So when it's up it's up, and when it's down it's down. It can't be as simple as that, so I wanted to ask if there is anything I might be missing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's actually a good reason for this. The medical logistics system is extremely fractured and messed up. It may seem like there's one cohesive system with programs like Medicaid in place, but it's more of an umbrella of a thousand little fiefdoms (hospitals) than a single kingdom (government). Each of these hospitals closely guard their costs so that they can remain competitive, while suppliers individually negotiate with each hospital to secure the best prices. It's a cutthroat world in medicine; if your prices were known publicly while others kept theirs secret, you would quickly go out of business as suppliers and customers picked and chose. 

As a result, literally nobody, not even the government, can pinpoint the actual average market price for a particular strain of medicine. That's why you get very different prices for the same medicine between different states; you can even see huge spreads between hospitals in the same state. Add to this the fact that medical aid isn't exactly a price elastic market - if I break an arm, I'm not going to go to a hospital in the next city just because it's cheaper there. 

Since the insurance companies don't know the average prices, they have to model their risks based on the price quoted by the highest hospital. As a result, insurance becomes very expensive; so the hospitals adapt to the insurance environment by billing the maximum amount possible. Billing the actual costs isn't feasible if they are to recoup what they pay for insurance; and it isn't feasible for insurance companies to provide coverage at the level mandated by governments by modelling risks on median costs. This creates a vicious cycle where hospital bills and insurance prices become grossly inflated, but nobody wins. Add to this the fact that provision of medical aid is mandatorily and vigorously encouraged by the government, and you have very little incentive for the market to withdraw to a lower price level. 

tl;dr: it's not a problem with any particular individual; it's just the way the system is. The only way to correct prices is to publicly publish prices in all hospitals; good luck with that.  </TEXT>

The same way a thousand years ago nobody could have understood what gravity was, today there's still some lack in our fundamentals of science which cannot explain everything. Which is why we're drawing all these crazy conclusions; because the extrapolations rely on the wrong assumptions. We actually really don't know anything yet. </TEXT>

It's like a newspaper headline for the parts of Reddit that 80% of users don't know about; more about raising awareness to a larger subset of users than "oooh shiny!". Judging by the response the other day to anything mildly resembling /u/chooter (did you see the documentary about Queen Victoria? that was great), I'd say it definitely deserves a place here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's important to realize that these "people" are just the same as us. They're not any different from us; they have the same fears, worries, etc. The distinction lies in the societal framework which differentiates the "haves" with the "have nots". Their destructive acts are just means to align themselves with society's rules, not sincere malice. Society's rules for them dictate that they "should" be offensive, where in actual fact they're really just hiding who they really are inside. Hence two people who are alike in almost every way can be divided into two camps which society determines. The enemy isn't "those people", it's the framework of society itself. When you find friends who don't rely on this framework as their identity and can stand on their own, you'll find that there's very little difference between the introverts and extroverts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it helps, I used to be the awkward quiet skinny guy in school as well. Now I get girls checking me out in public, even though I look exactly the same. You need to learn who you really are and find your own confidence in your identity, that's what will help you turn the ship around. 

Let me let you in on a little secret. All those popular handsome people who are treating you like shit? They're doing that because they're just as insecure as you are. I only realized that after I spent years improving myself to be just as good as them, only to reconnect with them and realize I had surpassed them by such a wide margin, because they were never better than me on the first place. Seriously, none of them are any better than you. I'm not saying this as motivation, it's fact.  

PM me if you wanna talk.

<TEXT> As a devout Christian, I think people need to realize something. The people who can't handle hard questioning, or end up getting frustrated, are really doing it for themselves. I'm not saying their intentions are insincere, just that they identify with it as an extension of their person, rather than actually enjoying God. 

It's the same in any other setting, e.g. science - the ones who make the most noise do so because they are trying to reinforce something which "belongs" to them, be it a belief, a position or status, etc; not because they actually understand that the calculations for the origins of the big bang rely on two primary axioms (that the speed of light is constant in all frames of reference and that there is nothing faster than the speed of light). Whereas the real scientists or missionaries just keep quiet and are okay with acknowledging things they sincerely don't fully understand. They maintain their position, but they keep quiet. 

The loud ones are the ones who can't handle the current circumstances and desperately seek to affect a change to "restore" the environment to how they feel it should be, because they see the circumstances as an extension of themselves. If you truly were seeking the truth (be it in science or God) and not care for the self, you wouldn't bother with the social cost that comes with making enemies for little tangible benefit. It's not like you're actually going to effect any real change, i.e. change someone's mind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks for the insight. however, I don't think that's correct, as KO famously had an extremely high P/E when Buffett first looked at it. This article says it was a P/E of around 25-30: https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-P-E-Buffett-paid-for-Coca-Cola. So I don't know where he got the 59/100 figure from, which implies a P/E of less than 2. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Can someone shed some light on this quote I found here? 
http://studentofvalue.com/deliberate-practice-2-coca-cola-1988/

In 1989 there was strong evidence (in the 10-k) of increasing returns on investment AND growth AND the share price was at the equivalent of $10. **The annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents**, far above its ROIC of 22%. Those circumstances represent obvious value. Obvious to anyone who cared to look and cared to think even a little about it.

In 2012, theres 9% return on every dollar of new investment, far below the ROIC of 72.8%. It can grow all it likes at 9% returns and it wont create a dime of value Besides, the shares are now not at $10 but at $79 .

What does "annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents" mean? It's not P/E, nor is it ROA, as calculated in this other article: http://www.gurufocus.com/news/205476/revisiting-buffett--cocacola-in-1988

*I suppose he's referring to earnings per dollar of retained earnings, but even that's not right*. Anybody can shed some light on what the 59 cents he's referring to is? 

I couldn't find the 1989 KO financial statements, but I did find the 1988 ones which shouldn't have differed by much: https://www.scribd.com/doc/34149986/KO-1988 </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I found this comment by commentor 'red' particularly insightful:

Because some revenue growth adds no value, some revenue growth even destroys value. Look it up, if you like.

The idea the revenue growth and high margins together drive value is wrong.
What drives value creation is growth without a deterioration in the return on investment.

In 1989 there was strong evidence (in the 10-k) of increasing returns on investment AND growth AND the share price was at the equivalent of $10. The annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents, far above its ROIC of 22%. Those circumstances represent obvious value. Obvious to anyone who cared to look and cared to think even a little about it.

In 2012, theres 9% return on every dollar of new investment, far below the ROIC of 72.8%. It can grow all it likes at 9% returns and it wont create a dime of value Besides, the shares are now not at $10 but at $79 . </TEXT>

<TEXT>  *This is the relevant portion of the article, which was originally written by the user 'coc' in CBF: http://www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca/forum/fairfax-financial/what-percentage-of-your-portfolio-is-in-fairfax-financial/30/*

Im surprised you all let this go. Id like to comment on two things, both of which I consider nonsense.

1. It is very easy to find securities that will outperform the market.

2. Holding Fairfax is inferior to running around finding these very easy securities.

I think investors vastly underestimate how good Warren Buffett was at his job back in the 1950s and 1960s when he was buying these niche securities. Hes even better now, but obviously runs so much capital that his returns are lower. There seems to be this Buffett envy going on in value investing circles whereby investors feel the need to look for little cigar butts similar to what Warren used to  largely influenced by his talks to students and his biography.

And yet, I have seen precious few investors who have successfully done it. Beyond the platitude that smaller areas of the market are inefficient, there are considerable risks. You are usually investing in second rate businesses that destroy value, or at least are not really building any. Often these businesses are run by inexperienced managers and have little advantage over their competitors. Thus, the business risks you assume are big ones, although most investors think a cheap valuation makes up for it. Sometimes, but not always.

Take for an example Dempster Mill Mftg  a well known Buffett investment way back when. If you think through the situation, there was a good probability that the investment was not a wise one. It took heroic efforts by a new manager to keep Dempster from going under, and even then, it was not an absolute home run. Yet, most Buffetteers admire these types of investments Warren used to make.

But what was Warrens largest partnership investment? American Express, a well known company then and now, not a micro-cap dishwasher manufacturer. He also had a successful investment in Disney, and one in GEICO, again two companies that were well known. What was probably his best stock investment at Berkshire? The Washington Post, not exactly unknown.

Yet were told that he made all of his great returns back then because he could look small. Well, as with everything in life, the answer is yes and no. I think there is a great myth that you need to look where no-one else is looking and be creative in the investment process. That you should get points for creativity or something. But the very same people propagating this myth are students of Charlie Munger, who once wrote to Wesco shareholders that We try to profit more from always remembering the obvious then grasping the esoteric.

Lets talk about a few more of Warrens home runs. Petrochina, one of the largest companies on the planet. Freddie Mac, one of the largest companies on the planet. Coca-Cola, the most well-known brand on the planet. BYD, one of Chinas most well-known and well-respected companies. These are investments where, for the first 5-10 years, he made 25%+ compound annual returns. Who are these people not getting rich by consistently generating 25% compound returns? Where is this stock market where 25% annual returns dont generate alpha? Why do small investors need to run around looking at micro-caps?

***

Lets also look at some other legendary investors. What sort of returns did they achieve and what were they buying? Lou Simpson  20%+ type returns buying very well known companies. Rick Guerin  25% type returns investing in a pretty broad range of securities small and large. Ruane, Cunniff  15% over 40 years investing in large stocks. Eddie Lampert at ESL  you would probably know of almost every company he ever invested in  30% CAGR for a 15-20 year period. Glenn Greenberg at Chieftain  did 25% for about 20 years, again youd probably recognize almost every stock he owned.

These guys are legends, theyre all rich, and they invested in a huge range of securities.

Who do we know of that was investing in small securities that no one has heard of? Heres two: Schloss and Graham. Did either of them do 50% compounded? Hell no. Theyre hall-of-famers with 15-20% returns. Do I need to bring up Charlies returns? What has he bought over time?

So I dispute this notion that investors are somehow doing themselves a disservice by sticking with companies they know well and that others know well. Well-known companies are often just as mispriced as small ones. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, says Munger. Yet the Buffetteers seem to only admire one tool for finding cheap stocks (size constraints), when myopia, ignorance, and a host of other biases are just as powerful in creating misvalued securities.

To wrap this up a little, Im not saying there arent lots of small mispriced stocks. Buffett did very well with them, and there are probably others doing great, too. But recognize two things: 1. Huge CAGRs are really, really hard. 2. You can do extremely well investing in larger companies, great companies, and well-known companies, without a lot of the risks of investing in broken-down nags. This is well proven.

So if you rationally evaluate Fairfax and come to the conclusion that youre going to get 15-20%+ CAGR (eminently reasonable given the fact that they are a relatively small player in a gigantic global insurance market and are run by one of the smarter investment teams on the planet), dont worry about how much alpha youre not generating by looking elsewhere. Was it a mistake to invest in Berkshire when it had a billion dollar market cap and was well known? I repeat, there are no points for creativity. Dont forget it takes a unique cast of mind to just sit on some great companies and compound at high rates with no taxes, professional investor or not.

Im probably not going to convert anyone who believes strongly that they have to be looking in the dirty alleys for cheap stocks, but if youre on the fence, hopefully this is food for thought. </TEXT>

As long as the latter is high enough, it doesn't matter that the former is poor (to a certain extent).

<TEXT> Basically you have no chance compared to someone who actually has a finance degree. You want to have something on your resume which will actually get your foot in the door in the bigger banks or boutiques. 

The best way to do that would be to have some experience as an analyst. Most junior level credit analyst jobs involves stuff you've already learned getting your CPA, so you're definitely capable. You just want to get some credibility so that the banks will actually look at you. 

So go to a small shop who usually can't afford the 100k IB salary, offer to work for half of that, then add it to your resume six months later and apply at a bank. Most of these jobs usually have very long probation periods (6 months) built in because they expect you to jump ship before then. Once you have a 6 month stint on your resume, the banks will actually give you a glance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got a position in the Restructuring at KPMG once.

Basically, the investment banks do all the calculations, then they hire KPMG to do all the heavy lifting (e.g. effecting all the operational changes, informing an army of foreign labor they've just been let go, dealing with bribery, etc.). So yes, it was technically 'Restructuring', but you don't actually do any of the math stuff. It's basically like what an audit junior is to 'Audit'.

Not sure whether it's the same in your case, but I don't think they'd be able to pay peanuts if it was the same type of work at the IB's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but the character's base stats heavily favored one role so most people didn't bother switching. You'll find very few STR Rinoa's or DEF Lulu's. Whereas experimentation of jobs was a key trait in earlier games; the fact that Lvl 99 Onion Knights were an achievement shows that jobs were meant to be a deep part of the game's foundations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's either revolutionary or rebellious. It changed a lot of the traditional aspects that fanboys had grown up with (e.g. no victory theme for regular battles) and felt entitled to. And the character development of the main character was basically non-existent. However it had an extremely rich plot, extremely well fleshed out battle system and the game world was almost MMORPG sized. You can literally spend over 1000 hours in it and not finish every side quest. 

The other gripe by fanboys was that it went back to the original FF styles before the gripe-y nature of FF7, so those who learned about Final Fantasy after 7 naturally felt it wasn't very "Final Fantasy". Up to today, the FF camp can be split evenly between the old boys and the new boys - with the old boys preferring mana casting, job switching, fairy tale escapism; while the new boys prefer fixed roles per character, over-the-top flashiness and gritty realism. 

If you've never played a FF game before though, you'll be sure to like it as you'll be coming in without any biases.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's only mind blowing in the context of today. Look at a multiple decade stock market chart and you'll realize that astronomical drops of 50% look like blips overall. You have to realize that context is relative, so looking back at technological progress from the next century would blow your mind by twice as much. 

The correct way to reconcile your mind blowing-ness is that nature develops at a logarithmic rate not an arithmetic rate, and hence progress has to be charted as a relative construct as opposed to an absolute one. It only makes sense to account for progress as that made between two points of development as opposed to comparing all random points in time on the same scale to the beginning. When you do it that way, it doesn't seem that extraordinary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wealth is relative. When you've only experienced growing up rich, it seems normal. Have you ever held yourself accountable for being richer than 80% of the world's population? For instance, by not complaining? Many would (and probably have) kill to be where we are. 

The correct way to find peace with money isn't to get more of it, but to stop seeing those with less as inferior. For instance, Myanmar Rohingyas are every bit as equal as we are, just much unluckier.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What did you say to me you little bitch? I'll have you know I survived through two financial meltdowns, and graduated top of my MBA class in Harvard Business School. I have been trained in value investing, day trading, currency hedging and advanced options strategies and I'm the top investor on the entire Street. You are nothing to me but just another whiny wantrepreneur trying to make your first million. I will take an opposing position to your trade and wipe you out by spoofing the market and causing a flash crash. You think you can get away with this kind of amateur analysis on the Internet? Think again, you penny stock pumper. As we speak I am contacting the Federal Reserve and informing them that you are a good-for-nothing, society draining top-down economics bear, and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, penny pincher. The storm which wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your portfolio. Not only am I extensively trained in the ways of Graham and Doddsville, but I have access to the phonelines of Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, Bill Gross, Ben Bernanke and Jim Cramer *combined*; and I will use my political and social capital to its fullest extent to wipe your miserable trades off the face of the market. I will call the offices of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Lehman Brothers to ensure you will never spend another day slaving over adjusting font sizes in Powerpoint slides at 3AM in the morning. If only you could have known what your tongue wagging would have wagered on you; but you couldn't, you wouldn't, and now you're paying the price. I will short ALL the trades that you go long in and flood all the stocks you go short in, and you will drown in RED. You're dead, kiddo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your par interest would still be 21.5% in 1988. It's impossible to think of it now, but at the time rampant inflation was considered a very real threat. The yield reflected accurate sentiments on the dollar's purchasing power at the time.

Go do a google search of Vockler during his tenure. It was a very interesting and very different time, almost alien. Even Warren Buffett expected inflation to continue breaking new highs indefinitely. There was even someone here who bought 30y Treasuries at 15% awhile ago, which if he had held would have made him look like a genius.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit's upper echelons are starting to clear out the weeds to transform it into a family friendly "real" company. They're going to turn it into a mix of Huffington Post (content supplied free by users) and Buzzfeed (content aggregation), launch a platform of real money earning initiatives (redditmarket.com) and slowly build it up until they can take it public and cash out. Expect more "unoffensive" advertisements, product placement in privileged real estate, and significant benefits for gold users over the next few years.

Tell me I'm crazy, but this site is a goldmine for anyone who can figure it out.

<TEXT> That's alright, I appreciate what you've done for me so far. It would be really great if you could keep me posted if any extra work falls your way. I'm more interested in building my client portfolio than the money at this point.

Would you mind sharing emails? If you'd like any professional advice regarding financial or investing matters (or even random questions), I'd love to be able to help as well. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, really appreciate the feedback. 

I admit the grammatical error is my fault, but regarding the tone most of that was due to multiple revisions requested by the client. The article started off with the more natural tone as in /r/investing, but when the client wanted me to fix sentences here and there according to their liking without explaining why, the article as a whole ended up sounding disjointed. Also, sometimes you're not quite sure what the client actually wants, so when he says 'ok' I just rolled with it and wrapped it up.

I'm positive I could deliver on decent industry standards if required, and I have the background expertise to fulfill it. Could I perhaps write a new article on any recent relevant topic and resubmit them to you? Or get the client to edit the old one? 

Thanks in advance regardless. Appreciate the time and effort spent.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's some unsolicited advice from a 100k user. Nobody really cares. It may feel serious when you're inside the box, but really from the outside it's insignificant. Try and recall when some other Redditor was the target of a controversy... did you remember it one week later? Or why some offenders make things worse trying to justify themselves, when the best course of action was to simply ignore the outcry? Just let the guy have his day. Nobody will remember it by tomorrow. </TEXT>

I also happen to work as a financial analyst, so I may be of some use in that direction. I could do a full-blown financial analysis on a stock if necessary. Here's an example of what I do everyday: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/355r0a/i_found_a_2001_article_on_amazon_describing_the/cr1enb7

Drawing a contrast to the present economic system, how would you go about creating a social balancing system from scratch which would have a chance of being practically efficient over 200 years? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see where you're going with this. You're saying that the current economic system is still far from fully mature. Hence any attempt to emulate it with a reputation system would be beset by the same imperfections. Hmmm, good points.

Here's where I'm coming from. I'm an investor/analyst working for a billion dollar fund. Basically, I've noticed that broadly speaking, optimal capital allocation is a balance between allocating resources for maximum financial gain and achieving the best social outcome for all stakeholders. I'm not sure what the equivalent is in economics, but that's what it is in investing. However, while it is intuitive to strive for the maximum financial gain on the resource end, typically striving for the maximum social gain is counterproductive to finance. So my conclusion is that there is a lack of accountability for the social side of things in the present economic system (i.e. currency) which fails to take into account the social balance of things, which is why a positive social action is reflected as a negative in a financial context - where optimal capital allocation is represented by something in the middle. If we could create some kind of system of accountability which comprehensively describes both sides of the equation, we might be able to increase productivity by leaps and bounds, as it might reflect in full what financial accountability (i.e. economics) only represents half of. Think of it as what general relativity was to gravity - the former being a more complete representation of reality than the latter to describe reality. You could even win a Nobel prize for it, as this would have immediate and discernible impact on every large company on the planet. 

What are your thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> you make very good points. We can already see how karma, even without financial incentives, have bred karmawhores who upend the system with reposts. I get what you're saying that the difficult part is tracking down the perverse incentives. Hmm. But perhaps the reputation market will right itself to a significant extent, as the financial market has to at least offer a utilitarian system.

<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think you have where I am coming from. I'm suggesting a complete change in perspective. You mentioned this:

 How would social value not be arbitrary? You're talking about picking a way that things "should" be and providing an incentive to bring reality more in line with that ideal situation, no? Well, the problem is that people don't agree on that ideal. They're never going to precisely agree.

Well, putting aside the 'how', my suggestion is *to* find a way to make social value not arbitrary. Yes I know it sounds impossible; I'm just putting forth an axiom. *If* we were able to do that, then we could make social goodwill accountable and hence tradable as a form of currency, right? And there would be innumerable good resulting from having such a system. So how do we do that - make social value accountable? 

Again, I realize how impossible it sounds, but my point is to find a way to make social value as accountable as financial value. I was wondering whether someone of your stature might have any ideas, or would be interested in such a discussion. </TEXT>

A more feasible plan would be to build a mercenary army with potatoes as trade. Potatoes are the cheapest form of calories, so controlling the supply would guarantee you a stream of loyal soldiers in poverty territories. Trade potatoes for favors and arms with the most corrupt people on this planet. You could then trade those as currency.

<TEXT> Yes, but if we were able to institute a system which provides proper accountability to social value, then it wouldn't be arbitrary. The problem now is that such accountability doesn't yet exist, hence we turn to financial measures to record them, which obviously doesn't provide adequate incentive. If we could work out an economic system which rewarded social value as much as currency  rewards trade value, I'm sure we coild start working something out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking more along the lines of creating accountability for social value. Some way or currency we could use to recognize goodwill so that we could store it and reward it a realistic manner. Like you said, recognizing social standing as a currency would incentivize socially positive acts by individuals in society. It would make charitable acts feasibly economical on a large scale where financially it may not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> word of mouth. Sometimes I luck out on someone searching on a public forum and then show them my portfolio, but most of the time it's just recommendations. So the ones who are comfortable paying $50 tend to recommend others who are comfortable paying $50. 

Would it be too much to ask to share some contacts? I'd love to return the favor in any way I can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey, I've been doing $50/500 words for awhile now and I'm looking to the next level. At the moment I've mostly been getting clients through word of mouth, but I've been having difficulty scaling the rates as they mostly recommend other clients who are only comfortable up to $50. Any tips? I'd be fine with $100. </TEXT>

Now, this is 1 million birds, expressed in the same unit:

100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000

<TEXT> Lack of incentive. Communism requires adequate systems to ensure fair distribution of resources. Current level of society in the US still dictates that the needs of the many outweigh those of the individual. Once you get an adequate equilibrium going between the individual and community, like in some European countries, it actually works pretty well. e.g. high taxes but great health-care. In those countries, the incentive for personal gain by harming others is far more limited while risk remains the same. But where the return far outweighs the risk, like here, then there is far more incentive to be selfish. </TEXT>

Essentially, I wouldn't mind hiding stuff behind stuff/faking opulence if it manages to achieve the look. I came across this book in my research, is it any good? http://www.amazon.com/Decorating-Rich-Achieve-Without-Spending/dp/0394566300 </TEXT>

<TEXT> *"It doesn't involve luck, you just have to try hard."*

No buddy, luck is all it involves. You're a minuscule speck in the universe of commerce and capitalism around you, a simple vibration of an atom would render you bankrupt. That's not for lack of trying either; if a bad thing happens, it doesn't really matter what you do, you're going down. Just be thankful that money is all you can lose in this country. 

On the flip side, it's also why you get to become gloriously rich if you succeed. Because you're leveraging on the failures of everyone else who didn't. GDP doesn't grow fast enough for everyone to succeed on their own merits. And if you think you're controlling the failures of everyone else in your hand, you need to double check your privilege. Even the President can't figure out the economy. The fact is that almost nothing is under your control. Be honest with yourself and you'll recognize that.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't try. You still have to put yourself out into the surf to catch the wave. But whether that wave decides to pick you up or slam you down is not under your discretion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amazon acts as cost leader. It can't raise its prices anymore than Walmart can. You have to consider how different products have to have their margins raised unevenly to accommodate volume differences, with the most pronounceable raises being observed in the high margin category. And when all its competitors also stand on tiptoes by raising revenues by 1%, it doesn't improve their relative strategic standing. In any case, pretty sure they already raise their overall prices by single digit percentages every year. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-12 06:00:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts, which are an expensive
distraction for many investors and businessmen. **Thirty years ago, no one could have
foreseen the huge expansion of the Vietnam War**, wage and price controls, two oil
shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a one-day drop
in the Dow of 508 points, or treasury bill yields fluctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%.

**But, surprise - none of these blockbuster events made the slightest dent in Ben
Graham's investment principles. Nor did they render unsound the negotiated
purchases of fine businesses at sensible prices.** Imagine the cost to us, then, if we had
let a fear of unknowns cause us to defer or alter the deployment of capital. Indeed, we
have usually made our best purchases when apprehensions about some macro event were
at a peak. Fear is the foe of the faddist, but the friend of the fundamentalist.   ^([emphasis added]) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since the purpose of the CFS is to act as a check on the income statement, just look for anything which might indicate manipulation via timing of cash flows. e.g. unusual investments, refinancing patterns, funding dividends from loans, etc. It's also useful to pick out any abnormally large adjustments. Stuff which skip the income statement and go straight to the balance sheet are also red flags, like unsustainable principal repayments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to explain this from the perspective of the income statement, but it should help you understand the cash flow statement as well. 

When a company earns cash, it goes into its wallet. Now if this were a 'project' instead of a 'company', the cash earned would immediately exit the sphere of the 'project' and go straight to the 'owners'. Thus the cash earned attributed to the project is obvious. 

However, a company might choose to retain the cash and reinvest it into a second project instead of giving it back. Now this is a large investment which drains your cash. When investors look at this, it has the wrong effect of attributing your empty cash balance to dismal performance of the first project - when in fact it did very well.  So to record actual performance, you match the expense against the revenues of the appropriate timeframe, i.e. future revenues and not past revenues. This is the concept of the income statement. 

However, companies are not static entities; they're constantly in a state of flux. The moment more cash comes in, they reinvest it. Thus it becomes exceedingly important to maintain a record of past performance (i.e. past cash flows earned attributed to past operations), so that past performance is correctly attributed to past operations. This is the net profit amount, and is accumulated in the retained earnings figure. 

This also has the great advantage of allowing more complex cash movements like loans, receivables etc. Basically, divorcing the actual cash flows from performance allowed companies to delay or speed up their expenses, which facilitated the liquidity of money itself. We would later recognize this as "float". 

That's why in the beginning, the SEC only required income statements and not cash flow statements; because given enough time, the cash flow statement eventually catches up to the income statement. The cash flow statement was therefore effectively redundant for making long term decisions. 

The problem arose when companies started to take advantage of this divorce from cash flows to manipulate earnings. For instance, constantly refinancing at higher and higher rates until the Ponzi scheme collapsed. Basically, the authorities realized that only allowing investors to observe the tip of the pyramid - and not the base on which it rests - allowed management to hide stuff for a long time before reality caught up. This was why the SEC reintroduced the cash flow statement - to provide a check and balance against the income statement which was built on top of it. 

Remember, the income statement merely matches cash flows across time; so in perpetuity both eventually converge. Thus, even though the cash flow statement was redundant for long term purposes, it made apparent the steps which were taken to arrive at the income statement. So that when the time comes to realize the retained earnings amount, the cash will be there.

<TEXT> Of more practical importance is the question whether or not investment
can be successfully carried on in common stocks that appear cheap
from the quantitative angle and thatupon studyseem to have average
prospects for the future. Securities of this type can be found in reasonable
abundance, as a result of the stock markets obsession with companies considered
to have unusually good prospects of growth. Because of this emphasis
on the growth factor, quite a number of enterprises that are long
established, well financed, important in their industries and presumably
destined to stay in business and make profits indefinitely in the future, but
that have no speculative or growth appeal, tend to be discriminated against
by the stock marketespecially in years of subnormal profitsand to ***sell
for considerably less than the business would be worth to a private owner***.


Note that we have applied the touchstone of value to a private investor to justify two different
types of *investment* in common stocks: 

(1) purchase of issues thought to have exceptional
prospects at no higher price than would be paid for a corresponding interest in a private business,
and 

(2) purchase of issues with good records and average prospects at a much lower price
than the business is worth to a private owner. 

See Appendix Note 45, p. 778 on accompanying
CD, for the exhibit of an issue of the latter type (Swift and Company).

<TEXT> The new-era investment theory was conspicuously reticent on the mathematical side. The
relationship between price and earnings, or price and trend of earnings was anything that
the market pleased to make it (note the price of Electric Power and Light compared with its
earnings record given on p. 363). If an attempt were to be made to give a mathematical
expression to the underlying idea of valuation, ***it might be said that it was based on the***
**derivative** ***of the earnings, stated in terms of time***. In recent years more serious efforts have
been made to establish a mathematical basis for discounting expected future earnings or dividends.
See Gabriel Preinreich, The Theory of Dividends, New York, 1935; and J. B. Williams,
The Theory of Investment Value, Cambridge, Mass., 1938. The latter work is built on the
premise that the value of a common stock is equal to the present value of all future dividends.
This principle gives rise to an elaborate series of mathematical equations designed to
calculate exactly what a common stock is worth, assuming certain vital facts about future
earnings, distribution policy and interest rates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is all good and fair, and if they are applying conservative accounting policies by immediately expensing R D then I commend their professionalism. But if that's true then the bigger problem is why are they expensing so much of it? R D can only be capitalized when there is a reasonable expectation that it will eventually yield profits - so if they are expensing nonessentials at this order of magnitude, you really have to wonder whether they are allocating capital wisely. 

In fact, if I were to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept this as truth, it might be even worse - since it signals that they are desperately trying to come up with something new, which could mean they *know* that their current position is unsustainable. Which is simply dumping water out of a leaking boat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually I took a cursory look at their 2013 financial statements. It seems that the reason for their losses are twofold: firstly gross margins are very low, which is fine; but they also have very high administrative expenses which eat up everything left. I dug into it and found that two aspects were the leading causes: Sales   Fulfillment. Sales is the commissions etc. to bring revenues, while Fulfillment refers to affiliates-related activity. There is no further drill-down analysis.

Now, the main argument for Amazon actually being wildly profitable if they stopped reinvesting is that the cash flows are being "sunk" into CAPEX, right? Since the bulk of SG A are Sales and Fulfillment, the increase in net profit if they stop reinvesting will have to come from either of these. I did a little more research into what Sales and Fulfillment means. Sales apparently is quite straightforward - commissions etc, so there's little room for interpretation there. But Fulfillment is a little trickier - they mostly relate to warehouse activity. As the cost of building new warehouses and scaling their SaaS segment makes up most of their reinvestments, these "sunk" cash flows are being attributed to Fulfillment expenses. 

But remember that CAPEX does not flow through the income statement - it goes straight to the balance sheet and is reflected as depreciation/amortization, and is insignificant compared to both Sales and Fulfillment. So Fulfillment expenses on the income statement doesn't actually relate to reinvesting activity, but rather the ancillary costs of building new warehouses, e.g. hiring more people, or paying for rights to inventory. Or they could just as well be amortization of Goodwill from their robust acquisition spree, like the impressive Kiva robots. In any case, this means that Fulfillment expenses do not actually go down when reinvestment stops - they simply stop scaling up. Thus, the net profit figure that you see now is the actual future free cash flow if they simply stopped investing today. 

The point I'm trying to make is that I do not see how the argument that they would be profitable if they stopped reinvesting makes sense. The income statement matches cash flows across time, so it reflects how future cash flows will look like assuming Amazon remains as a going concern. Which means that cash flows will eventually catch up with profits; which means future cash flows = net profit. Which is bad news for Amazon. Cash flows may appear strong today, but that is just "float" which has to eventually be absorbed by future outflows. 

edit - Tl;dr: Amazon is not sinking money into future growth. It is sinking money into upkeep of past growth activity, which is correctly reflected as expenses. Therefore the net profit figure IS the correct amount of free cash flow. Unless I'm missing something else, the net profit/retained earnings figure is all the future cash shareholders will enjoy from present day business. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  One of the great mysteries of today's market is the way Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock trades at such a huge discount to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. In terms of price-to-earnings, Apple trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 12, while Amazon trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 193. This happens despite Apple growing revenues faster than Amazon, growing earnings, and growing estimates. Amazon not only has revenues that grow slower, but its earnings have been falling for two years straight. Amazon's earnings are also predicted to fall in 2012 vs. 2011, and its next-quarter earnings are predicted to fall 95% from the year before. Finally, Amazon's EPS estimates for the next quarter were slashed 90% just days ago.

 Knowing this, it's hard to understand how Amazon can not only trade at a premium to Apple, but indeed trade at an earnings valuation multiple that is a full 16 times larger than Apple's. To put things into perspective, if Apple traded at Amazon's earnings multiple, it would trade at $9,000. Or if Amazon traded at Apple's multiple, it would trade for just $14.16.

So is there any explanation for this absurd disconnect? Yes, there might be one. </TEXT>

It's one of the most efficient ways to permanently harness power from a solar entity, and would permit a civilization to gradually scale its economic investment with its power needs. For instance, a younger spacefaring civilization would probably only require a Dyson ring, whereas a mature one would probably have a complete sphere which almost completely envelops the star, save for sustainability requirements. It also has the advantage of drawing power from the star without actually interfering with it and possibly invoking supernova, such as with a fusion solution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is actually one existing concept of the multiverse. To summarize, Einstein discovered that there is actually no such thing as "distance" or "time" as independent concepts, it's actually one cohesive unit of measure known as "space-time". It's only when viewed from insignificant dimensions like ours that space and time have distinct characteristics. This space-time is considered to be the subsequent 4th dimension to our existing 3 dimensions of point, length and height/width. 

The gravity characteristics of black holes exhibit the limits of space-time, which is why it is often portrayed in science fiction as portals into another dimension. It is posited that beyond such limits lie the entrance to a higher dimension, which some theorize as the multiverse, whether through black holes or not. 

Like you said, an entity existing in a lower dimension will be unable to observe an entity existing in a higher dimension, e.g. if you existed in the 2nd dimension you would only be able to see in a line (i.e. left and right), but not up or down (i.e. in the 3rd dimension); hence if I were above you you would not know I was there even if I were right next to you. Similarly, an entity with access to the 4th dimension could exist and interact with us in the 3rd dimension without our awareness. So an entity bearing the characteristics of "God" as defined by popular culture could very possibly be a being in a higher dimension, and it would still be internally consistent with our present theories of science. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as any individual human being tries, he can only do so much. He may be an ant where others are mere atoms, but he is still an ant. Beyond that insignificant capacity, it's completely up to chance. 

If you take the time to study history, you will find that all great successes in history were at least 60% up to luck and chance. The disparity is explained by survivorship bias, where you only see the winners but not the losers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. It's not plus, it's multiply. The 2nd CoC is just an assumption that cost of capital will grow at a constant rate over time. 

2. Yes, it's because of that. The idea is that earnings growth can be expressed as an average of a large one-time number, whereas ROIC can't be window-dressed. Hence, his example of a poor acquisition demonstrates that growth numbers alone are illusory and can hide deeper symptoms which ROIC picks out. 

It's a pretty good article, and is one of the best attempts I've seen to provide a theoretical explanation for P/E. However, it still doesn't provide a perfect practical solution to the real world. As far as I've gathered, P/E doesn't seem to be grounded in any fundamental principle, it's just a reflection of sentiment to the share. </TEXT>

When one of their species accidentally dropped a lab culture on the barren asteroid Seerowpedia during one of their holidays, the resultant exposure spawned the first ancestors of what we now recognize as the Yeerks.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You may not know this, but you cannot buy insurance for your pitchforks! Consider these scenarios:

* How many times have you waved your pitchforks in the air only to hit it against a signboard and have it break at the most critical time of the protest? 

* Mistaken for carrying lethal arms by law enforcement when holding a pitchfork?

* Shelled out-of-pocket for third party liability? 

Avoid all these problems and more with Plungers Protest! Shop smart today!!! </TEXT>

Kanye*: "Those things are not single-piece; they're delivered in broken-up pieces to be assembled! This is not what was shown on the website! I cannot believe I got hoodwinked into trading my plunger for a pitchfork. Never again!"

<TEXT> If you don't feel happy, can you express how you do feel? Do you feel satisfied, or do you think happiness is a myth? I've always heard really wealthy people say they just feel like normal people. Some even choose suicide due to their overwhelming responsibilities, despite occupying what many would consider a privileged position. What are your views on this?

<DATE> 2015-04-01 07:47:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To clarify, I'm not referring to the exclusion of the Apocrypha resulting from the Catholic-Protestant split following the Reformation of Martin Luther. I'm referring instead to the consensus arrived at during the Councils of Carthage, Nicea and Trent, between 300-400 AD. 

Are there any reliable sources detailing the discussion and rationale that was held in arriving at the canonical books? Such as why the book of Enoch was not included, and why the books of Paul make up the majority of the New Testament? I'd be really interested in reading an actual surviving transcript of the dialogue that was held during the Councils. 

P.s. To be extra clear, I'm not necessarily looking for an explanation which encompasses the scope of the Torah, simply the Christian New and Old Testaments. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It blows my mind that in this enlightened day and age of the smartphone, there still isn't a *free* app on the App Store that very simply takes your inputs for income and expenses and arranges it neatly into a 400-year old accounting standard. All the current offerings on the App Store are either simple expense trackers (i.e. budget apps), or rape you from behind in the backwater woods of Kansas with $35/year subscription fees. 

Can we get something going here? It really doesn't have to be anything inordinately complicated. We just need what basically amounts to a calculator that performs spontaneous double entry overlaid with a material design wrapper. Heck, we could probably just rip off an existing app, beautify it and get it done for less than $1000 all-in, or even hire a fellow Redditor to do it. We could even name it after /r/Accounting and start challenging Intuit   Quickbooks in the small business sector. Anyone else in, or any developers interested?

Update: so it seems in not alone in my frustration! A fellow Big 4 got in touch with me about getting something going once the busy season subsides in April. If you'd be willing to support a project like this, please indicate below! Maybe a mod or someone objective could volunteer to host the Kickstarter? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Financially Distressed and Bankrupt Security Investing Process </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-11 10:38:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **The Financially Distressed and Bankrupt Security
Investing Process**

Investors in financially distressed and bankrupt securities must
concentrate on the corporate balance sheet. Like knowing the
opposing lineups at a baseball game, understanding the
amounts and priorities of a company's liabilities can tell
investors a great deal not only about how the various security
holders are likely to be treated but also how the financial distress
is likely to be resolved.

The first step is to value the assets of the debtor. Once the size
of the pie is known, it is possible to consider how it may be
divided. To facilitate this process, an investor must divide the
debtor's assets into two parts: the assets of the ongoing business;
and the assets available for distribution to creditors upon
reorganization, such as excess cash, assets held for sale, and
investment securities. Investors in AM International, Inc., senior
claims received substantial amounts of AM's excess cash upon
reorganization; investors in Braniff Airlines' first bankruptcy in
1983 received liquidating trust certificates backed by a direct
interest in aircraft assets.

In valuing an ongoing business operating in Chapter 11,
investors should employ each of the valuation methodologies
described in chapter 8. In many instances the investor is in the
difficult position of analyzing a moving target since the business
of the debtor is unstable, if not in turmoil. It is essential
that investors take into account any income statement and cash
flow distortions caused by the Chapter 11 process itself. Interest 
earned on excess cash that builds up during bankruptcy, for
example, will not be a source of income for the reorganized
company. Similarly, interest expense on reinstated debt, which
does not accrue during bankruptcy, will once again accrue.
Then, again, the high investment banking, legal, and administrative
costs of a Chapter 11 proceeding, often cumulatively
totaling several percent or more of the value of the debtor's
estate, will cease upon emergence from bankruptcy. Bankrupt
companies may even intentionally "uglify" their financial statements
(for example, by expensing rather than capitalizing certain
expenses or by building excessive balance sheet reserves) in
order to minimize the assets apparently available for distribution
to creditors. This value is ultimately revealed after reorganization,
but by then insiders have picked up cheap stock or
options.

Analysis of the assets and liabilities of financially distressed
or bankrupt companies must extend beyond the balance
sheet however. Off-balance-sheet assets may include real
estate carried below current value, an overfunded pension
plan, patents owned, and the like. Off-balance-sheet liabilities
may include underfunded pension plans, Internal Revenue
Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and other governmental
claims, and claims resulting from rejected executory contracts
and leases. In recent steel industry bankruptcies, for example,
Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel and LTV Corporation transferred
their underfunded pension plans to the PBGC, resulting in a
bankruptcy claim by the PBGC against Wheeling and protracted
litigation between the PBGC and LTV.

Once a debtor's assets have been valued, investors should
turn their attention to the liability side of the balance sheet. The
liabilities of a bankrupt company are best evaluated in descending
order of seniority. Secured debt should be evaluated first. If
the value of the security interest is determined, whether
through negotiation or a valuation proceeding, to be equal to or
greater than the amount of claim, the claim is said to be fully
secured or oversecured. An oversecured claim entitles the
holder to postpetition accrued interest (interest that would have
accrued during the bankruptcy proceeding) to the extent of the
amount of oversecurity. If secured debt is determined to be less
than fully secured, holders will typically receive value equal to
the extent of their security plus a senior but unsecured claim
against the debtor for the amount of the undersecurity.

There may be some investment opportunities in distressed
securities at every rank in the debt hierarchy. Risk-averse
investors will generally prefer to hold senior securities; the
potential return from senior securities is frequently less than
that available from junior claims, but the risk is also much
lower. Senior securities are first in priority, and unless they are
fully or almost fully repaid, junior classes are unlikely to receive
significant value.

"Fulcrum securities"-the class of securities partly but not
fully covered by asset value-s-can also be attractive investments
at the right price, ranking midway on the risk spectrum. Fulcrum
securities benefit most directly from value increases and likewise
are most directly impaired by any value diminution.
Investing in junior securities can provide spectacular returns
but can also prove disastrous. These securities often serve as
out-of-the-money options-effectively, bets-on an improvement
in operating results or an increase in value.

The common stock of bankrupt companies frequently trades
considerably above its reorganization value, which is often
close to zero. While there may be an occasional horne run, as a
rule investors should avoid the common stock of bankrupt entities
at virtually any price; the risks are great and the returns
very uncertain. Unsophisticated investors have lost a great deal
of money buying the overpriced common stock of bankrupt
companies, even after the unfavorable terms of the reorganization
plan have been widely disseminated.

It is worth remembering that restructurings and bankruptcy
reorganizations are negotiated processes. Negotiations can be
affected by the relative bargaining strengths and weaknesses of 
the different classes of creditors, the skills of the negotiators,
and the dollar amounts at stake.

By way of example, Ron Labow headed an investor group
that bought up most of Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel's bank debt
and dictated a reorganization plan that left him in control of the
reorganized company. A blocking position-one-third of the
outstanding amount of debt-in a small, closely held debt issue
may enable that class to obtain better treatment than similar but
more widely held debt issues. The holder of a blocking position
in even the most junior bankrupt security, because of his or her
ability to delay the debtor's emergence from bankruptcy, may
gain far better treatment for his or her class than allowed by any
allocation made strictly according to priority ranking. A blocking
position is said to have "hold-up" value in two senses: the
owner can hold up (delay) the bankruptcy process as well as
hold up (rob) other classes of creditors, extracting nuisance
value from what might otherwise be a nearly worthless claim.

<TITLE> A Laymans Guide To Understanding Beta </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-11 09:29:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Beta**  

In this article, were going to explore one of the fundamental cornerstones of investing  Risk. What is risk, you may ask? Well, if the finance industry was a person and you were to ask him that question, the answer youd likely get is beta. 

But what is beta? Beta is derived from the second letter of the Greek alphabet, and it is meant to represent the volatility of a security in comparison to a benchmark. Lets say youre planning to evaluate the risk of investing in a companys stock. A suitable benchmark might be the main index of the country in which the company is incorporated  for instance, the S P 500 index or the Dow Jones index for a US company. By comparing the volatility of a securitys trading price to that of its brethren index  which is to say how much its share price moves for every $ the index moves  you get a number, e.g. 2. This means that when the index price moves $1, the share price of the company moves $2 in the same direction as the index. Of course, things arent always as simple as that, since the stock prices of both fluctuate up and down every second; so you really have to use a computer if you want to accurately pinpoint the beta down to a decimal range. 

So why is beta considered a measure of risk? Well, the logic is that if a companys stock moves $2 whenever the index moves $1, it is more risky than the index since you stand to lose double what the index would lose, all else being equal. Since the mantra in the investment world is risk vs reward, that line of reasoning fits well into the established standard. After all, if a stock might go up twice as fast but also might go down twice as fast, doesnt that mean it has higher risk?

However, if you pay attention, you might find that some people who call themselves value investors are shunning the concept of volatility or beta as an ideal measure of risk. You may have heard of the most famous one of them before  Warren Buffett. Yes, the third richest guy in the world. Summarily, Warren says that it is absurd that the risk of an investment should be represented by the volatility of a stock, i.e. how much its share price moves compared to its benchmark. He cites an example  for instance, lets say the share price of a really safe blue-chip stock like American Express drops 50% overnight due to temporary problems (this really happened, and was known as the Salad Oil Scandal). How would investing half your money into 100 American Express shares be more risky than investing all your money for the same 100 shares? Logically, it should only be half as risky, since only half your money is at risk (as opposed to all your money previously). But since beta ignores the underlying conditions of the company and only focuses on the movement of the share price, the subsequent dive would probably reflect a double-digit beta. If one were to studiously follow beta as a measure of risk, he would proceed to view the stock as incredibly risky and perhaps sell it immediately. Whereas what Warren Buffett saw instead was a company trading at a much reduced price, like a discount sale, and he proceeded to buy up as many shares as he reasonably could. The rest is history  he ended up making a lot of money when the share price recovered to earlier levels.

Hence, investors who focus on fundamental analysis of a company might come to the same conclusion that beta is not an ideal measure of risk; since in the above example, the shares were actually least risky when the beta was at its highest. Of course, in most cases volatility actually reflects risk rather well, as when a share price drops there usually is a good underlying reason for that drop. However, in enough cases to be relevant, it causes investors to miss out on potentially good deals, and because of that many people have joined the bandwagon in calling for the end of betas reign as a proper measure of risk.

However, there has to be a reason why beta became the defining measure of risk in the first place. Have you ever asked yourself why beta is considered risk? We all pay lip service to the fact that beta is volatility, and that high volatility equals high risk. But if I were to ask you to explain why beta is risk, would you be able to tell me? What does it mean when we say volatility equals risk? Why do professionals around the world trust hundreds of billions of dollars with it? Why do some denounce it, and who is it useful to (or not)?

 
**What Is Beta?**
  
  
Well, to understand how we came up with the concept of volatility as risk, one has to take a trip down memory lane and go back to high school. Remember all those charts you learnt in eighth grade statistics? The bell curve, those squiggly lines connecting all the randomly placed dots, the mean and the variance? Well, lets refresh your memory. 

[Chart of a stock](http://i.imgur.com/1Dzg8Ct.png)

See, if you look at the chart of any stock, youll notice that its actually a plot of data points seemingly randomly strewn across the chart, with the x-axis representing Price and the y-axis representing Time. Now lets apply some high-school statistics to it. Lets say you wanted to get a mean (average) representation of all the points, so that you can make some sense out of all the random data. How do you do this? You take a ruler, and draw a line at the mid-point between all the data points. Remember, high school? 
 
So now you have a line which represents the average price of the stock at any point in time. But remember, this line is just an average, so trying to use it to represent the actual data may not be so accurate. If all the data points are close to the line, then we call this a close fit  and the line can be said to be a true approximation of all the data points. However, if one particular data point strays far away from the line, then we cant say that the line accurately represents the stock price at that point in time, as the stock price was never near the average price predicted by the line. This is where the concept of volatility comes in.

See, with hundreds of thousands of stocks to look at every day, thats billions of price points for the banks to glean through and try to make some sense of. Hence, simply out of necessity, the banks simplify all the stock prices by averaging them, lest they become overwhelmed by all the information. For each company, they come up with an average line to represent the stock price of the day, month or year.  They then use that line for other things, such as predicting the future stock price by extrapolating it, running a sensitivity analysis  or just putting it into a fancy Powerpoint chart to impress their clients. As a result, they end up relying on these lines (i.e. averages) for many of their crucial functions.

So now weve established that banks have to work on the law of averages, since its impossible to turn a profit crunching a billion data points every single day. However, as weve observed above, sometimes averages are not representative of their true conditions, since a particular price point may stray far away from the average which the line represents. Hence, banks have to come up with a way to account for this imperfection when relying on averages. This is where volatility comes into the picture. 

**What Is Volatility?**

Volatility, in laymans terms, is simply how far the price points on a stock chart stray from the average that the line represents  such that it renders the average inefficient as a representative of actual conditions. For instance, lets say that you plot an average line from a chart of price points of a stock throughout the day. However, assume none of the data points actually sit close to the line; hence, the line only exists as an average of the points, and it sits smack in the middle of all of them. But as each point sits far away from each other, the fact that the average line sits in the middle of all of them doesnt actually mean that the average line accurately represents them. In fact, if you were to solely rely on the line as a fact and try to extrapolate the future price of the stock, you would probably get a very different result from reality. This is because that average line is a poor indicator of what past prices really were; it merely acts a mid-point of all the past prices. In this case, if we were to use the average line as a beginning frame of reference (remember, bank employees rely on the averages out of necessity), we say that the actual prices reflect high volatility from the average. Its just another way of saying that the average is imperfect, and we should be careful when using it. 

So now you know that since its not realistic for banks to individually crunch all prices of every stock at every second (i.e. data points), they instead draw a line through all the prices of a stock throughout the day (or week, month, etc.) and use that average to reflect the entire days price. Then, if a line does not accurately reflect all the price points it is derived from, we say that the line has a high degree of volatility  or imperfection. Likewise, if all the price points sit close to the average that the line represents, we can say that the line is a good representation of the actual data and has a low degree of volatility  or is close to perfect. Thus, using an average price (i.e. line) with higher volatility has more risk, whereas using an average price with less volatility has less risk! 

Hence, this is why we say that volatility (i.e. beta) is risk! 

**But Wait What About The Other Guys?**

So now weve established that volatility is actually a pretty good approximation for risk, by virtue of the fact that we have to rely on average data as opposed to actual data to get our jobs done. And if you pour over the explanation again, beta is actually a pretty good measure of risk. So why do these value investors have a problem with it?

Well, as weve seen, beta is derived from the past performance of stock price. That means that it completely ignores the underlying company which the stock is traded on, and merely observes the price at which it trades at. For instance, lets take the passing of Steve Jobs as an example. When he died, the stock of Apple took a big hit, because people were wondering whether the charismatic nature of the companys leader could be replaced. However, a proper analyst would observe that it takes more than one person to run a hundred billion dollar company  it takes a vertically integrated supply chain, an amazing product, a visible brand, a tip-top management team, as well as tens of thousands of employees to run Apple. So while the departure of the CEO can be viewed as a negative, it is only a blip in the grand scheme of things; at least, as far as the future development of Apple is concerned. However, the emotional side of the market tends to react by driving the stock price because other people are selling, not because of anything that has to do with the fundamental position of the company. In such a case, beta would provide a poor measure of risk  as although volatility shoots through the roof when the stock dives, the company itself is almost completely identical to how it was the day before, just minus one CEO. Most people would say that it would not be any more risky to invest in Apple than it was the day before. In fact, by nature of the stock being cheaper, it would actually be less risky, since you stand to lose less money if you were to buy the same number of stocks. 

Hence, an isolated top-down measurement of risk using only historical price as a benchmark can in many ways be ineffective, if not downright misleading. Some people might say that this is not an issue because the market is an efficient barometer which reflects all available information perfectly (i.e. Efficient Market Hypothesis); however, many of us would agree that the market is not always efficient, and imperfections can and do appear in the market  as weve demonstrated in the above example. As a result, beta as a measure of risk should be taken with a grain of salt. 

**So What Can We Use Beta For?**

This is not to say that beta is completely useless. Like a screwdriver, beta is just a tool  you just have to use it in the manner it was designed for. If you were to apply a screwdriver to a nail, you probably wouldnt make much progress since that wasnt what it was designed for. Likewise, if you were to use beta to measure the fundamental conditions of a company, you may not always get the most accurate results.

However, beta is extremely useful in one case scenario  if you want to be prepared for any eventuality. For instance, lets say you intend to pour all your retirement savings into a stock, and you dont know exactly when you should get out. Hence, you want to be prepared to sell in any eventuality. In such a case, beta can be an excellent measure of risk  since a lower volatility means that you have a lower chance of losing everything, whereas a higher beta means that you have a higher chance of losing likewise. In such a situation, you want to ensure that you dont lose too much no matter what happens  so it would make a lot of sense to pick a stock with a lower beta so that the potential for it to fall drastically is lower. This is one case where observing the historical price movement of a stock in order to define risk can make a lot of sense. However, if we were to apply beta to analysing the fundamental business conditions of a company, you might find yourself disappointed.

This is probably the most layman explanation of Beta on the Internet so I hope youve learned something today!

<TEXT> FOR BETA OR WORSE (pg. 113)

Many market participants believe that investment risk is
intrinsic to specific securities, as it is to activities like hang
gliding and mountain climbing. Using modern financial theory, 
academics and many market professionals have attempted
to quantify this risk with a single statistical measure, beta.
Beta compares a security's or portfolio's historical price fluctuations
with those of the market as a whole. High-beta stocks
are defined as those that tend to rise by a higher percentage
than the average stock in a rising market and decline more
than the average stock in a falling market. Due to their greater
volatility, high-beta stocks are deemed to be riskier than lowbeta
stocks.
I find it preposterous that a single number reflecting past
price fluctuations could be thought to completely describe the
risk in a security. Beta views risk solely from the perspective of
market prices, failing to take into consideration specific business
fundamentals or economic developments. The price level
is also ignored, as if IBM selling at 50 dollars per share would
not be a lower-risk investment than the same IBM at 100 dollars
per share. Beta fails to allow for the influence that investors
themselves can exert on the riskiness of their holdings through
such efforts as proxy contests, shareholder resolutions, communications
with management, or the ultimate purchase of sufficient
stock to gain corporate control and with it direct access to
underlying value. Beta also assumes that the upside potential
and downside risk of any investment are essentially equal,
being simply a function of that investment's volatility compared
with that of the market as a whole. This too is inconsistent
with the world as we know it. The reality is that past
security price volatility does not reliably predict future investment
performance (or even future volatility) and therefore is a
poor measure of risk. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is AAPL still a buy at $130? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-04 04:33:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had put this out of my mind since the split, since after the pre-split pop to $700, I thought the stock had appreciated to fair value. However, recent comments about AAPL maybe getting into the electric car business prompted my interest again. Note that I wasnt interested primarily because of the car rumours; I just wanted to see whether the price it was trading at today still reckoned a second look at value. 

So, as you all might know, my minimum annual ROI for an investment is 15%. I could go into all the other details of AAPL - like how ROE has been steady above 30%, how the cash hoard has grown to nearly $180bn, how Apples debt is manageable, how share buybacks have contributed to 3% CAGR but I wont bother you with all that. Instead, Im just going to distill everything to one criteria  a 15% CAGR.

Since the shares have been trading at around $130 for the past month, lets use that as the entry price. Diluted EPS for the year has been $7.39, which gives AAPL an initial rate of return of 5.68%. Thats far below our required rate of return of 15%. 

However, net profit growth was 6.67% for the past year, which is pretty much what I expect things to remain at unless the company comes up with something new. Remember, were not counting on hope, only hard figures. According to my armchair economists observation, Apples net profit growth has plateaued unless it can come up with another revolutionary device  for the simple reason that there arent any more mass-affluent markets for the iPhone to conquer. After China, Africa and India remain the last two bastions of ginormous population sizes, however the folk there fall below the mass-affluent category and do not present a reliable market for the iPhone. And since over 70% of Apples profits come from the iPhone, its unlikely well see double digit growth if were not considering future revolutionary products.

However, lets not forget that the current profits are still throwing off massive cash flows, which Apple can beneficially employ in share buybacks and other shareholder wealth maximizing programmes. If Apples historical trends continue, we should be able to expect approximately 3% CAGR solely from share buybacks. I think this is a reasonable expectation, and is certainly in-line with other participants in maturing industries like Coca-Cola, IBM and McDonalds. In any case, well add the 3% to the aforementioned 6.67%, which yields us 9.67%.

For conveniences sake, lets round that up to 10%. While you might say that a 0.33% CAGR is not a negligible growth rate to round up, lets just consider that the probability-weighted growth derived from all other product categories, future product categories, as well as other financial engineering exercises. I think 0.33% is quite a safe growth estimate for all these miscellaneous items, especially if you consider further cost efficiency improvements (in which Tim Cook is king). So now we have a 10% yield into perpetuity.

Since this is a value investment, were going to assume that were holding this investment until we die. After all, what sense is there in holding shares of a blue-chip (esque) company if youre not going to hold it until you die? So since we all die at different ages, lets use 30 years as an appropriate timeframe. Im sure well all live for another 30 years, right? Right?

So if we assume an initial 5.68% return, and 10% growth over the next 30 years  plug that into a calculator and you get DING DING DING! A 16.55% CAGR! In case youre wondering, the calculation is: 

 30  (5.68 x 1.130) = 16.55%

Which is awesome. Keep in mind for that return, youre getting a stable quasi-blue chip company which is presently the largest company in the world by market cap. Now, lets examine the inherent risks in the assumptions used.

Some critics have pointed out that Apple relies on a single product, the iPhone, to generate almost all of its profits - and that in the realm of technology, where things can change in the blink of an eye, the incumbents position is generally not secured over the long term. However, I think thats just one side of the coin. IBM, Oracle, Sun, Microsoft, and Intel have all made pretty strong cases that large-cap technology incumbents can maintain their existence into perpetuity - even if it means yielding the top spot to a young upstart. Whats important is that: 1) they have loads and loads of cash to weather a market downturn  which Apple has, and 2) they have capable, shareholder-friendly management which adequately understands their risk:reward profile, which Apple does. If the tech incumbent has both, I think its safe to assume a 6.67% internally generated growth rate into perpetuity. 

The bonus at the end of all of this is that Apple may not yet be done with being THE BEST  NUMBER ONE! in its field. The iPad still has some game to catch up, but it presently still holds more than 40% market share... and that's still an open market for Apple to pursue. The Apple Watch is supposed to be a breakthrough device. well see about that. But theres good reason to be optimistic about an extra 1% growth from it. And the Apple Car wow, that would be fantastic if it would just do us a favour and exit the realm of rumours and fairy tales. In any case, these developments are just the proverbial icing on the cake. 

Anyway, the point is that Apples future is bright. Even without all these revolutionary changes, itll still yield our minimum rate of return, while providing the inherent security of investment of a large-cap. And that's good enough for me.

<TITLE> Value Investing Analysis 1: SapuraKencana (5218.KL) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-11 06:42:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  Ok I promised /u/Piospro a value investing post, so here's one. The entire post is 14 pages worth of Word, so given the 10,000 charcter limit I'll only be posting the first few pages here. You can read the rest on my blog: http://investingmy.com/sapurakencana-5218-kl/

 Anyway, just to tl;dr, this is a company I feel pretty good about. Feel free to share your opinions.



**BACKGROUND**  
SapuraKencana. What is it?
It used to be solely in the oil and gas services industry, laying pipes for upstream suppliers. The company started out as Sapura Bhd, which was specifically involved in OCSS (Offshore Construction and Subsea Services), before merging with Kencana Bhd in 2012 which was primarily a FHUC (fabrication, hook-up and commissioning) provider.
Basically, the oil and gas industry is broken into 3 different industries  upstream suppliers who do the actual drilling and procurement of oil, midstream suppliers laying the pipelines or providing the equipment for the upstream suppliers (i.e. transportation of oil), and downstream suppliers who do the processing and refining to turn the crude oil into something actually usable, such as petrol or kerosene. Then there are the integrated oil majors, sometimes known as integrated oil or super majors, such as ExxonMobil, BP or Shell, which do all three.
Sapurakencana in this context used to be a midstream supplier, laying the pipeline and transporting oil for the large oil and gas majors in places where they dont deem it feasible to do it themselves. It also supplies oil rigs to these companies so that they are able to drill the oil in the first place. 
However, with the recent acquisition of Newfield Malaysia in 2013, SapuraKencana has effectively dipped into the upstream market by participating in the actual drilling for oil. It is clear with the recent acquisitions that its CEO, Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin (Shahril) is trying to transform SapuraKencana into an integrated oil major. In the same year, SapuraKencana acquired the entire tender rig division of Seadrill Ltd, a major midstream player in the US market, in exchange for some cash and a 12% stake in SapuraKencana (which has since been pared down to 8%). This effectively made it the largest tender rig operator in the world. 



**RUNNING THE NUMBERS**  
**Net profit**  
Net profit has shown pretty decent y-o-y growth, rising 60% last year and projected to match last years performance this year. 3Q/2015 results have already surpassed the previous years full year results by 16%. Revenues also increased proportionally, likely coming from the acquisitions. 
Depreciation for the nine months to 3Q/2015 was RM 829,919, while finance costs were RM 513,459. Im going to assume that CAPEX for the next 3 years or so is going to average about RM 1Bn, based on the depreciation figure. Finance costs on the other hand are a bit troubling. As well see later, debt has been rising even after the acquisition.

**Capital structure**  
The company has approximately 6 billion shares outstanding, giving it a market capitalization of around RM 17bn at the current share price of RM 2.80. In comparison, it has a whopping RM 14bn in debt which incurred interest of RM 500m in the nine months leading up to 3Q/2015. Debt:equity is 1.2x; which does not factor in payables, which if included brings the liabilities:equity ratio to 1.8x (high payables is common in oil   gas companies). At this point, the company is levered to the hilt. The fact that it was able to reach this point is impressive in itself, much less any consideration that it might be able to further increase its leverage. Im sure its strong brand in the region had been a key factor in helping it acquire this magnitude of financing in the first place. 
The first question which springs to anyones mind is whether the company can continue to service its interest and principal obligations, in the context of the falling oil price environment. Its unlikely we will ever see $100/barrel oil again, although consensus is that oil will revert back to about $60-$70 in two to three years time. So the question is, can SapuraKencana survive over the next two to three years?

The answer is a resounding, if not quite reassuring, yes. The company has a RM 30 bn orderbook, which at current revenue levels is enough to maintain performance for the next three years, albeit at zero (or possibly negative) growth. Obviously, things are not as straightforward as that, however if the company can continue populating its orderbook at even slightly slower rates, it should be fine. Alliance Bank states that the company would have to maintain its orderbook to sustain its contract burn rates. Even in the worst case scenario, the company is well-recognised and well-connected enough that refinancing debt (albeit at higher interest rates) is always an option.
Having said that, the bigger question and the elephant in the room, is whether the company can redeem its debt in full in a reasonable amount of time. Any debt which remains on the balance sheet will incur interest charges, which represent a fixed share of profits going to debtholders. For reasons yet unapparent until the 2015 financial statements come out, it seems that debt has increased by RM 3bn in the nine months to 3Q/2015 despite no significant acquisitions taking place, not including an additional RM8bn Islamic note signed in Jan 2015 which was not captured in the 3Q/2015 statements. No equity investor in his right mind would buy shares at the current price (9 Feb 2015: RM 2.80) without a serious plan in place to reduce the debt burden. The CEO has said he expects to debt reduce to US$ 3bn in 3 years; however, how he plans to do that while maintaining present growth rates is anyones guess. Debt:equity levels have to reduce within the next 10 years AT MOST  without artificially diluting equity holder  if equity investors which to see a profitable ROI on their investments today. 

In any case, here are some finer details about the debt. Interest payments are currently at about 4% of debt  some sources claim that it is 1-2%, although Im not sure how theyre getting to that. The 4% figure is impressive anyhow, given that corporate debt on the largest companies in the US is going for about 5% average. This is no doubt contributed by two factors: firstly, its brand and connections to the Malaysian government (a bailout in the event of a catastrophe is highly likely), and the fact that it has access to international barrel-scrapping interest rates. A few minor points to note are that: i) the debt is denominated in USD, ii) the company doesnt really participate in any currency hedging, and iii) the recent spike in MYR-USD rates have been beneficial for the company since it reports earnings in MYR.
Another related possible cause for concern is that RM 9bn (possibly increased since Jan 2014) of debt is maturing and payable in 2 years. Thats right folks; it has to front RM 1.50/share of debt within 2 years, something which is only possible via refinancing. While this is no cause for alarm due to the high likelihood of refinancing, remarkably little details have been provided regarding what this debt relates to and why the maturity date is so short for such a staggering amount of debt, as well as why it was structured so unusually to begin with. Is it a bridging loan for the eventual sukuk-tization of the debt? Was it a sale and leaseback agreement for the Seadrill assets? Nobody really knows. Its something to stay incredibly conscious about, thats for sure. 
In any case, heres the bottom line. As weve explored above, the company is in growth mode and is expected to continue its impressive rate of growth through further acquisitions, given its vision of becoming a fully integrated oil major. Since oil and gas companies do not typically have a lot of free cash flow (FCF) after reinvestment, it can only do so in one of two ways: take on more debt or issue equity and dilute shareholders. So far, management has been extremely prescient about the effects of diluting shareholders, and theoretically picking up debt is an optimal way of maximizing returns. However, it is approaching dangerously close to the possibility of default risk in the event of a global economic catastrophe. For instance, if a hypothetical world war were to suddenly break out, the company would definitely fold. 

I wont go into a full breakdown of each segments performance, as my goal with this article is to give you a broad overview of the company with enough detail to fill in the blanks yourself, but not to unnecessarily overwhelm you with numbers. If you need a more detailed breakdown in one or two areas, I hope you can do a simple Google search which can bring you directly to the source, as opposed to me throwing the entire kitchen sink at you (which will make this article about 3x longer). I found a good site which aggregated the majority of its past three quarters performance here: http://m.kinibiz.com/tag/shahrilshamsuddin
In any case, it seems that the companys cost management has been ebbing up and down over time. Its not a cause for concern but it indicates that successfully battling the two fronts of stellar revenue growth coupled with excellent cost management is not an expectation you should hold dearly should you decide to become an investor. 

**Other**  
Besides that, none of the numbers represent anything out of the ordinary. You can scan them yourselves in the balance sheet, profit   loss and cash flow figures in the tables above; the material items from each statement are listed below their respective tables. 



**ANALYSIS**  
Ok, so heres the lowdown on the company. As you all should already know, the company has been going on a massive shopping spree over the past few years. Starting in 2012, it merged with Kencana Bhd to form SapuraKencana as we know it today....

This is not going to happen. Musk has no idea what he's getting into.

I worked on the original Iridium satellite phone project. I built a simulator for the entire network, and the handset uplink bandwidth was 2400 baud. Yep. Just 2400 bits per second.

Now we can do things like improve coding efficiency and maybe add a little bit more power to the satellites (although Iridium satellites are huge already) or perhaps bring them a little closer to earth, and at the very best case we might get 10x improvement. So now we're up to 100kbps.

That's not even 2G speeds. And who's going to want that, especially now that 3rd world countries have already solved the internet-access problem with 4G-LTE cell towers?

If you want faster speeds, you'll need expensive tracking dishes or phased-array antennas, and at this point your market size dramatically decreased. Pretty soon your market is going to only be 10,000 or so airplanes and ships. That's it. (lol @ the idea that there's going to be 200 million customers.. try 20,000 instead.)

After all that, you'll still never get close to fiber-optic speeds, which are hitting 10GBps now for the corporate world, literally a MILLION times faster, and doesn't have the power-cost problem that wireless does.

Sorry Elon Musk, but this is a dead-end project. Many smart people have already tried to solve this and failed, and you're not adding anything new. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Constructing an asset allocation model for optimal geographical diversification </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-09 16:58:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A client recently tasked us with creating a relatively simple asset allocation model for optimal geographical diversification. We're a relatively small shop, so we usually don't create models - we just work out the details in our heads and make the decision. Since it's a low priority concern, the job was delegated and re-delegated until it's reached me. So... here I am, seeking advice on reddit.

I've been doing my own research for awhile before it crossed my mind that some of you here may have done it before. Basically, what I've done so far is just a basic risk parity model and constructed an efficient frontier, which might satisfy someone who hasn't seen one before (i.e. the client) but probably not my bosses. I don't think he's looking for a full blown statistical thesis on the relationship between Brazillian oil wells and Chinese political dynasties, but if anyone could share their experience it would be greatly appreciated. For context, we're looking at 4 regions - USA, Asia Pacific, China   ASEAN. 

Thanks!

P.S. I've seen some of the geographical diversification studies while Googling around -  it doesn't need to be that complicated. We're just looking for something respectable which can still be explained to the laymen.  </TEXT>
