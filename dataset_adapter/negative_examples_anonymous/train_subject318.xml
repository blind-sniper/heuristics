<TEXT> I can kind of understand. Mine just lost his job and now stays up until 3 am (usually I'm expected to also stay up) and sleeps in until midday. Wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't dealing with horrible morning sickness and a teething toddler haha. 

Edit: He's a couple years my senior so same thing. He's always right lol.

<TITLE> What's your opinion on Lemon Lime Bitters when pregnant? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have a cousins 21st dinner and can't order the usual water or juice without giving away the pregnancy. They know I wouldn't pass up a drink or two otherwise. 

I've seen lemon lime bitters served to children. But was recently informed they still contain alcohol. Should a glass or two with tea matter? or have you any other suggestions as to drinks that appear alcoholic but aren't? Haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sisters 8th birthday. She invited over 20 people to come see a movie and have lunch. After a couple hours she started getting upset since no one had showed up. People had called to confirm the date but Mum and I told her we must have put the wrong dates on the invites and took her home. She never wanted birthday partys after that.  </TEXT>
