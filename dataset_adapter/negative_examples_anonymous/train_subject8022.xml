<TEXT> The Eastern side of the state is getting hit particularly hard, including much of Idaho. It's really bad, but at the same time it's really interesting. If you like adventure, I highly suggest checking out some of the record low lakes and rivers around. Parts of the Snoqualmie river for example are a trickle right now in areas that'd be over a person's head in a normal water year. Keechelus Lake is another interesting place along I-90, and with its record lows right now it's a lot of fun to hike/explore areas usually under water this time of year. 

If we have another mostly snowless winter I think we'll be in super super bad shape. So hopefully checking out record low bodies of water is a limited time offer only. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It bothers me that you appear to be one of "them"... But the reason was to get away from the brigading caused by one stupid comment. I was very active in programming and financial/investing subreddits where people had a lot of questions. I'd contribute efforts to help those seeking help, but when all my comments were downvoted by the SRS members it was a bad deal because it made my advice look like the wrong advice, and could have an impact on those asking for advice. It still doesn't make sense to me... This was a couple of years ago so maybe SRS has changed, but back then their actions were completely inappropriate imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> SRS thrives on harassment and they really need to go... I had to create a new reddit account because I made a joke about feminists with my last one, not even meaning to offend anyone. There was a post about some misguided feminists at a rally that attacked a photographer for doing his job, and I posted a comment like "I volunteer to be the bus driver for the next rally... But our first stop will be a cliff.". SRS found out and followed me around downvoting me. They also doxxed me, found out where I worked, and tried to get me fired... All because I made a stupid comment which I don't think any reasonable person would associate with being serious.

This went on for months before I deleted my account, and it caused me a lot of stress. If that's not the definition of harassment I don't know what is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think small drones with mounted projectile weapons will be the future of warfare. It won't be long before they start making appearances in insurgencies however, then regulators in the states will probably go nuts.

Or just imagine how much damage could be done with drones and explosives that have either encrypted / frequency jumping communication or pre-programmed GPS routes. It's a defense nightmare. About all you can do today is construct a giant net around what you're trying to protect, and even that isn't very feasible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This doesn't seem like a bad thing. It's really easy to circumvent if you really want too, but it also offers protection to common users who want their privacy.

Imagine the scenario:


**With protection on the image and platform**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. The image is set to be viewed only once. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. The client/platform allows person B to view it, but it also triggers the image to become protected/encrypted. It is now no longer viewable. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer finds the image but cannot view it.

**Without protection**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer is cleaning up data on the machine and comes across the image, opens it, and can view it. Now the buyer can post it on the internet, keep it on his machine for viewing, and just be generally creepy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> oDesk used to be very good. It has since been renamed to [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/) . However with bidding sites such as that you'll likely find you are competing against many developers in other countries who are far more willing to work for less compensation.

If you don't want to start your own side project, one way to get side work is to post on sites such as Craigslist, and/or look for requests for help requests in the 'gigs' section. For example for Seattle, there are quite a few 'gigs' available: https://seattle.craigslist.org/search/cpg

Just be careful to not break any contracts with your employer, such as working on a project for competition.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've screened a lot of resumes and done quite a few in-person interviews as a developer.

My suggestions (Specific):

* Instead of listing "C++/CLI" under languages just put "Managed C++". 

* For frameworks just put ".NET" instead of listing 4.0 and 4.5

* Drop the Methodologies bullet point. It doesn't really add anything useful.

* "real-time streaming SQL queries" seems like a poor description. I'd suggest something like "using SQL integration to display data"
* For the second job, combine the 2nd and 3rd bullet points.
* "The end result of the project would be a poker bot". This is a big red flag for me. You say "would be"? So this is an unfinished project I assume? If it is, either finish it, reword the description, or remove it all together. Personal projects are a huge bonus when I read resumes, but a single unfinished project gives me a negative perspective unless it's actively under development. 

For the short jobs, there isn't much you can do about that, just be honest. 
 
My suggestions (General):

* If you can list some accomplishments for your last job. Did you improve anything greatly while there?

<TEXT> While the implementation itself may be proprietary, the concepts themselves are likely not. This seems common, especially in companies working on enterprise-level projects.

As long as you aren't stuck in maintenance mode (ie: not adding anything new, and not learning anything new about the projects) I don't think it'll do much to limit your career growth potential. I would suggest keeping yourself busy with side-projects wherever you can, just so you don't fall into a rut of not being motivated to learn anything new.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think part of the reason ageism exists is because unlike the case with young hires, with older hires there is usually a much longer paper trail and job/performance history. I think a lot of interviewers see an older person's resume and think "they aren't as far along as I think they should be after so many years in the industry", and conversely upon seeing a young person's resume they think "this person has worked a couple of years on satisfying projects, his future is likely very bright"... But the whole comparison is unfair, because the vast majority of tech workers won't accomplish something that is front page worthy in their careers. Yet that does not mean they aren't extremely good workers to have by your side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The FDA allows "compassionate care" use of previously unapproved treatments if it has a chance of improving the quality of life of someone who has a severely degraded quality of life or outlook. It's risky to drug manufacturers however, because if they attempt to treat patients too early, before doses/tolerance/safety are worked out in phased population studies, there is a chance it could make a patient's condition worse or even kill them. Such an event can put a real black mark on their ability to continue research and get approval in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You would have been close to the recommended maximum payload for sure. Looking at your truck's specs its bed is 4.8ft long (usable space), 56 inches wide, and has a depth of 18 inches. Subtracting 4 cubic feet for the wheel wells (it's likely more), and 2 cubic feet for the unused space on top we come out to about exactly 1 cubic yard. Since your soil looks dry and also uncompacted it's probably a few hundred less than the typical 2,000 lb for 1 cubic yard estimate.

Your truck's manufacturer lists a max recommended cargo payload of around 1400lb, which is likely very conservative (because lawsuits). 

With the weight being evenly distributed across the bed there shouldn't be any extreme stress on one particular point unless you're cruising around sharp corners at 30 MPH. 

When I lived/worked on a farm we would regularly exceed max payload specs as long as we kept the weight uniform and drove carefully. We never had any mechanical issues related to weight, and I don't suspect you have anything to worry about either. But I wouldn't recommend packing it down or taking wet soil and filling it to the top =) </TEXT>

The locks raise the water level by ~20 feet so to lose all of that would imply there was almost no inflow at all. Is that expected? If so does anyone know if water restrictions are planned to maintain the Cedar River flows? I've lived here for about 10 years and there haven't been any water restrictions during that period, are watering restrictions super rare in this area?

<TEXT> I remember reading somewhere that 2015 already has more units approved for construction than all of 2014 (which was already an active year). The boom is happening, but it's nowhere near enough to bring prices down. Seattle is now estimated to be adding nearly 30k people to its population each year, but suburbs are of course adding many more than that so demand for housing in the city is continuing to rapidly rise and likely will for a long time in the future.

Builders have every incentive to build right now, and I think they are building as fast as they can. There is just such an influx of people wanting to move to Seattle there is no way they can keep up with their current staffing and building capabilities. I'm not sure what more the city of Seattle can do to increase construction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it is likely unethical, but is it actually illegal if there are no investors and the company is private? It's not for tax purposes either, but simply because due to the nature of the business a higher  previous customer count is incredibly crucial to gaining more customers.

For example, say I start a security system company. If I were to say "More installations than any other security provider!", is that illegal if it is not true? Just to clarify, I'm not asking about ethics here but rather the legality of it. </TEXT>

Many of the guys I know who had kids when they were in their 20s did so because either they didn't want to wear a condom due to reduced sensations, or because their girlfriends forget to take the pill (or in some messed up situations told them they were taking it, but actually were not).

A lot of banks have easy ways to send out electronic checks, and I've found that is the simplest. I also use something offered by Chase called Chase Quickpay.

<TEXT> Modern Turkish history is full of coups, there were two successful coups not long before the one in 1980. The 1980 coup would have happened regardless of American involvement, and based on previous history it was almost guaranteed that it too would be a successful coup... so I don't think the US can be blamed for causing such a change, as it was inevitable.

So unless they build them in the middle of the desert, the reaction from nearby residents might be overwhelming enough to keep them from building new plants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It hasn't been a military dictatorship for day to day politics. The military has upheld a secular Turkey in the past when leaders have moved away from it. I would say the reason Turkey has remained a model secular state for so long is BECAUSE of the the military. As Erdogan has gained more and more power he has targeted some existing military leadership as 'opposition' and worked to lessen there power... I'm hopeful the military will step in at some point and warn Erdogan against making more anti-secular moves.  </TEXT>

This is the incident I'm referring to: http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763 . Though I wouldn't be surprised if there are more. The publishers included Springer and IEEE, both of which are well trusted publishers:

 Ruth Francis, UK head of communications at Springer, says that the company has contacted editors, and is trying to contact authors, about the issues surrounding the articles that are coming down. The relevant conference proceedings were peer reviewed, she confirms  making it more mystifying that the papers were accepted.

 The IEEE would not say, however, whether it had contacted the authors or editors of the suspected SCIgen papers, or whether submissions for the relevant conferences were supposed to be peer reviewed. We continue to follow strict governance guidelines for evaluating IEEE conferences and publications, Stickel said. </TEXT>

It's not just infamously bad journals publishing fake papers, it's been a problem with other journals as well. A couple of years ago a CS team at a university created a paper generator and submitted the papers to some well known and generally trusted journals, and the papers were published even though they were non-nonsensical.

<TEXT> Though at a certain point the composition of the atmosphere would take effect, the primary factor behind tree lines is temperature. At a certain point it becomes too cold for the species to survive, or there is too much moisture that remains as snow cover for them to get started.

The atmospheric composition statement can quickly be debunked by comparing altitudes of tree lines across different regions. In tropical and warmer climates you'll find trees at much higher altitudes (in many cases all the way to the mountain tops), where as in colder climates the tree lines will generally be much lower. If the primary factor were atmospheric composition you'd find tree lines across the world were much more uniform in altitude. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Less than 24 hours isn't nearly enough time of advance notice on mass media if you want a lot of people to attend your rally. Not only do people have to make the decision of whether they want to go or not, they'd also need time to plan for it.

If you want a real protest call it something like a "Rally for US" or "Rally for Freedom", and start spreading information about which cities are selected for demonstrations, at least a week in advance (even if the bill passes by then, with a big enough protest it's possible the demonstrations will spark calls to revoke the bill from within the senate).

Make those on social media feel like they 'are' the rally movement, and not just merely invited to someone else's party.

And last but not least, make sure you get volunteers to bring food. Protests will never last long without food vendors. Iron fisted governments target food vendors with high priority when looking to quell a protest, but I suspect you will not have that issue in the US.

Good luck. :) </TEXT>

Truck, bus, delivery, and taxi drivers account for nearly 6 million professional driving jobs. **Virtually all of these jobs will be eliminated within 10-15 years, and this list is by no means exhaustive.**"

This seems incredibly unlikely. Even if fully automated cars/trucks are commonly available by them, the switch is still going to be very gradual. A lot of people will still want their own cars even if they're automated, and it will likely take decades to transition there. Delivery companies don't have unlimited capital, and there are a lot of small companies out there, they aren't going to just switch the moment automated trucks become available.

I look forward to automated cars/trucks, but let's be realistic about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd love to see dedicated and potentially elevated bike routes developed in cities like Seattle. I'm an avid biker, and love riding on the weekends on trails, but even still there is no way I'd feel confident enough to get on one of the existing 'bike lanes' along the busy road. I'm sure if cities developed bike routes where riders didn't have to worry about crossing and riding alongside car traffic, the number of riders biking to and from work would explode. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looks awesome. 

Will you be using the storage tanks for drinking water too? If so you may want to check with the feed store, they look like poly tanks. While growing up out in the country years ago, we had a neighbor who wanted to setup poly tanks from the feed store for drinking water, but was told they are unsafe because chemicals leak out and they are often treated with fire retardants. It's probably fine, but you may wish to dig for a little more info about the tanks.

Edit: I should mention they did eventually setup poly tanks, but they had to get tanks that were certified to be safe for drinking water.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately a lot of bacterial diseases are headed in this direction. The effective antibiotics left to treat them usually come with super high cost and very unwelcome side effects. Additionally there is a rather scary scenario where a previously antibiotic resistant infection responds to a different class of antibiotic, but by then it results in an opportunistic infection with resistant c. diff. bacteria. C.Diff bacteria is now highly resistant to antibiotics and kills more than 30,000 people each year in the US alone. </TEXT>

I moved to the Seattle area 10 years ago and it used to be smooth flowing traffic on the Eastside for the most part. Now it's a crawl. In Newcastle they are building a 900 unit condo/apartment complex without any major road modifications. 5 years from now we will likely look back on today's traffic with fondness =( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up on a farm and was told by the chemical reps that Roundup was perfectly safe, so as a kid I was sent down into the canyons near our farm to spray out Canadian Thistles with a backpack sprayer full of roundup. Sometimes I'd come back soaked with it from blowback that came from the nozzle. I now have a lot of health issues, and it's clear Roundup is not as safe as Monsanto claims... but I had extremely heavy exposure as did my siblings and neighbors, and there were no acute effects from it. I find many cases of children dying from being near sprayed coca plantations in Columbia unlikely. If it's true children are dying near the sprayed coca, it must either be from something else besides Roundup, or they are being exposed to heavy quantities of Roundup in some other way. Getting caught in the spray from a helicopter/plane is not that much exposure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus. Everybody in the initial situation lacked street smarts. If you see people fighting/arguing without many other bystanders around, standing in the middle of the street and recording them, and then being somewhat verbally combative with them is not a smart move. It's likely only going to escalate the situation.

It seems pretty common for people to get into arguments near  bars when I'm in Idaho, and when that happens I'll just chill inconspicuously nearby either alone or with friends. In almost all cases either the argument burns out, or the cops come... But if I were to stand in the street obviously filming them when they were already running on adrenaline, nothing good is going to come of it.

Hopefully this guy now knows he shouldn't try the 'in your face' type filming he does with police; with ordinary people already distressed... without expecting escalation. </TEXT>

The first time the cops showed up they were prepared for a criminal (hands on guns, flashlights in my eyes). But by the 4th time they just BSed with me and finally told the couple to stop calling the police.

I'm not sure what made the couple think burglars would bring stuff into the house instead of taking it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you look up specs for your SSD you'll see the data retention rate in the spec. For consumer level drives it is typically 3 months. For example here is a spec for Seagate drives: http://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/ssd-fam/600-pro-ssd/en-us/docs/100727924b.pdf . Section 2.1 lists the data retention rate.

As far as how the data is lost, assuming manufacturing quality is generally consistent across the drive... you'll theoretically lose the cells with the most write cycles first. Most consumer drives store 2 bits per cell, so you'll be losing 2 bits at the lowest level, but depending on how the flash controller is designed you'll likely be losing larger blocks of data once you hit the data retention threshold under the right conditions.

Most people will likely be able to store the data for years without problems. The data retention period is basically what the manufacturer is guaranteeing with their spec before they see any risk. 

**Edit:** I looked up a Sandisk whitepaper about a controller  (http://www.sandisk.com/assets/docs/NetApp%20Write-Intensive%20SSD%20White%20Paper.pdf) and it has a good write-up about data retention:

 We work closely with OEM partners to provide needed device-replacement guidance, as well as information
related to expected data retention (that is, how long the flash media can retain data before it becomes
unreliable). It is important to be aware that there is a limited data retention period once SSDs have been
removed from service (that is, powered off). Retention is also dependent on operating and storage temperatures
and the endurance remaining on the device when it was taken out of service. Although the data retention
period for some HDDs can be measured in years, SSD retention is more typically measured in weeks or days
once the device is powered off. The Lightning Write-Intensive SAS SSDs are capable data retention of 90 days
at end of life </TEXT>

<TEXT> They still have some lesser-known hurdles to overcome, most consumer drives have a relatively low data retention period of ~3 months. What is a "data retention period" for SSDs? It's the length of time the manufacture claims you can have an SSD powered off before it'll begin to lose data.

Unlike mechanical magnetic hard-drives, today's SSDs need to be periodically powered on or else they will begin to lose data. I don't think many people realize this, even those using them in enterprise solutions. So mechanical hard drives won't be able to be replaced by SSDs at the consumer level for all scenarios, until consumer SSDs data retention rates improve, even if SSDs are eventually cheaper. For this reason, we probably won't be seeing any trustworthy external backup drives using SSDs for a long while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm friends with a girl who cammed, and she probably made more than me, and I'm making a very decent living. We dated/hung out for a while and I helped her get her own website up where she'd direct viewers from her cam shows... Some days she'd spend an entire afternoon/evening cam'ing and make several thousand dollars.

Eventually she stopped because she wanted to be a good role model for her young daughter (though it's not like her kid was around when she was on the cam), but I'm sure she made well over two hundred thousand in a relatively short period of time, because she bought a condo in downtown Seattle. It was crazy. It was also awkward at times, because here I was working my career and saving for a house, and she was pretty much getting more money thrown at her for talking and dancing at home... But I don't hate on it, it's a much much safer way for a girl to make quick money than some of the alternatives, especially if they are smart about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently renting a house up on a hill with a lake and city skyline view in a really wealthy neighborhood. The house is much older than those around it, and my previous landlord sold it last summer to a guy that plans to build a mansion on it starting in June. When he came over to check out the view, he was annoyed that the neighbors chimney and part of the roof obstructed some of the view. So he bought the neighbor's house, and is going to tear it down so he can have a better view.

I make a reasonable amount of money through my salary and investments, but this guy is rich like I've never seen before.

<TEXT> I think it's a trade off between the risk you're willing to take. To get those kind of returns in the current market you'll likely need a somewhat aggressive fund, which presents a relatively high risk. The past few years have offered great returns on most mutual funds, but I think things are starting to slow down and volatility is returning.

If you own the property and it's insured, your risk there is low, assuming you can continue to find renters. What region is the property in? I'd suggest checking out a site like Zillow to get property value estimates and see what kind of appreciation is occurring in your market area. If appreciation is high, you'll get multiple bonuses... As home prices go up generally rent prices rise as well due to higher demand, and of course you'll be able to get a better return when you do choose to sell. </TEXT>

Not all funds can be transferred in this way however. I'm not sure about the exact definition of what can or cannot be transferred through ACATS, but in the past my transfers from one brokerage to another did not allow some foreign stocks from a mutual fund to be transferred. Those foreign stocks had to be liquidated, and the funds transferred separately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think for some this could be even more traumatizing, so care should be taken to ensure such a gift won't cause more breakdowns. For example my great grandmother had Alzheimer's, and as it advanced she lost more and more recent memories, including the death of her husband. When she'd see a picture of him, or hear his name, she'd become excited and ask for us to call him and have him join us (at family dinners). She'd be so persistent that she'd have to be reminded he had passed away, and each time it was like she was being told for the first time.. it was very traumatizing. We tried to keep discussions relevant to current events in order to avoid such triggers. I think in cases like hers, providing photos of the past may be better off avoided. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started tracking my sleep 2 years ago along with other health indicators so I could better make 'tweaks' and see a response in the data. Right now I'm at 5.6 hours of sleep on average (and that's with a few nights of 8 hours in there too) for the last 14 days, which is nearing an all time low. Now I'm paranoid about the lack of sleep and being unable to get back on track... which makes me more paranoid that I won't be able to fall asleep, and therefore I can't fall asleep easily due to the anxiety. 

I think the worst thing someone can do for sleep is to start to worry about the sleep. It's what always sets it off for me. If I don't have to wake up at a specific time for work or an appointment it's a lot easier for me to fall asleep, but the moment I have an upcoming responsibility that's dependent on getting a good night of sleep, everything goes to hell in a handbasket.

If anyone has any tips for avoiding negative thoughts about sleep, that'd be awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm on the team of a prominent software company that develops  prominent security software, and as such I have access to articles and the latest research in the security inner circles. Most of the news reports concerning this malicious firmware are inaccurate due to misunderstanding in both the general media and the general population.

This is a targeted attack, not an attack that affects everyone with a recent hard-drive. This is malicious firmware being flashed onto the devices AFTER manufacturing and packaging. Not during. This isn't the first time we've seen such malware, the difference this time is that the targets are so clear. What's happening here is that there is a middle-man between shipments from the hard-drive manufacturers and/or the retailers selling to the governments in question.

It takes a lot of resources to intercept drives, flash them, re-package them, and send them on their way. It's also possible a 'fake' seller/retailer has been granted sale contracts to these governments. The common user has no reason to worry, unless they work for the Russian government in a high profile position.  </TEXT>

What I suspect this is, is simply a monitoring system on an existing surveillance network, where the new tool crawls sites that are revealed through non-tunneled or encrypted requests. It's definitely not going to kill the 'dark web'. It'll just make it easier to discover criminal sites where the addresses were previously not revealed outside of the user base. </TEXT>

All but one officer has been extremely polite to me, and that includes city officers in addition to sheriffs and State Patrol. 

Most of the US videos I see where the officer is being an 'asshole' the person with the camera is not being polite either. Saying "am I being detained" over and over is not going to result in a polite conversation. I think with cops in pretty much any developed country, if you treat them with respect, they will treat you with respect. </TEXT>

This study seems a bit odd. Reported results were subjective, and there is nothing substantiating that the patients were not still at a major cognitive deficit.

It's Reddit's Achilles heel. Such bots could network together or use embedded upvote/downvote logic to wreak havoc on Reddit.

It only sank once, and it wasn't very far from the shore, out where I expected I could wade out and get it. But as I watched the crystal clear waters it kept sinking, and sinking... and sinking.  I watched it sink probably 15 feet all the way to the bottom. From the shore it looked like the water would only be a few feet deep. Nope nope nope nope. </TEXT>

The Canadian attack was considered terrorism related because it was an attack against the government, and the ideology behind it was driven by a call from ISIS for lone wolf attacks against governments. It was not a hate crime.

The Australian attack was similar, and was directed towards the general public of a country labeled an enemy by ISIS. In that case too the man behind the attack was driven by ISIS, and even had victims hold up an Islamic State flag.

<TEXT> It's due to levels of neurotransmitters in your brain changing due to large variety of physiological, environmental, and emotional factors. There are likely a lot of neurotransmitters in play that have a huge impact on motivation, but currently the most well-known is one called "Dopamine". 

People who have disorders involving dopamine regulation dysfunction (such as Parkinson's, some forms of Depression, MS, etc) have severe disruption in motivation. The lower the dopamine production/uptake, the lower the motivation. They lack what would be considered a normal motivation drive, and typically see improvements in this motivation when undergoing pharmaceutical therapy to increase levels of dopamine.

So what can you do to influence dopamine? Well, the field is still very young and is full of unknowns, but it seems that one way to increase dopamine in healthy individuals is to have them partake in activities they **enjoy**. Exercise also has an effect on dopamine levels and as a result may increase levels of motivation. 

So if you're feeling unmotivated, perhaps it'd be wise to spend some time among friends or go for a quick jog/walk/bike ride before returning to your work. It could have a very positive impact. </TEXT>

However recently I've definitely seen a big uptick in the number of active stores and customers in the malls around my region.

If they are estimating the collapse based on the dwindling number of new malls being built that seems like a poor metric. Many of those malls built prior to 2008 were bad ideas, and now the backers realize that... so why would they build more? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because of rising nationalism and the perception that people are willing to sacrifice more to expand their country. If he backs down now Russia will look weak, mostly because of the language used by both sides in their "demands". Russia leadership has to make it look like they've won something, and they likely bit off more than they can chew when they weren't satisfied with Crimea. If they lose ground Russia will appear weak and nationalism will fall, and meanwhile the economy will still be in tatters. 

I think they also want to make a strong statement for why Baltic states should not move towards NATO, and it's because of the threat of "separatism" (aka being invaded by Russia under a guise).  Imposing fear of demise (country, person or otherwise) is a tactic that works well. Just look at the case of former KGB agent that was poisoned with plutonium in Western Europe after publicly challenging Putin and his ways. You can bet your ass such people will now be much more hesitant to publicly criticize Putin if they previously served with him or were in a position of power.   </TEXT>

When I used to do interviews as late as 2012 for my employer it became a bidding/benefits war to get the top talent... Now we often have many very high quality candidates to choose from that have been looking for work for months, usually after jumping ship from startups.

Even though those 100k IBM employees being let go surely aren't all engineers, it's gotta have some impact on that already changing market. It's going to be interesting times for sure... </TEXT>

Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the threat of Russian advancement and land grabs is a major threat to members, especially when it's done in a way that's so hard to prove (with Russia claiming the Russians there are "volunteers").

NATO should begin providing Ukraine with better defense and anti-tank equipment and if necessary more offensive weapons too. Russia is not going to wave the flag of surrender, so the best thing to do is forcefully halt the advance and deal with the consequences of previous incursions and land exchanges. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. That's a ridiculously large amount of grain. It must be at a major port? We took in about 40 loads daily during the Summer with the average load coming out to around 700 bushels per truck (our trucks weren't semi's, but they were still fairly large). That comes out to 28,000 bushels per day. Let's say we had 60 days of loads coming in at that rate, though it was actually over a longer period due to different source regions and grain coming out of other neighbor's storage. That puts us at 1,680,000 bushels of incoming loads per summer.

According to Google the average weight per bushel of wheat is 60lbs, which gives us a grand total estimate of 100,800,000 lbs coming into the elevator (and also eventually leaving it) for a total of ~50,000 tons per year. That's a drop in the bucket compared to what your elevator has coming in. 

With the physics of heat and aging aside, one year at your elevator is equal to 60 years in ours. Which means we shouldn't have to worry about replacing out chutes until... oh... about the year 2240 =)

My family has a grain elevator that has functioned with very high traffic every summer/fall, and spring. During the summer when everyone is harvesting, it's in constant use (neighbors use it too) from about 7AM to 11PM. 

It was built in the 40s, and I've never seen anything like the damage to your chute, especially after 5-10 years. Our chutes and pipes are shined up for sure, but structurally sound. Where was your chute located? At the end of a **very** large and high angled drop perhaps? </TEXT>

Bandwidth still has a ways to go, but I could foresee it being doable at a commercial scale in the near future. Latency is an entirely different beast, and will require radical shifts from current consumer SSD tech.

Another factor is wear. RAM is nearly constantly shifted, written, and re-written. RAM doesn't degrade to any significant level with writes, whereas current flash memory used in SSDs does. So drive life is also holding today's SSDs back from threatening RAM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oil consumption is beginning to slow down across the world, yet more advanced/complex extraction methods are making more oil reserves available for refining/production. Most oil producing countries are still using older extraction methods, so if they shift to methods like fracking they can get even bigger 'slices of the pie'.

The US is also now the largest oil producer as well as one of the largest consumers. The US is extremely stable, so there is less likelihood of major shortages due to political/military events. This smooths the volatility of the developed world's oil supply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a long term investment I'd suggest putting funds into BP or Chevron stocks. They normally rise and fall with consumer demand and prices, and in the long term such low oil prices cannot last forever... There is bound to be a disturbance, or eventual supply shortage that causes prices to rise.

Additionally these companies are also working on alternative energy investments, so if the price of oil stays low for a long time they will likely boost their R D and alternative energy production and the stocks may increase inversely with oil prices down the road.

I'm waiting until oil gets towards $30, then I'm going to dump a lot of money into these stocks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh for sure. It wasn't meant to be a blanket statement.

But that link you provided is about how Russia refused to share space technology with China's space program? That seems to provide further evidence of how many states are well aware and afraid of China's strong tendency to steal engineering plans for their own production. China is smart, and it's a great way for them to advance. But it certainly makes potential state partners very wary of working with the Chinese on anything cutting edge.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a bit different though right? In the case of Russian spacecraft the US government was paying the Russian's for launch services, or the engines were being purchased directly from Russia. China in many cases will simply copy foreign tech after obtaining details specifications and engineering details via espionage, which is much less civil in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! This was very to the point and now I'm definitely leaning towards 20% down over paying in cash.

Interestingly a few people have PMed me too with some other things swaying my decision. Mainly that if I use most of my funds in buying a house, I lose a lot of liquidity and may have to sell the house and pay rent again anyway if something unexpected sidelines me from earning an income through the workforce for a couple of years. Whereas if I have a mortgage, I still am sitting on considerable investments that could be partially cashed to weather unforeseen emergencies.

Thank you again! And to the others who offered advice =) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over the last few years my returns on investments have averaged out to around 20%, but the market is still rebounding from the 2008 recession so I don't expect I'll see such high returns in the coming years. Historically it seems the stock market has been averaging a 6-7% yearly return, so that is what I'm anticipating for the future.

My expected interest for the mortgage is currently around 5% (I have 1 percentage point added on due to having no credit history).

The purpose for buying the house is simply as a place to live and unwind. A place I can call my own, instead of being at the mercy of a landlord. I am not buying the house itself for investment purposes. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I have investments (mostly stocks) worth ~$300k and want to buy a ~$500k house... Should I wait several years and pay for a house in full to avoid any debt/mortgage, or does it make more financial sense to buy it now with a 20% down payment and leave the remaining money in my investments? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I really like the idea of not having any monthly housing costs outside of taxes/insurance/maintenance by buying a house in full. Right now I'm paying $2,300 per month in rent, so having that extra $25,000+ in my bank account each year by buying in full would be significant. However after looking at 'interest tables' for my current investments and average historical market returns I see that over time the compounding interest on those investments can lead to values **significantly** greater than the cost of a mortgage on a $500k house over 30 years.

I'm 28 yrs old and I've never been in debt. Previously I thought buying everything in full was the best approach. Now I'm not so sure. An advice would be very much appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a dinner just like all the others, except this time it was filled with an aurora of hatred only known to one of the participants. Wally stared across the table at Clint, hoping for some flickering indication of regret of humanity. Wally and Clint had been meeting at this diner for the last 10 years. Best friends since grade school they enjoyed each others company even in silence But that was before Before Wally found out Clint was sleeping with Wallys wife, Bonnie. That was before.

Wally had spent the previous night restless, pacing back and forth contemplating his next move. Occasionally he would glance up at the shotgun hanging on the wall. A shotgun handed down to him through several generations of his family. There it hung, so peaceful, so tranquil. He grabbed it off the wall and went out on the porch. He made up his mind, his beautiful wife was everything, and Clint had taken her from him, so he was going to take Clints breath with the shotgun that lay on his lap. 
But then as Wally sat there, the sun began to rise, casting shades of orange hues across the crisp morning sky. This is beautiful. Clint said to himself. Thinking perhaps there was more beauty in the world to behold Wally walked back into his living room, and hung the shotgun back above the mantle. 

Back at the dinner, Wally wondered if he had made the right decision in sparing Clints life, in carrying on as though nothing had ever happened. He only wished there was some indication of regret on the part of Clint for his betrayal, yet he saw none. So deep within his own thoughts, Wally barely noticed at first the fly that landed upon the table beside his soup. But then it became his focus. This creature, so small, yet so intricate without any worries in the world... 

Look out Clint exclaimed as he eyed the fly and reached for a newspaper resting on the table. No, Wally calmly said as Clint raised the newspaper above the fly. Dont do it. Why, its only a fly? Clint asked. No replied Wally. Its beautiful.  The newspaper smacked down hard against the table. Other diners turned to see what the commotion was about. Then they saw the dead fly and returned to their own lives.

Wally finished his dinner with Clint, without another word spoken. As usual he paid his portion of the bill, and then Wally sauntered out of the diner and drove back to his house. He sat a moment in his idling car, and watched the wind blow across the tall autumn grass. He turned the ignition off, opened his door, and walked into his living room, and lifted the shotgun off the wall...

<TEXT> I can definitely vouch for the black area in central Washington state. There is a town there called Othello that is basically like Mexico. I stopped there this year while travelling and went to a Burger King, and none of the people inside working knew English and everyone was speaking Spanish. I tried to order something in English and got a confused look, and then told them the number I was trying to order and they still didn't understand. That's when a lady nearby stepped in and told them in Spanish, and then they figured it out... It amazes me that a franchise like Burger King doesn't require customer facing workers know English.

After that little bizarre event I drove around town out of curiosity and a lot of the signs were in Spanish as well, and I didn't see a single non-hispanic white outside of the gas station. It was like I was in the twilight zone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sample size is incredibly small for this study (20 people) so I'd take it with a grain of salt. The other thing I wonder about is whether the researchers provided a work space to the participants (ie: a job specific to the study), or whether the participants were monitored in their real-world work environment. If it's the latter, the study might be polluted by the work hierarchy. In my office building for example, I can tell you the successful people are more likely to have window offices and be less stressed because they generally aren't doing the frustrating "low level work". The lower level workers are more likely to have window-less offices and be more stressed... so I have a feeling if you moved those workers into similar workspaces, you'd still have distinct groups when it came to cortisol/stress levels, regardless of whether they had windows.

**Edit:** I'm not questioning the well known relation between sunlight and mood... Only the methods used in this study and their concluded level of impact. </TEXT>

Additionally Saudi Arabia's recent decision to not cut output goes against its previous behavior in similar conditions. Some people may say Japan's sinking economy could be a factor, but I feel that China's growing economy and oil usage should easily counter that...

<TEXT> Interesting fact: When the government came up with the Navy Seal teams they gave them names like "Navy Seal Team Six" even though there were not six teams. This was to throw off enemies to make them assume more teams were available. The base location for the team was "leaked" out during the Cold War. The location leaked was Thompson Falls, Montana.

So basically a non-existent city which is a side effect of the cold war is still in feigned existence today. It's pretty cool actually. It'd be even cooler to know why they continue to cover it up though.

**Edit:** Removing the article link as requested by the mods. Apparently people were getting malware warnings. My apologies!  </TEXT>

**10:48PM:** Windows at Wells Fargo Bank have been broken

**11:02 PM:** I-5 has now been re-opened and traffic is flowing freely. Fireworks being thrown at police elsewhere in Seattle

**11:10 PM:** Protests igniting in Capital Hill. All available cops are being asked to assist in riot gear.

**12:10 AM:** Things seem to be dying down in terms of spread. Some protesters have spray painted businesses along Pine.

**Update at 12:35 AM:** Protests have really died down. Only about 60 protesters left. </TEXT>

When I've been looking (but have not bought any yet) I'm using Craigslist to find how much rents are in an area, and then using sites like Zillow to find the areas where the difference between mortgages and rents are the most extreme, but still affordable to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the same type of situation. I'm 28 and pulling in about 100k after taxes each year. But I also feel like I am being paid for my life, as outside of work I don't really do anything. I'm almost 100% work focused, and I don't want to live this way for the rest of my life.

I've been aggressively saving/investing for a house, but around here a decent house close to work costs about $700k. My plan is to pay much of it off in a down payment, and then have a minimal mortgage, that way I have bigger incoming cash flow that I feel I can spend on 'fun purchases'. That however, is still not **wealth**. 

Luckily I work with many many others my age that make similar amounts of money or more from their day job. It allows me to get a lot of comparisons into what works wealth-wise, and what does not. At this point I'm convinced that one of the best ways to generate wealth outside of owning a business is to own property and rent it out. 

I have a friend the same age as me that currently owns 3 properties in the suburbs and rents them out. From those he's paying about $3,000 in mortgages each month, but getting about $6,000 in rent. Excluding repairs and maintenance, that's an **extra** cash flow that nets him $3,000 each month in addition to his regular work pay. To me that is wealth... Because if he were to quit his job he'd still have income to live on while he searches for another job. PLUS like me he's 28, so I would not be surprised if he continues to add another property every 2-3 years. That's wealth generating income that can increase relatively fast, and it's also a real world example of someone our age gaining wealth so he will not have to work into his 50s.

So my advice would be to look into owning property in an affordable area and renting it out, as I know it is a wealth generating method proven to work by one of my friends with similar income. </TEXT>

My agent told me the reason agents are pushing against pre-offer inspections is because the market here is so competitive a lot of buyers were getting upset when they'd pay for inspections and not have their offers accepted post-inspection.

 "The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants"

Since then there has been a larger flood of illegals that can be considered 'dependents', so I believe it would be an even greater difference today.

<TEXT> It's not direct harm. But it is indirect harm as services are used for free that those legally here help pay for. It hits hospitals especially hard, and others are forced to pay more because of it. It's well documented and understood, and it's not fair to those who obey the laws. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is an article somewhere online written by a hostage that was set free by ISIS. He was sold by the FSA (which is considered 'moderate' by the US) to ISIS. Later on he was held by a mix of ISIS and FSA fighters, and some of the FSA fighters told him they received training from the US military, and that they simply lied when they said they would not work with ISIS.

I truly believe the best thing to do at this point is support Assad in limited fashion, and setup ways to hold his soldiers accountable if any atrocities are committed after that partnership begins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say don't do this. I work at a company where quite a few of my coworkers are timid/shy, and a couple of them have stared at my eyebrows before during conversation. It will make me seem more intimidating, because it makes me annoyed. Nothing is more annoying then talking to someone who is staring above my eyes, because it makes me self-conscious of whether I have a mark on my face or something.

My brother and I actually did this when we were younger to ANNOY each other. If you have a brother/close friend, try it. Hold a conversation with them but only look at their eyebrows. They will become very uncomfortable and/or angry. I guarantee it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People that buy the "high end" expensive RAM for game usage are really better off throwing their money elsewhere. For most applications such as gaming, memory is never the bottleneck.

The only place it really counts, and even there not too noticeably, is with enterprise/businesses/researchers/enthusiasts that are running in-memory DBs.  

Personally I would recommend always going with 1600Mhz or less for DDR3. Anything more is a waste of money for most consumers. </TEXT>

She was already romantically interested in me prior to that, though I was not interested in a serious relationship and she understood that and said she was fine with it. She said she just wanted to have a fun and carefree relationship after getting burned in previous relationships. But because of the way she abruptly broke off contact I think she was just out to use me. I would not consider her a bad person in the slightest, I'm just using her as an example of why it would be hard to get anyone to just 'gift' money, even if there is already some attachment.

Nearly everyone rides in a car or bus everyday, and almost everyone has a good outcome percentage wise.

It comes down to how no business wants to be the first to reduce hours without cutting pay. Unless you are an absolute market leader, making such an action will only allow competition to get ahead, while the business costs remain the same for you. </TEXT>

Not because goods in those countries would be disrupted, but rather because it sends a huge negative signal to markets that things will be getting worse. By keeping travel open it falsely conveys the sense that everything is under control.

If the US government were to announce such a travel ban, I would begin selling and taking profits on more of my investments in stocks. The economy looks to already be teetering on a precarious edge that few officials are willing to admit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really no. There is a lot of custom hardware in name-brand laptops, and you would be unable to shrink/slim down a laptop chassis to comparable common consumer models without going through extensive design and research.

A giant bulky one that probably doesn't have much visual appeal or comfortable 'laptop' functionality is doable though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is pretty damn scary considering that the patient the health worker treated was the first person to come down with Ebola symptoms while in the US. They were extremely well prepared for that patient, they were extremely careful, and they put vast resources into keeping it from spreading. Yet it still spreads.

I'm fearful of what will happen when enough cases start popping up that such resources cannot be dedicated to single cases. I hope to god they find a significant/fixable flaw with their previous treatment and containment procedure... Because if they don't, it's very bad news for what the future might hold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is certainly scary. Though I think it's partially because it brings thoughts of huge pandemics such as those caused by the Spanish Flu, the plague, etc etc.

Even the regular flu which is often brought up as a huge worldwide killer, isn't *that bad* in terms of some of the other pandemics the world has been facing. For example, AIDs is estimated to **kill 4000+ people per day** and the HIV pandemic is still spreading, yet I think the overall 'panic' is absent from the media. 

The world is a scary place. </TEXT>

I dropped out of school when I was 16. Got hired at 21 for a 6 figure job doing software development. I've been there 8 years now and it's been very good to me. The only thing I regret about not taking school seriously and dropping out, is that I missed out on a lot of social experiences like college shenanigans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would take a very very large surface area to significantly impact the precipitation in the region, and I am unaware of any projects that have created such rainfall after filling a dry basin.

It is well understood that the benefits of pumping large volumes to extremely dry regions are immense. Wildlife returns/appears, tourism can thrive, fishing may become economical, and water becomes available for agriculture. The concern however is the rise in salinity which can 'poison' existing water tables containing freshwater.

There is a massive project underway to pump water into the diminishing Red Sea, and you may find it interesting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea%E2%80%93Dead_Sea_Canal </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is so backwards. As we create better technology to close the gaps caused by telecommuting there should be an increase in remote workers rather than a push to get rid of them.

It's happening all over. I believe it was Yahoo that recently recalled all its remote workers, and I'm also seeing it in other large tech companies with net initiatives to have everyone on site.

Currently I have a job that allows me to work remotely a couple of weeks each month, and I'm much happier because of it. I would also say I tend to be more productive when i am remote. I understand some workers may not be as productive remote versus/onsite, but if that's the case these companies should just eliminate those specific workers, rather than changing overall policy and hurting those to whom it is deeply beneficial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the simplest and incremental backup system will take up the space of the base file, plus the size of each of the incremental changes, along with a small overhead for indexing/tracking the changes. Typically the incremental backup software will store previous incremental changes with compression, to further reduce space (but increase restoration time). 

With files that change infrequently or only have minor changes incremental backups will be a very wise use of space. I would definitely advise against it for files that change extensively and often however, because the amount of space you require will skyrocket. Additionally incremental backups will not be very efficient storage-wise if you are using them regularly against compressed media files that change. For example, you may be better off with full backups if you are altering and re-encoding mp4s, as most of the file content will change and the added incremental backup overhead will not be worth the benefits. </TEXT>

But as time has gone on the documents are getting to the point where they are only hurting US citizen interests. Even ISIS is using his documents to help evade detection, because he released documents that had information about monitoring protocols in theaters of war... He should have stopped while he was ahead a long time ago.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christian militias going around attacking Muslims in the Central African Republic isn't right, but I'm not sure that's a fair comparison. Those militias were established after many constant and brutal attacks from Muslims on Christian villages. The villagers finally had enough and realized there was no safe escape, so they began to form militias to attack the Muslim attackers. In the process those militias began driving out all Muslims to avoid future attacks. The point being they are not doing it because they believe their religion says they should... They are doing it because they are/were under attack by Muslims who were trying to violently push their religion.

<TEXT> Easily renewable at the moment. But people don't seem to realize how big of a problem logging will be for us in the relatively near term future. 'Typical' logging land not receiving new sediment from river sources has been shown to be able to last ~1000 years with heavy logging before nutrients are depleted. 1000 years is a long time, but in areas in China much land has been depleted of key minerals/nutrients and can no longer sustain logging... Eventually that'll start occurring around the world, and we'll be forced to fertilize logging zones. Something that won't be very easy. </TEXT>

If they have JUST put in carpeting, ask the previous owners why they put it in. Also walk around and feel for uneven spots. I've been to two places with brand new carpeting, and with both of them it was a sneaky way of hiding uneven spots in the floor.

And it's not really a question, but more of a tip. Watch for trees that are too close to the house. For one they can damage the foundation (your inspector will let you know if any damage has already occurred) and secondly they can make it an absolute bitch to clean your roof + gutters.

Plus a no brainer: Ask how old the roof is, and how long it is rated for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's very different than MS in both symptoms, severity of symptoms, and progression rate as well as pathology. MS is thought to be caused by myelin sheath degradation/destruction, whereas ALS is caused by motor neuron death. 

To put it into computer-like perspective based on current pathology suspects: MS is like having a network cable between two computers that is damaged/being damaged, so sometimes messages between the two behave incorrectly... If you repair the cable you can alleviate the symptoms (in MS your body will try to repair myelin as well), as the source and recipients are just fine. ALS is like the network card going bad... eventually messages will not be able to be sent or received, and the progression to failure is usually much faster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's truly incredible how common rare diseases really are across the population. I have a neurological/autoimmune illness and while the specialists know what antibodies I have, and what the symptoms are, very little is actually understood about the illness... to the point where it doesn't even have a name. 

Prior to the antibody find I was told I may have the following ALS (first), Stiff Person Syndrome (two months later), Neuromytonia (three months later), Parkinsons or Multi System Atrophy (six months later). Then when they found the antibody they told me it was none of these previous suspects. The only real treatments currently known are suppression of the immune system or plasma exchange (both treatments I have been lucky enough to avoid)... And those are basically some of the most generic treatments out there. All of this both scares me and excites me when it comes to our understanding of neurological illnesses... It scares me because often diagnoses are often just educated guesses and change frequently with the symptoms, and because the underlying pathology of many of these illnesses is unknown. But it greatly excites me also, because I can see we are in the infancy of understanding, and that means incredible advances lay before us! </TEXT>

Unfortunately ALS typically robs the sufferers of life within a very short period of time... Rarely is survival greater than a few years. It's a very very scary disease. 

Luckily there are some companies working on some promising treatments (check out Brainstorm's clinical trials). Currently there is only one treatment available, and it only extends function for weeks or a few months. Breakthroughs can't come soon enough. </TEXT>

They seem hellbent on getting some violent clashes to take place, probably because they foolishly find it to be adventurous and fun. If they haven't stopped yet, they probably won't stop for the National Guard. It's going to be very interesting, because in many previous historical instances where the National Guard is called in to stop riots, they end up shooting and killing multiple rioters... and that was before social media. Now with Twitter, Facebook, and all the other social media so easily accessible, I could foresee this turning into long term 'insurgency' of sorts, with race being the underlying factor in who is being attacked and who is attacking. </TEXT>

Recently I've started to realize just how brutal and barbaric the Nazi's were... I mean I knew they were brutal, and did terrible terrible things, but again it felt so distant. But now I see videos from Iraq of civilians being tortured and killed in mass by the 'Islamic State'... The Islamic State members say they are determined to wipe out entire races/religions and are clearly moving forth in that plan. I can imagine how terrifying it must be to be one of those targeted civilians in Iraq... and then it begins to dawn on me just how terrifying it would have been in Nazi Germany, because unlike Iraq, in Germany it was an entire nation wanting to kill you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been programming since I was a teenager, and started out being extremely productive while living with my parents before I transitioned into an adult. At 20 I was hired by a well known and prestigious software company and shipped out from a farm in a rural part of the US to the big city... 

The first few years I was insanely productive pretty much anywhere I worked, at home, at the office, or even at a hotel. But over time I began to lose that motivation, that urge for productivity. I found myself easily distracted, and instead of being excited for the work ahead I merely wished to procrastinate through unnecessary and irrelevant actions. I was burned out.

Several more years have passed. I have a remote work arrangement, so I rented an office that I can work out of that rural part of the US again for 2 weeks a month, while I spend the rest at the company headquarters. One thing that I've begun to realize is that "where" you work is less important than "why" you work. If you find yourself heading to your office and you ask yourself whether you'd rather be doing something else, then the location of that office is mostly irrelevant, because you will likely not be productive.

For me my most productive, and thoughtful times have come after or during socialization. If you are isolating yourself, I think the first step is to try to socialize a bit. Talk to and hang out with friends, spend a few hours just hanging out with the family... If you are like me that will give you a sense of calmness and belonging, and you'll find that you actually want to code and be productive, because your mind feels relaxed.

<TEXT> This is bad news for the world. The Russians show no true effort to deescalate the situation, and instead continue to arm and train those perceived to be fighting against Western interests. Meanwhile Western countries are showing no deescalation in their support, training, and potential arming of fighters of Eastern/Russian interests. 

Think about, nobody is going to back down. Things have been getting progressively worse since the Georgia war. Every year more players become involved, and with every passing moment the fighting and hatred seems to intensify across Northern Africa, the Middle East, and Western Europe... If any side backed down they would look weak, and are also more vulnerable to violent actions from those that oppose them.

I truly fear this will continue to spiral out of control until world wide war breaks out within the next few years that is split between influence from the West, The East, and the Far East. It's not showing signs of slowing down, and really, how can it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not specific luxury goods or services per say, but I've noticed the following perks related to services... and I'm not really super wealthy, though my path is destined for that through my career (currently in my 20s with a respectable 6 figure salary, and loads of savings and investments). 

* **Better banking and financial service**. My bank put me into their highest/top-level investment tier and also gave me concierge services, along with customer service most people would dream of...

*  **Discounts at well known hotels, retailers and resorts**. These guys know you have money, and once they get a taste they want to bring you back for more. They want you to bring your wealthy friends back with you too. It may seem counter-intuitive, but they often do this by offering wealthy customers big discounts.

* **More respect across many professional services**. There have been a lot of cases where I'm meeting with someone from a company offering professional services (real estate agencies, insurance companies, auto companies, etc) and they change their behavior from 'standard' treatment to 'excellent' treatment when they find out I'm a wealthy potential or existing client. The things they do to fuck over the normal customers don't really happen to me, because I'm such a 'valued customer'. Escalation is also very simple... If they can't get something done at a local branch (like reversing fees, upgrading service, etc) they'll call their manager and make it a point to mention where I work and what I do (not a lawyer!), and things will get resolved quickly. I've also noticed increased respect from law enforcement. I've gotten out of many tickets simply because the officer wanted to talk about my work and my lifestyle, and also mention their dreams regarding investments etc. If I wasn't wealthy, those discussions wouldn't happen, and I'd likely get a ticket.

* **Better/faster seating at lounges and restaurants**. This doesn't happen too often, but I'm inclined to believe it's simply because there aren't many situations where a waitress/seating manager will learn about my wealth and career. But when such situations do occur such as when they are making small talk and asking what I do for a living, I'll notice a change in the service for the better. They'll start actively 'looking around' for seating, or allow me to sit in their special seating areas. I don't think that would happen if I wasn't wealthy... but I could be wrong.

* **People that will do everything for you**. Not one person covering all aspects by themselves, but rather multiple people that have their own specialties. These are not 'unknown' to most people, but I feel as though they are considered unobtainable to many... I'm talking about having gardeners, maid services, personal trainers, personal finance managers, shopping assistants, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you ever become very wealthy in relation to the average working man/woman in your country you'll likely see it first hand as the person on the receiving end of those requests... I'm not super rich by and means, but I'm in my 20s with a 6 figure salary and lots of savings. After news spread amongst friends, old 'friends' and 'distant relatives' began to come out of the shadows. They'd tell me their sob stories about how they needed to make car payments, rent, etc... But in what seemed like 99% of the cases it was the people who felt I owed them just because they asked for it. It's really irritating to have people get angry when you tell them no... It's like they assume money falls into your lap without hard work.

I help friends out with small things, but only if they don't ask. The last time someone asked and I gave them cash, it cost me $5000, and more importantly it cost me a normal friendship. Once people get some money they seem to think they are entitled to more, and so do their friends... It makes things so uncomfortable to me that I've had to inactivate my Facebook at times just because so many people are hinting or blatantly asking for money. 

It has also made me realize that dating will never be normal for me. The moment a girl finds out you're loaded their behavior completely changes and they'll be trying desperately to get your attention, I have yet to see a case where this isn't true. I'm male and young, so it's a great perk, but I still worry about what I may be losing because of it...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a lot of savings and investments and belong to an investment group  of semi-large transaction traders (with a $250,000 asset minimum). Stocks  were off to a very rocky start earlier this year, but have really become a shining light lately. However the general consensus is that it will not last much longer, and upcoming world events may be a strong factor in a general market drop.

I personally believe this is why the House just announced it will be suing the President. Everyone knows what is coming, and people are trying to shift any blame before the house of cards begins to fall.

What is bizarre to me is why there is not a noticeable drop or leveling in the stock markets. Big investors are moving a lot of money out of the stock markets and putting it into tangible assets such as real estate, myself included. In the Seattle area you can actually see when this started to happen by looking at housing supply. The new money maker is rent and property management, but because of so many assets being moved to real estate we're actually creating a bubble in the process.

My suggestion to those without real estate investments is to ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or other tangible assets. It's wise even when the economy is doing well, but common sense when the economy is beginning to falter.

Idaho based militias would attack targets in California, retreat to the mountainous Idaho terrain, and then trigger a war in the region that would end up pulling in Montana and the Dakotas on the side of Idaho.

Good old fashioned guerrilla warfare bitches! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehaawwwww. http://imgur.com/sq1S8  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To the people saying the graphics/performance won't get better over time because the hardware 'sucks' and because it is already well-known architecture... you should know things aren't so black and white. The x86-64bit processor architecture presents some problems which are being carried over from those who are accustom to developing games for PCs. When developing for PCs you obviously do not know what specific hardware the customers will be running, so you can't really optimize for a specific set of hardware. This is not the case for PS4/XBox One. Over time we will see more and more 'tricks' that will introduce better performance on that specific hardware, but learning those tricks takes time and experience... and it's still early in this generation of consoles.

The second thing is that game engines are of course not perfect. Over iterations they will continually improve (if done right) in terms of efficiency and capability. The Unreal Engine and ID Tech engines are prime examples of this. As this generation of console matures, there will be a natural improvement of the Engines that are at the core of many of the games.... the quality will not remain static just because the hardware is static.

It's also important to remember that drivers can be a huge culprit when it comes to poor performance, and they too will continue to evolve on the consoles to result in better performance.

The graphics/performance of the games is destined to improve over time.

<TEXT> It really depends on the market. If it's a hot market with a low supply of homes it's very unlikely that you'll have your offer accepted if it is below the list price and the home is in good condition. 

In my city for example, the homes in the neighborhoods I've been looking at have all been selling around 6% ABOVE list price.

I'd suggest looking around the neighborhood at other recent sales using Zillow, and try to get an idea of how final sale prices are comparing to original list prices. Putting in an offer lower than list price is risky in many markets... It's also common for some people to put an initial offer slightly above market price, just so their offer is accepted over others without a bidding war. If that happens, your offer will likely be thrown out immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't consider the effort it took me to get the money which I invest, the easiest money I have made was without a doubt through the stock market. There are many stocks I sit on for long-term gains, but there are also occasionally some stocks I buy/sell with my personal account for short-term gains. In 2013 I bought $100k of a stock in the morning, and sold it near the market close for a profit of $5000. It was a few clicks, and some pretty passive monitoring... but it netted me enough for a couple months of rent. The total fee excluding taxes was $19. That was pretty damn easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, the title is a bit misleading, as the behaviors returned after the drug wore off...

Secondly, as someone with Aspergers, this is both exciting and terrifying to me. I really hate the social aspects of Aspergers. I'm not good with any form of communication unless there is some sort of directive or goal. Correcting this would be very welcomed. The part that scares me is I wonder what else I might lose... I work in software engineering, and I feel like my autistic-traits give me a huge advantage when it comes to designing complex interacting systems. If I lose the ability to visualize such systems with clarity and focus, treatment becomes a cost to benefit analysis to me... and I'm not sure which outcome would be the most beneficial to me.

Still, this research intrigues me. Any understanding towards potentially correcting flaws is a great step towards the future of health and science. </TEXT>
