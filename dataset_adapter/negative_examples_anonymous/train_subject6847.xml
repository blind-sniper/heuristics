<TEXT> His defense attorneys had never tried a criminal jury case "I did not question the unfairness of Mr. Ford having appointed counsel who had never tried a criminal jury case much less a capital one. It never concerned me that the defense had insufficient funds to hire experts or that defense counsel shut down their firms for substantial periods of time to prepare for trial. These attorneys tried their very best, but they were in the wrong arena. They were excellent attorneys with experience in civil matters. But this did not prepare them for trying to save the life of Mr. Ford." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have never practiced in Missouri so I can't speak to everything that happened in that case. But I do have the added benefit of being able to review [the minutes and evidence](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/25/us/evidence-released-in-michael-brown-case.html) because it was released publicly. From the minutes and evidence I think the Grand Jury in Darren Wilson's case made the wrong decision but it was not as clear cut as the case here appears to be. There were conflicting eye witness testimony and forensic reports. Here, there is a pretty clear cut video of the incident.

The problem I have with the Darren Wilson case is that he was given special treatment. I do not know Missouri law on whether a defendant can testify in front of the Grand Jury so I'll refrain from commenting on that aspect. The prosecution treated him with kid gloves which normally does not happen. They did not really challenge his story or ask for significant clarification about his description of events that seemed unlikely or contradicted witness testimony. Other defendants would never be so lucky. The prosecution conducted a mini trial in the Grand Jury by presenting pro-defense evidence, witnesses, and theories. As a criminal defense attorney I fully support doing so and it is something we always complain about prosecutors not doing. The problem arises here because they never do that for any other defendants. I also highly doubt that any other non-cop, non-politician defendant that comes after Officer Wilson will be given the same treatment. The prosecution knew exactly what they were doing. They gave Darren Wilson special treatment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was not in the Grand Jury nor am I privy to the information that was presented to it in this case. But in my opinion, based on my experience and the experiences of my colleagues, it is extremely rare that a grand jury chooses not to indict with this type of evidence. An indictment is a very low threshold and for the most part the expression "the grand jury would indict a ham sandwich, if that's what you wanted" is true. Unless and until the minutes are released I can only speculate to why this Grand Jury differed from the norm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a criminal defense attorney that practices in NY and I have significant experience with grand jury issues. A defendant has a right to testify in the grand jury and all that is needed to preserve that right is to serve on the prosecution a notice of the intention to exercise that right. This notice is under [C.P.L. 190.50](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/CPL/TWO/I/190/190.50) but is more commonly referred to as cross-Grand Jury notice. 

You are correct that the prosecution can indict someone without telling the person they are about to be indicted but this is true under only certain circumstances and is quite rare. Typically, you are arrested and arraigned by a judge on the felony charges which immediately indicates that the prosecution can indict your client. The prosecution then serves their notice right then of their intention to indict. The defense attorney then has the option of serving cross-Grand Jury notice. If cross-Grand Jury notice is in effect and the prosecution indicts without allowing the defendant to testify the indictment would later be dismissed (with some exceptions). Now if they do not arrest the defendant but the defendant becomes aware of the Grand Jury possibly indicting him he can still serve notice that he wishes to testify and it must be upheld. The only time a defendant generally does not know is when it is a "silent indictment" meaning the prosecution indicts prior to the defendant's arrest. Those situations are generally reserved for charges stemming from long term investigations into organized crime and large drug conspiracies.

Although I cannot say absolutely what happened here I can make a pretty informed educated guess. The officer knew the prosecution was presenting his case to the grand jury because it was public knowledge and reported in the media. As a result he had his attorney serve the cross-Grand Jury notice which means the prosecution must let him testify. I have many problems with what happened here but the defendant being allowed to testify is not one of them. His ability to testify presents no reason to believe there is anything suspect. There may be many other factors that do cause suspicion though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am more than aware what a felony does to someone's life; I am a criminal defense attorney. You are still incorrect about what is happening here. The current policy is not to charge you with a felony. It was to charge you with a misdemeanor or a violation unless you had felony weight. In fact, in NY, sale of less than 25 grams of marijuana is only a misdemeanor (N.Y. Penal Law 221.40). There is no change in the severity of the crime being charged here. It will still be a misdemeanor or a violation (depending on the circumstances). It is a misdemeanor for possession in public view, burning marijuana in public, or possession of more than 25 grams but less than 8 ounces. It is a violation solely for non-public view possession of less than 25 grams. That has been the law for decades.

This summons will not being like a parking ticket. The only difference from the previous policy will be that instead of being arrested and either being given a DAT after a few hours at the precinct or being brought through arraignments hours later (risking bail being set) you will be given a summons telling you what date and what time to come to court. If you have an active warrant you will still be arrested as usual. I will admit that summons traditionally are seen as less serious as non-summons but that doesn't change the level of the crime charged. The other problem is that since summonses were rarely ever used for this charge it will be interesting to see if prosecutors start taking summonses more seriously.

I would be happy to answer questions about this stuff or expand on anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You were able to get a DAT but they were not required to give you one. It was left to the discretion of the officer. They made a big push to change that but it was not 100% successful. Judging from your screen name I am guessing you are an officer. So you are aware the DAT data sheet had more check boxes than just active warrants. Anyone with an active warrant gets arrested, regardless of the severity of the charge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This depends. If you know for an absolute fact that your client is going to lie on the stand you have an obligation to explain to him the possible consequences of doing so and try to convince him out of testifying. Since your client has an absolute right to testify if he still chooses to do so you can ask to be removed from the case for a conflict of interest (irreconcilable differences about the defense). 

If you cannot be removed from the case for that reason (ex. some public defenders or too far along the process) or your request for removal would make it obvious your client is going to lie under oath, you let your client testify and tell his story without eliciting any information. In other words, your client just tells his story in a narrative form instead of you getting it piece by piece by direct questions. This prevents you from suborning perjury.

It is quite rare though that you know for an absolute fact that your client's testimony is a lie or will be a lie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Under New York state law choosing the wrong apartment is not protected. If the screams were fabricated and the 911 call was for a different apartment than they had no reason to enter, the defendant had a constitutional right to slam the doors in their faces, and anything observed or recovered or statements made after they violated that constitutional right would be suppressed. A short Daily News article is far from reporting all the claims any side is making. I guarantee the arraignment alone had more facts than this article.

It is also not clear if the 911 call was for that apartment. From the defense attorney's comments it appears the defense's claim is that the police went to the wrong apartment, dragged the woman out without reason or cause, and then created their story later to cover up their mistakes. As of now we do not have enough facts to determine the truth.

They did nothing to the officers and did not commit any crimes. Also, I have no reason to believe the officers behaved in a reasonable way to begin with. First, it appears that are willing to lie about the situation considering that ACS concluded that there were no injuries to the 12 year old as the police claimed. Second, based upon my own experiences in court rooms I know that under these circumstances the police are rarely courteous and/or helpful. Why should a civilian, within his or her rights, be more polite than the professionals paid to uphold the law? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the Supreme Court would disagree with you and so would much of the case law that followed after [Payton v. New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_v._New_York). In Payton the Court found that absent exigent circumstances the home cannot be entered without a warrant or without permission of the homeowner. Here, based upon the ACS statement (There were no injuries to the child as alleged in the complaint) and as of the facts now known it appears the 911 call was to a different apartment (the 911 call came from a different apartment on an upper floor  and cops went to Stewarts door by mistake). There is no mention of a warrant and there were no exigent circumstances therefore the door could be slammed in the officers' faces. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a criminal defense attorney I think this goes both ways. Whenever there is any type of forensic evidence the jurors think, because of these shows, that it is unquestionably accurate and impossible to overcome. I then have the responsibility to try to climb that mountain by poking holes in the prosecution's experts and/or providing my own experts. What ends up happening is I have to convince a bored jury, with preconceived notions, of the flaws in the methods, etc. No matter how many times a judge instructs the jury that I have no burden whenever forensic evidence is presented it is as if the burden automatically shifted. I also really hate these shows for perpetuating the myth of "legal technicalities" and for other things like if you aren't read your Miranda rights that your case is automatically dismissed. It is infuriating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I strongly disagree with you. There is a significant difference. The video is a duplication of the original. The prosecutor and police had the same ability to get a copy but did not do their due diligence. The defense attorney is not required to provide evidence to convict his client to the prosecutor. In fact, it would be malpractice to do so. Even in the murder weapon example you use the attorney would have to turn over the weapon but could not say how he came into possession of it. To not turn it over would be to hide the evidence since it is the original and only version. Here, the defense attorney never had the original, did not destroy the original, and is entitled to refuse to turn over a copy of his copy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I feel your post is insulting by inferring that I am not a good lawyer, I have decided to answer you because, besides the presentation of your questions, your questions are valid. I do not at any time during my representation of client, no matter the client, want them to get any less than the best possible outcome. If at any time that I continue to represent them and I change that outlook I cannot possibly give them the best available defense because I would have to actively work against my own personal view. How can I possibly give my defense of client all I can if at the same time I want them to be convicted? I anticipate that you will claim that this is my inability to make "mental distinctions" but I think you are kidding yourself if you think anyone can under those circumstances.

You said "This does not mean that in my capacity as a defense attorney I should let my suspicion of the client's wrongdoing lead me to botch his or her defense, but were I a lawyer, my existence could be justified only on the basis that I am firmly and fully committed to the idea that justice should prevail" I strongly believe, as do most defense attorneys that I have discussed these issues with, that justice can only prevail if I fight my hardest within the boundaries of the law regardless of the circumstances. It is the role of the jury and/or judge (depending on the case and jurisdiction) to determine guilt or innocence (not guilt). To want anyone to be convicted would distort my role and usurp their roles.

You seem to be under the impression that I do not think anyone deserves prison or to be convicted. I am well aware that some of my clients got the exact punishment they deserve but that is not something I contemplate until I no longer represent them. The only judgments I make of my client while I represent them are the ones that are necessary to provide the best defense. Examples include judging the chances of a successful trial or how he/she may appear if he/she testifies or does not testify.

I would also like to point out, as you have admitted, you are not a lawyer. You cannot fully understand what it is actually like in these situations without having the personal experience. It is easy to tell me what I should or should not do without having to do it yourself. I'd love to see you look a client in the eye, someone who you were assigned to represent, someone who does not know you, does not trust you, and the public and a giant government system have already found guilty pretrial, and tell him/her that you will do everything that is within your capacity to defend them while in the back of your head you hope the justice system convicts him/her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a criminal defense attorney. I have never wanted any of my clients to be committed no matter how guilty he/she may be and no matter how serious the crime alleged. Any attorneys that want their clients convicted should not being representing those clients. It is my job to represent my client to the best of my ability regardless of the crime alleged. Once you forget that it is time for you to retire or change practices. We are an essential part of the justice system and it is important that we uphold our clients' constitutional rights. We have incredible weights on our shoulders; the system would be an even bigger failure if we acted in any other fashion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost everything you said was correct. Yes, it would have an official court date and while it could be a summons it was more likely a DAT. It does not really matter though because it has the same effect in having you appear in court. The statute actually allows for 3 months in prison, not 90 days. That is important because it can actually be more or less than 90 days depending on what month you get sentenced. Probation would be 1 year, not 3. 3 years is for an A Misdemeanor. You were charged with a B Misdemeanor. Regardless, you were still eligible for a MACD if you had no prior record. I hope that is what you ended up with if the case was not outright dismissed. I absolutely believe it cost you $750. More importantly I agree that the marijuana laws are outdated and unnecessarily harsh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of things about this. First, you were facing up to 3 months in prison, not 6. It would be highly unlikely for you to get any prison time if you were convicted. If you had no prior convictions on your record and you were only charged with the marijuana you were eligible for a Marijuana Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal (MACD). An MACD means that if you don't get in trouble for a year your case is dismissed and sealed without any conviction or guilt. Simple possession is not a "citation" but a violation, less than a misdemeanor and not considered a criminal charge under NY law. Also, you probably received a Desk Appearance Ticket (DAT) and not a citation to appear in court. Finally, the cops illegally searched and seized you (arguably) but unfortunately we all know how hard it is to prove the truth when the officers will lie about what happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will try to clear up a lot of confusion that is present here. The article is misleading. First, the charges will be the same but until now for a misdemeanor marijuana arrest the police had the option of either holding someone until they saw a judge (sometimes that may take until the next day or two) or issuing him/her a Desk Appearance Ticket (DAT). A DAT gives you a court date that you will have to appear in the future (usually a month away) but allows you to walk out of the precinct as soon as the police are done processing you. Until now, depending on the cop, your record, and other factors you may have ended up being held or being issued a DAT. The NYPD actually fills out a form (like everything else) showing how they determined why or why not a person deserved a DAT. It is a useless form for the most part because it was still mostly subjective. 

Now, the new policy will be that any one charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession and only misdemeanor or violation marijuana possession and has no outstanding warrants they will received a DAT. You still face the same criminal charges and the same possible jail time, probation, etc. if you plead guilty or are convicted at trial. The Governor, apparently now backed by Bloomberg, is trying to have the current misdemeanor charge for marijuana changed to a violation but he has so far failed to get it past the legislature. The big difference that is not mentioned in the article is the issue of bail. As long as you show up on the correct date it is incredibly rare a judge sets bail on a DAT whereas a regular arraignment may end with bail being set depending on many factors. Being stuck in jail because a person cannot make bail is more likely to lead to that person taking a guilty plea to get released rather than fight the case. Feel free to ask me any questions. I will do my best to answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes a portable breathalyzer test is only enough to generate probable cause but the officer's observations and any statements she made or the officer testifies to her making can be enough to convict without a breathalyzer test. Especially based on this story I would not put it past the officers saying she refused the regular breathalyzer test. 

I can't speak about "the vast majority of states" but I will speak about the states I have worked in and the judge cannot throw out the charges because there is no breathalyzer result. And you can be convicted. The officer will testify to this "When we arrived on the scene she smelled of alcohol, had been in accident, slurred her speech, was belligerent, incorrectly identified the street she was on, etc." Then they will say she refused the breathalyzer test. And now you have a cop's word against her word. Very possible to get a conviction.

Probable cause is enough for an arrest. That's actually what you need to arrest someone. You may being thinking of "reasonable suspicion" to stop a car, approach her, or ask her questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It differs by each state. Some states can charge you with a presumption of DUI if you refuse to take a breathalyzer test. That leaves you with a jury being instructed that there is a presumption you were drunk that you now have to overcome. Even though I find such presumptions completely unconstitutional the Supreme Court says they are fine. </TEXT>

In other words it is not in my interest to have more cases or more clients. Not all advice from attorneys comes from their interest in being paid. Unfortunately, there are many attorneys whose advice is based upon how much money they can make. It is something that sickens me.

<TEXT> While I do understand where you are coming from I stand by my original advice. Having those charges dropped or reduced could just as easily have occurred after you receive an attorney without any chance of incriminating yourself even unknowingly. If a person is innocent then having an attorney can go a long way to showing that. The risk of saying the wrong thing even if you did not do it is too high. Like you said there are innocent people who are convicted of crimes based on speaking with the police. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Race came into play because the all white (or almost all white) privileged lacrosse team was accused of raping a poor black woman and calling her racial slurs. The DA used this to stir up racial tension in order to win the black community's vote to get reelected. He was later disbarred as a direct result of how he handled this case. Race played a major part in the case.

I personally do not think the ad went far enough to be considered defamatory under the law but it is not exactly as clear cut as you portray it. This line in particular sticks out to me: "These students are shouting and whispering about what happened to this young woman and to themselves." It clearly implies that something bad happened to her and less specifically indicating the crime committed against her. Some people were actually accused of this so to say that it happened is to say that the charges are against them are at least partially true. We now know beyond a reasonable doubt that the accusations were a complete fabrication.

The ad was also a timing issue. These professors chose to exploit this situation as if it absolutely happened. And some of them were also proven to have made statements and taken actions well beyond the ad which led many to believe that reading the ad in the most negative light was appropriate. For example, one of the professors failing two of the lacrosse students without good [cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_88#Duke_students_and_faculty). 

To say that this was not related to the lacrosse players and the rape charges is to ignore the context this ad appeared in. While again I do not think it rises to the level of defamation I absolutely believed this was aimed at the lacrosse players and ignored innocent until proven guilty. There was an assumption that the woman's story was true and it clearly was not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a criminal defense attorney. I can't even explain how infuriating it is when I get a young client because of some minor infraction that occurred in school. Often times the school safety agent acts as a judge, jury, and executioner and roughs up my client before placing him/her (mostly minority boys) under arrest. The thing this article leaves out though is the staggering number of parents who use the criminal justice system to discipline their children. There seems to be an increasing number of parents that call the police on their children for such minor things as fighting with their siblings, getting caught smoking marijuana, breaking something out of anger, etc. I acknowledge the fact that there are situations where it is necessary to get police involved even with children but the standard for that has lowered. A growing number of parents do not want to raise their children; they want someone else to do it for them. They choose the police, judges, etc. to effect discipline but are completely unaware or unsympathetic to the horrors their children face. Prison can be a scarring experience, even being stuck in jail for one night can do serious damage. Let's not forget missing school, becoming a social pariah, and getting criminal records. The list is endless. Don't blame TV, video games, etc. when your kids no longer trust you and do everything they can to avoid home. </TEXT>

Their bosses may be though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You do realize that it was a lot more than inconvenience for a few customers, right? And that this is not his first time in trouble or the first time he has been/will be sentenced to prison? And although you think justice is not intended to make examples of people that has long been accepted as a motive for sentencing people, the deterrence of others. In fact it is a factor that federal judges are required to consider in their sentencing determinations, "to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct." [18 U.S.C.  3553(a)(2)(B)](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/II/227/A/3553). I agree a life sentence is too harsh but it is also unlikely for him to get a life sentence. I also agree that this judge should recuse herself to avoid the appearance of injustice whether it would exist or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one is defending the killing of the animals and that is not protected speech. Banning the possession, sale, or distribution of such materials does not extinguish the market. For reference think about the ban on child pornography and drug prohibition. Those markets will exist regardless of their legality. And this market seems much smaller than those. 

While the death of an animal is not treated the same as a human why should the video of the death be banned? If a video of someone being tortured and killed is distributed it is not illegal regardless if the person is caught or not. Again, not to mention that many of the videos that fell into the illegal category under the law were not these horrible crush videos. If PETA was to distribute on their website videos of dog fights to encourage people to take action against such abuses than an over zealous prosecutor could have used the original law to prosecute them. The original law was too broad and the Supreme Court agreed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually it is not ridiculous. The case was decided by the Supreme Court in an [8-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Stevens) decision. The law that it invalidated did not ban the making of such videos (that is already illegal throughout the USA) but banned the possession, distribution, etc. So every single person in this thread who ever accidentally downloaded one of these videos would have been in violation of that law. The law tried to make animal cruelty videos equivalent to child pornography which it of course was not. It was an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. In the [case](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-stevens/) that was actually decided by the Supreme Court, the defendant compiled and sold dog fighting footage but took no part in the actual dog fighting. The law was so broad that videos that groups like PETA distributed could have violated it. It would seem weird to me that videos of people being killed can be legally distributed but not of animals being killed.

The law that Obama signed was designed to fix the constitutional issues and to avoid an over broad interpretation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not a problem with the disorderly conduct law; that is a problem with the police illegally applying the law. They had no cause to arrest these people nor many others that they do the same thing to. Unfortunately, the NYPD will rarely ever punish them but any citizen that does suffer this unconstitutional treatment can sue the NYPD and the city. There is also the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Internal Affairs Bureau (both of which are usually useless). I recommend suing as your best bet.

I'd like to say that I don't see abuses of power often but that would be a lie. Almost every day I am court I see some level of abuse of power. It can range from outright lying on the stand to searching someone without cause. And for the record there is no law against dancing per se. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay this is a little tough to explain. Everyone in the justice system knows that disorderly conduct is a completely bullshit law. These people's charges were dismissed and based on the info provided in the article probably by the prosecutor before they even saw the judge. Most of the time in NYC if you are charged with only disorderly conduct the charges will be dismissed or you can receive an ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal). An ACD means that if you do not get in trouble again for 6 months the charges are dismissed and sealed. 

Disorderly conduct has been challenged multiple times as unconstitutional but the courts have consistently upheld its validity. It is written in such a way that it does not violate the first amendment, according to the courts. 

As a defense attorney I am not so sure I want this statute to disappear. The reason for that is because it is only considered a violation which is not a crime under NY law. Often times when prosecutors can't or won't dismiss a bad case they will offer the disorderly conduct plea even when disorderly conduct has nothing to do with the original charges. Or sometimes they offer it even in a good case if there is a reason they feel the defendant does not deserve the punishment he or she is possibly facing. This plea allows your client to avoid a criminal record and avoid risking losing at trial. Some defense attorney are a little too willing to have their clients take these pleas but I can definitely say that there are times it is overwhelmingly beneficial for my client to take it. 

Here is some other information about it: http://newyorkcitydefense.com/disorderly-conduct-new-york.html
and http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/opinion/sunday/inside-the-warped-world-of-summons-court.html?smid=pl-share

<TEXT> I agree with you that cops are often dicks but generally for violations arrests you do not spend the night in jail but rather are given a Desk Appearance Ticket (DAT) and told to appear in court a month later. As RuleLawyer said passing drugs is considered sale in NY but marijuana is specifically excluded from the definition of a narcotic or a controlled substance. It is charged differently. Also having weed or any other drug in a baggie is not intent to sell in itself. Police can always find a way to cause people problems but this makes it more difficult for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There seems to be a lot of confusion here. As of right now if you are found with a small amount of marijuana not in public view it is only a violation. If it is in public view it is a B Misdemeanor. For those of you that think this won't effect the NYPD's policing behavior you may be right but what is important is that it will lessen the effects. For example cops often claim they saw marijuana in public view after they illegally searched someone and found it in their pockets. A common lie is that they saw it in the person's hand and then they put it in their pocket or they threw it on the ground. They also do this when they illegally search cars, the officer will say it was clearly visible in the center console. Now these lies will not benefit them because whether or not it was public view the charge will only be a violation. For those of you that do not know NY law, a violation is not a crime and is sealed from your record after 1 year. </TEXT>

And probably the worse thing that can happen is that the bar finds you lied to them on an application for admission. That being said it is very unlikely that something as minor as this, especially considering the low punishment and the rest of your circumstances, will prevent you from going to law school or practicing law. </TEXT>
