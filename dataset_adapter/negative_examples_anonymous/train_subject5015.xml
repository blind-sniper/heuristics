<TEXT> I admit I did misinterpret the article, only because I didn't actually read the tweets, maybe you can see how the article coupled with it's comments makes it seem serious. I'll take out the part in my comment about the article being serious.

On the subject of the 'comments', I wasn't talking about the tweets. It's extremely obvious to anyone that understands a laughing emoticon that they find it funny, and if I had actually read them and seen checked their names against the authors then I wouldn't have said that the article was taking it seriously.

What I was talking about: http://gyazo.com/7b8791a9050585d904fb622d1d21ada9 The very first and most liked of the article comments is about race culture and Blair's 'so called labour government.

Please dude, take a chill pill next time and scroll down the page a little more. Maybe re read someones post and the article they're talking about before calling them an idiot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Crone also said she would kill Geralt, which she didn't. Crone's were wrong about a lot of things. I doubt they thought they would all be killed by Geralt/Ciri, or that  Geralt would betray them and release the children (what I did). 

Also if you also look in the quest log for the final quest it say something to the effect of "well as for Geralt, that's another story.". Dandelion also dosen't say anything about Yen,Triss, etc (at least in my ending), he only speaks of the political situation. I don't think that's really implying anything.

I'm not saying he didn't kill himself, it's definitely possible. I just think CDPR wanted it to be open to interpretation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like a better ending than mine.

Ciri goes into a portal created by the Elven mage, crosses into another world and then walks into the White Frost, she has some flashbacks of Geralt and her (now that i think about these were all from the last 'chapter', like me giving her the necklace instead of burning down the laboratory, i assume all these event flashbacks are the ones that caused this specific ending). Then the Frost in Geralts world stops, so I assume she stopped it successfully. Don't know if she escaped it like she did in another ending or what.

After this Geralt goes to the Crone's house, kills the remaining Crone and gets Vesimirs wolf medallion. He then kneels inside the house, clutching the medallion. You see a ton of monsters approaching the house, and then it fades to black. No idea if he was sad enough to let them kill him or what. </TEXT>

In my ending, we get to know a bit about the political situation, but I can't really say I care about that that much. In terms of the characters, the *only* thing we know is that Geralt and Ciri may or may have not died. No idea what happened to any of the other characters. Was really let down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Got the ending where she sacrifices herself to stop the Frost. Can't believe I don't get to know how the other characters reacted and what happened to them....wondering if this is just a CDPR fuck up (maybe they ran out of time like suggested below?) or if there's something im missing? On the other hand, I feel like this is one of the morally 'better' endings, as Ciri is saving an entire planet.

Also, did anyone find the boss fight with Eredin/Other Wild Hunt General really really easy? Like each one of his hits only took away about 1/20th of my healthbar, and each of my Quen signs absorbed two of his hits. I'm 99% sure even the wild hunt dogs were doing more damage to me.

I was using full master ursine armor/sword, specc'd mostly into the red skill tree, at around lvl34.

I just can't imagine why they wouldn't tell us what happened to the other characters (in this and other endings). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those are all completely different games. With different engines, different amount of calculations running in the background, different gameplay goals, different core mechanics, different art styles etc etc etc. Not to mention GTA had a 265$million budget and their game still takes 5 minutes to load into multiplayer, compared to DayZ which was a free mod (initially) and is the most tense gameplay experience i've ever had.. Saying shit like that makes it sound like you have no idea what you're talking about OR like you're baiting. </TEXT>

No need to act like a smartass about it, as if you have some inside info. Even if it was a plant, why are they trying to get the video viral? There's not even a product placement and the video isn't even on the colleges youtube - even if I wanted to buy a ticket to see him I have no idea where he is/who he works for. </TEXT>

The newer versions of utorrent are filled with ads..maybe it was doing you a service.

http://filehippo.com/download_utorrent/9859/

Download this, it's the most reccomended older version of utorrent. If you still get a warning then theres a virus on your computer that's changing the download links. Switch to ESET Nod32 (Norton is a POS) and run a full scan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have no idea what you're talking about. GazelleGames is in comparison with something like PtP or BTN is extremely easy to get into. They even have a recruiting thread on bB (/r/baconbits) where you just need to be a member for 1 month and have a ratio of 1.05, which essentially means just being a member for a month. No waiting for a year like you said.

The reason most private trackers don't open for registration (I think) is because they want to control the number of users, but the large majority of them have invite threads on 'gateway' trackers that require nothing more than power user (again, trivial to get). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to say I agree with him. Your post comes off as one: making a very reasonable point about respecting other peoples opinion, which 99% of rational people will agree with. Two: arguing against minors being able to deny potentially life saving treatment, which is without a doubt a much more controversial opinion. The first is generally agreed upon by all rational people, and the second is up for debate until the world explodes.

It's also one that both me and him (and the votes) agree detracts very much from your first point.

I personally see your first point only being made because of your second point, i.e., although I can appriciate how the first point is unrelated and still relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're *really* reading too much into it. I think in the context that -bro is used in EvE it seems like a more blanket term, that isn't meant to include gender politics, but is used to connate a role that attracts friendship. It's not implied that your female or male, because no one actually knows what you are behind the screen. Anyone using the term like that does not represent the majority, and their defenition should not be taken as fact.

Personally i've only ever heard of logibro (when a logi saves someones ship) and newbros (because the game needs new players to survive) being used widely. Wormbro is a name of a corporation, and not something that fits the majority of the -bros. 

It's not hard to get around the perception of exclusion, because there is none! Anyone that hears the -bro terms being used in context enough knows that to be true.

For some context i've been playing for about a year, and have been in large-very large corps for the majority of that time (so it's not like I play market pvp 24/7 in my 0% tax corp). </TEXT>

If there wasn't anything like eve-survival, people would just setup a channel and do it that way instead. And you would still have probably died because you wouldn't have read the comments there. Or even if the guide was made by CCP, can you honestly say you would have read the comments?

<TEXT> I've played with the worst of players in League of Legends, this is much much worse, simply because people can completely destroy your EvE experience, and you cant just leave a game like you can in League and forget about it. 

The 'bonus room' was a 'service' created by a scammer. Once he scammed someone he would have them go into his teamspeak and make them degrade themselves IRL, or completely devalue their character (imagine making someone lose rating from diamond to bronze), just so they could get their assetts and money back (he still wouldn't give it back 9/10 times). He and his buddies were eventually permanently banned from EvE. 
http://jestertrek.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/the-bonus-round.html

There really isn't any permanence of meeting a troll in league, apart from maybe losing some rating and 40 minutes of your time. In EvE, the scumbags can kill your ship which you've spent actual days farming for. To be fair, if you're smart about it you probably will only be scammed once, it's the people who are ignorant of what's encouraged (scamming) that get bit the worst. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damping is basically the more reliable version of ECM. Personally I prefer ECM to dampening, purely because it's more rage inducing. You're right, things like the scorpion do tend to get primaried. I'd suggest going into the tech 2 frigates for small gang (Keres and Hyena are the most favoured) and the Recon for fleet/black ops fights (although even those tend to die fast, as they're not very tanky at all). Something to note too, techinically the Armageddon (Amarr battleship) is an EWAR ship as it gets very good bonus' to neuts. I even think BRAVE might have it as its doctrine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should take out those pictures of the GM conversation, pretty sure that's against the rules. Not sure what that GM's on about either. At least from my interpretation Rule 7 just states that you can't *list* items for sale, not that you have to return them if the owner forgets them. The FAQ pretty clearly states you lose those items afterwards. I could be missing something, however, and this is just my uninformed opinion.

Edit: I see how you could interpret that rule to mean that you're not allowed to leave any assets in the character, this does however seem to contradict that FAQ. </TEXT>

Again, you're right, if this dude is telling the truth (which he probably isn't) then he should just go to CCP/the police, my intentions are selfish (mostly). Also awesome username by the way! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right, he should, if he has concrete proof on that, which he probably dosen't. Getting someone to verify his identity is really a service to the community, more than anything, so that we know for 99% sure that          the titan kill was wrong, and that anyone trusted at alliance level in CFC is likely to be doxxed illegally. It would be a huge blow to the CFC. </TEXT>

At least in solo pvp if you want to even try to win the majority of fights, you should have at least all level 4 on the related skills.

Sharing money from invites is probably referring to the 21 day trial invite.

<TEXT> When warping from system to system (BRAVE Corp.), they got caught in a warp disruption bubble that stops their warp and traps them inside the bubble, stopping them from warping off. As soon as this happened Rooks and Kings used the most expensive ship in the game (titan) to teleport themselves into that bubble. Rooks and Kings were in specially tanked, AOE damage dealing ships. So essentially it's like a group of people walking into an ambush and then throwing molotov cocktails on their faces. Really effective, hard to pull off.

<TEXT> Hey,

My apologies in advance if this is in bad etiquette, i'm not sure what the rule is regarding meta/self posts on this sub. 

I don't really frequent this sub, but after looking through the comments of http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2k30b0/i_cant_stop_winning_chili_cookoffs/ this post I can't really say that I will now, or understand why anyone else does.

I understand people are passionate about what they love, whether that be chilli or food in general, but there's really no need for the amount of pure vitriol and hatred in that thread. The OP came here to share their love for food, and it's really disgusting that people feel the need to post/upvote (gross 46 upvotes) shit like this: 

Jesus fucking christ. This is almost as bad as that retard last week who posted cheetos and beef jerky as snacks to go with wine. Sonnn.
Recipe for award winning chili: grab a can of everything from the Hispanic shelf at Walmart. Dump in crockpot. Eat with fritos.

and this (gross 15 upvotes)

That looks fucking disgusting. Also, it's not chili, it's "Kentucky Bean and Corn Surprise."

These are only two examples of the purely malicious comments that were posted in that thread. How can you expect people to share in your passion if you try to bully them into accepting your opinion?

If this gets removed because meta/self posts aren't allowed then my only hope is for the mods to take this into consideration.

If it dosen't, then please, think before you type. There's people behind the computer screens, and damn good  way to share your passion for something, and maybe change their opinion, is to be friendly about it, and to teach them like their your friend, not the enemy.

Cheers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming that's the case I don't disagree. And I can completely understand how they might have intended that post to classify this as an exploit, but taking that rule with no context (which shouldn't have to be provided, it should speak for itself), it's ambiguous. I don't think arguing this is going to change anything, however. I understand your point, and if you're right CCP will reimburse the person and maybe banhammer the offenders. Good talk. </TEXT>

If you're referring to the CCP post, it heavily implies that it's talking about lighting a cyno while the forcefield is already online. I agree it's an exploit (at **best** a clever use of game mechanics) but i'm just not so sure it's *official*. </TEXT>

Or did people know that they could light one inside an already lit forcefield, as the post implies? Apologies for my ignorance, but I wasn't around for this exploit.

Still, your below post right, it's stupid to even walk on the thin line, whatever CCP's stance. Hopefully this will provoke a statement from them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TotalBiscuit explains (possibly) why here: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ngk4v1 

Tl;dr; looks murky because they only gave out pre-release codes to people they sponsored, but the DMCA claim makes it look like WB Games registered the cutscenes with Content ID, and they're being taken down autotmatically.

Although this is still only speculation as to why the videos were taken down, I don't think we can know exactly if they were DMCA'd manually, or be Content ID. </TEXT>

http://publishing.wsu.edu/copyright/fair_use/ (See Amount of the Material Copied.)

The precendant for that 1% was set by  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_v._Warner_Books , but that was in conjunction with the fact that it was an educational piece. 

I'd appriciate if you could come up with a source.

Edit: Not only that, but 1% of 174 seconds (the length of his video) is 1.74. seconds. My clip was 7 seconds long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry mate, but even if he is protected by fair use (and I checked US fair use laws a few times before posting this) the least he can do is send me a message telling me he put it in. Thank you for providing an opposing view though, it's always good to get both sides of an argument. </TEXT>

The only thing's I care about is this:

He made no attempt to contact me. He had to have downloaded and reuploaded the video, hence the shitty quality. I could have even provieded him with a clean copy through something like dropbox, but he's too big to care I guess.

<DATE> 2014-07-26 07:50:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just read the devlog and Garry stated how he liked creating the tool for the clothes previewing and disliked not many people using it. This lead me to thinking about something lke what Valve has to implement player made gun/clothing models. 

Possibly we could have something like that, something that goes through a strenuous review process then gets added to the game. Alternatively something that just allows for a server to install a limited ammount of extra textures, a la modding. 

At least then the tool's he creates for the devs will reach more people (don't get me wrong though, the usage of the tools is an extension of the whole modding/community created content, not the other way round).

This is still a really open ended idea, and i'd love to hear peoples thoughts on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure why people are saying this is impossible. A possible vector of attack includes, for example, impersonating someone that got something wrong. "I sent you x, but really meant to send you y. My boss has been on my ass all day, would you mind changing it really quickly for me?". 

Most techniques like this require inside information into how they run things. What lingo do they use? How do they use it? Possibly you're an intern who dosen't know what they're doing.

 The bottom line is, impersonate someone in their chain of command, then use empathy or fear to get them to do shit for you. If you're looking for straight up SE discussion you might be better off in /r/realsocialengineering , generally people care less about morals or why you're doing something over there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really? If you use something like Airbnb you can get some pretty good accommodation for 45~ pounds a night, and if you pick the right place, a good host who is kind, and will answer any questions. 

If you eat out every day then, yes, like any other country it will be expensive, although granted it's still not 'cheap' if your making your own meals.

Not sure what you mean by a nightmare traffic system? If you mean in terms of road congestion then you're going to find that in any large city you go to, not just London.

With the mass transit you just need to use the replacement bus' services on weekends, otherwise AFAIK they're usually pretty good about keeping everything open in the week days. It's not like you won't be able to get somewhere just because they've blocked off a few tube stations.

The people are welcoming when you get to know them. The stranger culture, on the other hand, is different than most American states, you won't find strangers being quite as cuddly towards each other. For the most part however, 99% of strangers i've encountered are kind and helpful. Just like any other large city.

In terms of things 'to do', as well, there's pretty much an endless list of museums, places to visit, clubs to go to, beautiful architecture, etc etc etc.

<TEXT> Just wanted to point out your description of airstone, made me laugh because it reads like one of those infomercials (/r/hailcorporate?).

We used airstone for the patio.  It's great because it is 75% less weight than real stone, so you don't need to build any footers, yet it still looks and feels like real stone.  It's cheaper than real stone, you can only get it at Lowe's.  It's best to cut it with a hack saw, but you could also use a band saw if needed.  No need for any mortar or mess, you simply apply it with any outdoor construction adhesive (we used locktite) and you're good to go!

1.This post reeks of insecurity. No one that's remotely successful in real life feels the need to defend themselves in a 1500 word essay to a bunch of internet strangers, unless of course they're, in some way, invested in that community. Why take the time?

I really have no interest in this game or community anymore

Seriously? See my above point.


 2.You still haven't apologized for when you did flame him. No 'sorry', no 'I guess I did something bad'. In fact, you completely avoid the matter of reconciliation and just say that the fact that you've stopped is enough. Seriously, WTF? Anyone with basic reasoning skills can see the absurdity of this.

3.The fact that you just deleted the comment you got called out on (http://i.imgur.com/rnYE344.png) means we can't trust your comment history, or your claims of not flaming him in 6 months.You even reply to that comment not with a humble or an apologetic tone, but with the words "Haha I forgot about that". Seriously? Is this how a person who works "full time in a STEM field" acts? Although TBH doing tech support is working in a STEM field too, I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the detailed answer, it's interesting hearing your perspective on it. On the thing about C/C++ i've made some pretty long programs in Java, will that come in useful? I assume people have made malware embedded in java programs before? Also, should I just randomly choose whether to go with C or C++ or perhaps go for C++ because thats closest to what I know? 

Another question, what do you mean by 'learn the PE'? Do you mean just getting an overview of it through somewhere like this website: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx or is there a book that you could recommend? Cheers again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cheers for the detailed reply. I'll definately look into that python book. What's your take on C/C++ in terms of priority to learn for analysis? I've heard that Java and C++ are quite similar so the leap wouldn't be that hard for me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I already know a bit of java, from what i've heard it's useful to know C/C++ (both?), Assembly, and Python(?), which one should I learn first? 

For books, i've read on this subreddit that Malware Analyst's Cookbook and Practical Malware Analysis are the best? Any other books you'd recommend? I have a basic background in CS, nothing graduate level however. 

Would you recommend I read up on other, broader, fields before Malware Analysis, perhaps something like forensic analysis for windows?

Cheers.

If you're completely new to the game: do the tutorials, do the sisters of eve quest line. Look at this website: http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ and find out what you want to do. Join a corp for it. Get better at it, and above all have fun. </TEXT>

<TITLE> LoL casters, please don't use the word 'tryhard'. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Heard this said on an official stream, what does this word even mean at that level of play? You're not going to see some of these professional players not actually trying to play, or just taking the games as if they were playing normal solo q, playing with their eyes half closed not giving a shit.

Not only that but it's insulting to the player to say that just because someone under performed it means they weren't trying hard enough.

Sorry if this is a bit harsh, but that word is mostly used by people who call people better than them tryhards and people worse than them noobs. It's a really stupid word, and has no place at that level of play.

Thoughts?

<TITLE> How do I run a scenario with less than the 'required' palyers? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-11 10:58:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey,

I'm looking to run an Eclipse Phase scenario with some of my mates (two) and the only problem is the majority of the scenarios come with a 'required' amount of four players. I however see people/books saying that it is possible to run a scenario with less players, but no where have I read how I would alter the scenario for less players.

Let's say there's four enemys they have to face, do I just halve that down to two enemys? Or would I halve some of their stats instead?  Of course it isn't always as simple as this, so i'd be interested and appreciate any help people could give.

The scenario i'm interested in is Glory, if that helps.

Cheers. </TEXT>

Does anyone have a link to a list of support skills that you should prioritize on making a new character? I've seen plenty of lists but they usually just list all of them instead of which are most important. 

Also if anyone knows what support skills are good to train if you don't know what EWAR race you'll be flying but want to generally go ewar?

<TEXT> The goal of zen is to trick the ego, i.e. to trick it into making the illusion go deeper and deeper, until eventually you are able to look back at the game you've played and realise the futility. Only then you can live half as the ego, and half as the God head, as a true genuine fake. Playing the game of life, just as you always did, in the same way as you always will.

Maybe Enso represent the full circle that the ego takes on its journey to be extinguished ?

I think people take the rituals too seriously, but maybe that's the point.

Just some thoughts, take them as you will. </TEXT>

If I do end up making something for you I don't really mind how much doge you give me, just not a stupid amount.

Will check back later on today and get on any requests!

I'd like to continue tanking, so can I do heroics now or do I have to get better gear before I start them? Where would I get this gear ? Also, I have about 314 Ghost Iron Ore and I was wondering If i should keep them and prospect them when my jewelcrafting gets high enough or turn them into bars and AH them or get a blacksmith to make me gear with then? Any ideas? Thank you for any help!. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm genuinely curious, it would be my #2 or 3. It certainly has it's moments, and Picard is played almost to perfection, but dosen't it seem a bit dull compared to something like DS9 or ENT S4 ? It seems to have all the good elements of what a Star Trek series should be, but the only element that stands out to me as being the hallmark of TNG is it's affinity for a philosophical undertone, which all of the Star Trek series have. Could it be that's the one that most people on the internet grew up with ? Thoughts ? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Heya, iv'e been playing for two days now and iv'e been trying to get into the mage control class. Now I always try and wait for the opponent to make their move, so that I can get the card advantage and what not; but most of the time they also wait for my move and so it becomes almost a stale mate. This stays until I play a card and they end up assassinating it or whatever, and they always end up getting more cards on the board. Anyone have any tips that would help someone like me ? Just basic stuff; iv'e watched kripp/ls's videos so far.

Also, can anyone lead me to any resources for building a strong mage control deck ? I don't have any Legendaries yet but iv'e unlocked all the mage basic cards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,

So far in my code i've set it up where I simply switch out my panels in my frame when I need to change what is shown on the screen. I've been looking at a few tutorials for making a 2D sidescrolling platformer game, but all of these tutorials start from scratch and i'm having trouble implementing them into my code. 

Could someone give me some advice as to what would be the best way to go about this that dosen't require me to rewrite my code ? 

http://www.mediafire.com/download/67iudjaxl5gfmmp/Game.zip those are my project files, if you need the actual images I can pm you them but i'd rather not make them public.

Thank you for any assistance! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Zazen formality's </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-11 00:00:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few questions, i've recently been listening to Alan Watts talking about meditation, namely Zazen.

 I'm wondering, do you keep your eyes open or closed ? I think I remember him saying that the monks would keep their eyes half open, as zazen's way is not to exclude any of the senses. 

When doing the crouching position, do you sit on your heels (it's a bit uncomfortable, maybe it's meant to be that way ? ) or do you turn them on their sides ? I don't have the round pillow, only a small cushion which I sit on. 

What do you concentrate on when meditating ? If someone could provide me a recourse or even better, explain it here, that would be awesome.

Thank's in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey,

So i've been watching a really awesome D D series called 'RollPlay' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsFwQMjeWuo). I know that the DM is running on 2e. How hard would this be to get into with no experience of D D ?

 I'd probably be the DM for 2 or 3 other friends. Would it become pretty clear how they do it if I were to start out with 4e first ? I really like how it's more story/ 'theatre of the mind' (as described in the sidebar) rather than combat oriented (although the combat does seem a bit drab). Maybe it would be a better idea to go with 4e with a more freeformed gridless play like they did ? 

He describes in this post how he's changed the rules of the original 2e to sort of update it : http://www.reddit.com/r/itmejp/comments/196d2n/rollplay_wrap_up_for_week_2_campaign_info_plus_qa/c8lfeum

Cheers for any help or advice!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really don't know much about US Politics but i was under the impression that it wasn't a religious country ? Did he just say that to appeal to the religious majority ?

 I remember seeing these quotes on the Newsroom, "As the government of the United States is not, in any sense founded on the Christian religion--" -John Adams (The Treaty of Tripoli)

"...that our civil rights rights have no dependence on our religious opinions.." - Thomas Jefferson

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." - First Amendment

EDIT : Just realized that the title might be a bit unclear, by a 'religious country' I mean not that the majority of it's population might be religious (which may or may not be the case, idk) but that the country is and always will be a religious nation, founded 'under God'. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help with 6950 sound/performance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-02 01:15:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Iv'e got an ATI ScanFX (UK brand) 6950, and I put an aftermarket Accelero Xtreme cooler on top of it because it was just making way to much noise and heat. It's on 1100mV Voltage, 800MHz core clock, 1250MHz Memory clock. 

When watching a 1080p movie the fan bumps up to 80% speed, and the fan stays at 90deg. Even on some older games like Darksiders 1 it ends up ovearheating (although I can run bioshock infinite on low for hours on end). My question is, is the fan speed/heat normal ? It's still pretty loud when it's on full load. Maybe i'm expecting too much. Thanks!

Also looking for some help to upgrade this some time in the future, made a thread on /r/buildapc (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1bdzhe/upgrading_2_year_old_pc/) if any of you don't mind looking at that. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, wondering what/when I should start upgrading my build ? I can only play bioshock infinite on low and i'd like to play that and other games like that on high in the future. My current build : 
Intel Core i5-25000k @ 3.3GHz (Never got around to overclocking it, how much would it affect gaming ?)

8GB(2x4GB) Corsair XMS3 DDR3 PC3-10

Coolermaster CM 690 II Advanced

1GB ScanFX HD 6950, PCI-E 2.0 (x16)

Accelero Xtreme 6950 Cooler

620W Seasonic S12II-620 Bronze

Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD3-B3, Intel P67

Coolermaster CM 690 II

Like I said I can run most games that came out in the past year on high/ultra, just want to futureproof for 2~ more years. Probably just looking for a better GPU, something like a 7979 or a 680 ? Cheers. </TEXT>

AFAIK GSL is just comprised of Groups A-H, and then they fight it off and then it's done, is that just one season then they repeat it 4 times orrr ?

 Should I buy a season or a yearly ticket if i want to watch it to the grand finals ? Thank you!

<TITLE> Is destiny's twitch chat perma subscriber only now ?  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-27 00:26:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **N.B. None of the below means anything if this is just temporary and will stay temporary. The reason i'm making this thread is (as the title suggests) because I have a *lack* of information.**

 I think people will agree that his twitch chat is definitely one of the most entertaining things to be around or even participate in.

 Taking away the large majority of people's ability to chat is really off putting for me to be on his stream now. Now you can relate this to why he switches games, to get more money (At least afaik, maybe twitch admins are the real nazis?) but at least that doesn't hinder the actual 'experience' of being on destiny's channel (please stop me if this gets too meta edgy for you). It's so much more entertaining when he pulls of a crazy 1v3 and the whole chat explodes, retards and all.

Edit : In anticipation of 'why don't you just join raidcall', I want to be able to open his twitch page and directly talk to him. There's also the problem of annoying as fuck adverts (I have both of stevens stream pages whitelisted on adblock). mini tldr: practicality.

Edit 2 : Has anyone noticed how fucking boring the twitch chat is now ?

Edit 3 : Nice idea by Janeway, " Subscriber Janeway_ta: I am all for raidcall chat being his go-to chat. I think that's totally cool, it allows him the control he needs and gives people a way to talk to him. But censuring Twitch chat seems to me to be counterproductive. Rather than trying to enforce an artificial level of decorum in Twitch chat, I think he should just go completely hands-off twitch." I like the idea of having two chats, one that might have more 'decorum' as previously described, possibly not hands off but maybe just the Dharma bott to stop actual spammers. 

tl;dr Chat integral part of lay destiny experience. Back pls. #naziamerica #basedtwitchat </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's just a tad confusing but from what I can see it really depends on your standpoint, for instance, if you take up that all scientific theories can be reduced to being logically primitive (you can't explain the scientific law behind the scientific law behind the scientific law etc etc, it all has to be un explainable somewhere down the line) then I assume this makes it theory ? And then the standard pragmatist atheist would believe it fact because of the evidence ?

<TITLE> Where does my viewpoint fit in with Deism ?  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-05 01:07:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, just wondering in what school/sub-school my viewpoint would fit in. The belief that God (or a deity if you will) created the universe, but does not interact with it in any way. So all he was there for was to create the universe, either he dissapeared or he might as well have. I would side with the standard deistic ideals but i'm not sure I agree that observing the natural world is enough to prove the existence of God.

I could be misunderstanding things whereas the whole idea of God creating the natural world means that he existed ? Not quite sure on that part. Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some games including Serious sam (the new one) darksiders 1, COD Black ops cause my PC to crash after about 10~ minutes of gameplay, first the video goes then the audio and I have to reset it to get my PC to work again. I'm on quite a good machine : 

AMD 6950 @ 1920x1080

i5 25k not overclocked

8gb ram

MSI-7681

DX11, latest graphics drivers (just checked) 

Good cooling system, idle temp is 42c, at first I thought it was just cooling but even some games like Civ 5 which cause my gpu to run at 100% I can play for hours with no trouble, while an older and less graphically intensive game like darksiders does. Any ideas ? Best thing I can come up with is that some engines cause my gpu to overheat/crash. Any help welcome!

Hi, thanks for clicking on this and if you will, taking the time to read what I wrote. I'm completely knew to writing for 'fun' and would like some general feedback more on how I can tell the story more like a story. I realise I probably got a lot wrong ! I wasn't really happy with my character names  but they will do. Of course any critique is welcome, whether it's on the story, the descriptive parts or just how I write. Could you tell who was telling the story and did you expect the ending to be what it was ?
Thanks.~~~~

They say behind every great man theres a greater woman. Sure.

Its remains sat still on the warm, sticky tarmac, the stench of lifelessness emanating like burnt toast from a morning fresh kitchen. So much emotion, all in a smell.
 	
 	
They chose the poor thing for one reason  selfishness. Their desire for an emotional attachment to a soul that wouldnt judge them, that wouldnt give up if they forgot to do the washing up, or left the oven on. That is what makes them despicable, fate didnt neglect its need for food or its predatory instincts, I didnt put in a cage like some bacteria under a microscope. No. They did. And that is what makes them the most despicable creatures I created.				
      
 Their journey starts at the pet shop. A family of three, leading the way is the father, Tom. Short, about five foot nine, slick short, curled back black hair and the swagger to match it. The epitome of my perfection. Retreating behind him is the mother, Mary-Anne. For the purpose of this story no description is nessacary. All you need to know is that she was a coward and by far the worst example of a human being I could possibly give, envy and loathing were second nature to her cruel mind. Last is the son of the family, George. He plays the largest role, the protagonist of our short story. 10 Years old, brown hair like his mother and blue eyes like his father.
 	
Their family was, at best, lower middle class. Tom worked for the Ontario police force           Chief Detective Tom Hilde Roberts. Mary-Anne stayed at home, looking after the dishes, the carpets and the child. The child, yes, George was George  he was the innocent in this.
 	
So, back to the pet shop. As they walked in the squeals of creatures echoed, from the squeaks of mice to the moans of cats and dogs, innocently being pawned off. Lucky for them (and us) they were not aware of this. The Roberts had gone out looking for a cat, Tom was the leader in this little endeavour, and where he went Mary-Anne followed.
 	
George, of course, being the child that he was, was ecstatic! A wonderful, fluffy, cute new friend to play with. The three of them walked up to the cats and before Tom could finish his word George leapt out from the cover of his father and said that one! They agreed on this, and soon enough took the cat home along with the full set of amenities. 
 	
This cat was black, from head to paw, eyes like deep black Obsidian gemstones, always heavy on the human heart, always joyful. Persuading humans was second nature to her.
 You havent seen a cuter animal than this.
 	
 She would look up at you, as if she was inquiring as to the nature of her existence  George would look back, with his curiosity peaking he was in a very similar situation, just on a different scale. They were perfect for each other, thats why they had to be split up; or at least thats what Mary-Anne thought.
 	
You cant just have that cat as a friend, I wont let you. Im your mother and I wont allow such an unhealthy relationship to continue she used to say. Weeks passed, Mary-Anne when she was at home would look back at the cat in a completely different way. Instead of looking at the cat like George, filled with curiosity, she despised the thing. Mary-Anne saw the cat as something that was dismantling their precious family. Of course this family didnt exist. A simple creation of Mary-Annes imagination, of course she believed this, and thats all that mattered.
 	
The calendar read June 7th, everybody and everything was relatively normal for a Saturday, half the time Tom would have to spend his Saturday at the office, this was one of those days. George ,Mary Anne and the Cat where home. George was playing very innocently with the Cat, with a smile on his face and laughter coming from his room. His mother called him down to do his chores, first up was taking out a relatively small rubbish bin. George passed through the kitchen and his mother, who was at the time drying off the dishes, saw his smile. She turned her head in anguish and gave out a negative hmph,  turning her head back to the attention of the sink.
 	
George returned from the garden, twilight was beginning to set over the suburban city blocks, giving any sounds or locomotion a dim calm. This was about to be shattered. George returned into the kitchen. Mary-Anne watched him come in from the cold. She tried to make herself believe she cared for him. She didnt. Mary-Anne saw his neutral-ness turn into a smile. She turned her head to see George and Cat connecting in the happiness that they had. She shouted. Bellowed from the top of her lungs. Anger in its purest form was let out. GET OUT ! GET OUT OF MY SIGHT ! She pointed to the door as Georges smile turned into a frown.
	
George ran outside in the simple sadness that a child could have. He ran to the front door ,eyes filled with tears. The portal opened, he ran.. Heart beating like never before. George covered his eyes to wipe the tears off, to clear his vision. Too late.
 	
Its remains sat still on the warm, sticky tarmac, the stench of lifelessness emanating like burnt toast from a morning fresh kitchen. So much emotion in a smell.
	
So Tom sat, holding George on the  road of his sons final resting place. A heartbroken expression was conveyed to Mary-Anne, eyes and mouth big. She stood in the doorway,  washing up gloves and all. Minutes passed as Tom simply starred at her, as if to say you. As if to act surprised. 

Sure.

<TITLE> The desensitization of racial slurs, possible ? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-05-28 19:00:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a lack of a better sub-reddit (to my knowledge, i'm sure there is one out there) i'm posting this here - my thoughts are something like this : If the majority of people that get offended by racial slurs ( Chinese, African Americans etc.) agreed to banish the official meaning, literally to ignore that it ever had any meaning then anybody that tried to use racial slurs in an offensive manner would be as useful as calling someone a table.

I've never actually had any formal philosophy education so my thoughts are sort of everywhere (and iv'e read on this sub-reddit that philosophy helps you to organize thoughts and concepts) so if anybody could help me out just to develop this, or drive it into the ground if it's flawed (tbh there's probably a good chance it is) please feel free to. 
Thanks. </TEXT>
