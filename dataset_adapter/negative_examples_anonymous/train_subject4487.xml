<TEXT> Let's run the math on a flat 25k contracts.

[One contract = 100 troy ounces](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold_contract_specifications.html)

25,000 contracts x 100 oz = 2,500,000 ozt.

[29,166.6667 ozt in one short ton](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+troy+ounces+in+a+ton ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8).

2,500,000 ozt / 29,166.6667 = **85.7 tons**

Is that right? Someone dumped 85 tons of gold? Is my math working out? </TEXT>

<TEXT> They've been selling that for a while. If you're really looking to pick it up, check back with them regularly. It's the lowest premium on a platinum coin I regularly see, though I'd personally rather have a platinum CML on a good deal. The "out of stock" may just be out of stock for this sale, again, I've seen the platypus in their store for a while.

They also have a 1 oz palladium CML.  It was $696 over this weekend, it's up to something like $721 when I was checking their current auctions earlier today. </TEXT>

A lot of front end *whatever* people nowadays *are* formal CS folks. This is the way front end has been moving so expect to see a lot more of this.

Most software "engineers" don't engineer anything, they build things.  The people who write the libraries and frameworks we use, those are typically engineers.  The people who use those libraries and frameworks are typically developers.  People like "engineer" in their job title because it makes them sound more important than they really are. See also "Senior".

At the end of the day, it's just a job title and doesn't matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is getting nearly $800 million dollars from the feds for about 20 passenger rail improvement projects.

Amtrak has cost the government over $45 billion in subsidies over the last 44 years, allowing it to finance the upkeep of unprofitable routes, overstaffed trains, and the mismanagement of its food services.

Despite generous taxpayer subsidies, Amtrak has run operating losses every year since it began operating in 1971. Although these losses are declining, in 2014, the railroad reported what it described as a strong result, with an operating loss of only $227 million.

The operating loss is unlikely to continue to decline due to the losses in Amtraks long-distance routes, which bleed about $600 million annually. After factoring in depreciation and other expenses, Amtrak lost a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. 

Amtrak has had 44 years to become solvent without success.

Decent deals. I'm in the market for the gold eagle (or buff), but I'm holding out hoping for better prices.

I also saw a 1oz palladium CML on Bay Precious Metals ebay if anyone is looking.  Don't know if it's a decent deal, just the first time I noticed them selling palladium.

Anyone know of any other deals this weekend? If so, please list them up.

<TEXT> You should continue to buy in small amounts according to how much discretionary $ you have.

Don't sell the house and "back up the truck" and use all your $ in one massive purchase.  Buy 20, 40, or 60 ounces today...no big deal.  You're just cost averaging down.

Then wait and see if the paper price goes down into the 14's again and then buy another 20, 40, or whatever fits your budget. 

There's no right or wrong about it as long as you can handle whatever you have purchased in your budget and aren't going to be a fucking cry baby if the price drops a dollar :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Batman is the best JavaScript framework!

There's also AngularJS which is similar to Ember.js but they have different names. Backbone and Cappuccino are similar in that they start only one letter apart from each other. Chaplin should get an honorary mention since we're in the C's. There is also EXT JS which literally shouts at you about how good it is, unlike Meteor and React, let alone SproutCore.  JavaScript MVC is near the top of the list as well because just by the name you know it's related to javascript.

But Batman is the best.

I don't see how you can say that. What do you know about the guy?  He's had the recent bad APMEX/USPS stolen and now a USPS misdelivering to a PO Box.  He has a lot of videos up so it seems a lot has gone right for him.

I found him via his APMEX story and I'm glad I did. He's bringing to light and reenforcing what we should all be cognizant of when buying/selling non-locally.

I felt for him in regards to the APMEX scenario.  The latest issue I don't feel so bad for him, though, as I outlined his two mistakes (at least IMO) in my OP up top.  I still think hjis experience is worth sharing here. I'm surprised so many seem to be brushing it off as he's just a whiny bitch.

I'm curious how you would handle the situations he's had. You wouldn't reach out to the stacking community in some venue? </TEXT>

Mentions he sent two separate packages in a trade deal. Two separate packages because it wouldn't fit in one priority mail package.  This was mistake #1.

Mentions "this was not a cheap trade, I would have been out quite a bit" but he cheaps out and didn't send it registered with proper insurance. This was mistake #2.

No mention of what happened to the 2nd package (at least I didn't seem to catch it).  Seems to have been left with "it's out for delivery" despite it being delivered to the post office (box).

This guy can't catch a break with USPS lately.

**Question for you guys selling over at /r/pmsforsale, how are you shipping? What are you doing re: insurance?**

I've had three or four phone screens with other companies during that time, but I never asked them if they looked at my github, I only ask at the end of in-person interviews.  I don't interview in-person a whole lot, though, I'm somewhat selective, meaning I don't go on in-persons just because they've asked me in.

Thats basically what it comes down to when your train shows up and theres only one car instead of two. At least *something* showed up.

I can *personally* respect and appreciate their "hey, fuck you" blunt response, but their PR could use a little polishing for the masses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO, they're essentially treating some of their inventory as loss leaders, buying feedback if you will, trying to get that power seller status so people keep coming back, new people come in with confidence they won't get hosed.  I would imagine they'll be raising prices in the future.  Not all of their inventory is a deal, as well...They have a kilo Koala for $598, both APMEX and Provident are around $30 cheaper, I think it was when I compared.

I've had a good purchase through them, though their shipping is slow if you're on the west coast.  Didn't get tracking until the 3rd biz day after the buy-it-now.  UPS Ground is 5 days coast-to-coast, so 8 day shipping for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's Java.  

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced classes to JavaScript (ECMAScript is JavaScript if you're not aware). The caveat being ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over the objects and prototypes devs are used to when working with "classes" in JavaScript.

Here's an example of an ES6 class (not a function in sight):

    class View {
        constructor(options) {
            this.model = options.model;
            this.template = options.template;
        }

        render() {
            return _.template(this.template, this.model.toObject());
        }
    }

We're interviewing front-end devs where I work and over the past month we've probably done phone screens with 10 candidates. Only one could talk about ES6, the others couldn't tell me one thing about what's new in ES6. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over the past year or so my boss and I have interviewed over a hundred JavaScript developers

Every try to quantify to your pinhead boss how much $ you're wasting with your obviously shitty interview process?

Over the phone he claims that it should only take the candidate about 20 - 30 mins to complete.

Have your boss take it. Where is he coming up with this time frame?

I feel we've lost a lot of potentially great developers due to this

You have. On the bright side, at least you guys are just doing bullshit work all day long since you don't really need another developer. Also, by the time you find a developer who is up to snuff as per your boss, that framework he passed the test in will be deprecated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked on a large healthcare initiative (think Obamacare) a couple years ago and we used the natural language form interface (where you fill out a form to make a sentence of your intentions).

It did not test well, which was surprising to me. We ended up using traditional forms, which work very well.

One thing that's always missing from articles like these is real world data.

<TEXT> Couple of thoughts, take them for what they are:

* I don't get graded coins from a modern run/mintage of 1,000,000. There is probably a ton of 69s out there (they may not be graded, but you're looking at a large mintage that could make it to the graded market).
* I agree with /u/Cantilivewhileim that a MS70 would be "worth it".
* The crocs are sold out at the mint so dealers are jacking the prices.  [SD Bullion is asking $26 a coin](https://sdbullion.com/silver/perth-mint-coins/2014-australian-saltwater-crocodile-silver-1-oz-bu-perth-mint), for example.  I didn't do any other comparison shopping, I just knew they had them in stock as I was browsing them this past weekend.

If you like it, grab it. 20 looks to be not quite $23 USD so it's a good price, I suppose. I picked up a tube last year, I like them.

<DATE> 2015-06-16 05:11:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Casual gamer here, looking for some Steam Summer Sale recommendations.

Skyrim is my favorite game. I'm actually replaying it right now and it's still as beautiful as I remember it. I don't even fast travel. Or take a horse.  Nope, I run the entire map. What I love the most about it is the open world aspect, which makes is not a linear game. It really is an adventure. I also love that you get a lot of game play out of it.

My last game purchase was The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. I picked up the game of the year edition and holy fuck I played that for MONTHS and MONTHS and MONTHS. Really enjoyed that as well, same reasons as Skyrim.

Also played State of Decay which I thought had a lot of potential to be an amazing game but it was just too short.  I still really enjoyed it, though. Good game.

I have some shoot 'em up games, including zombie-types, but I'm looking for more Skyrim'ish type of games to look for on the Steam Summer Sale.  I'll also probably look for a Skyrim expansion pack or something as I think I just have vanilla Skyrim.

Would love some recommendations from you guys with tons more game-play experience.

My PC runs Skyrim with no problems. Video card fans kick on, but no problems with the game play and it loads fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is some amazing footage and the stupidity of humans never ceases to amaze me. Incredibly dangerous situation to be filming that. If the deer managed to spring away that dude could have been the next target and bears are actually pretty fast runners.  I would have run inside, grabbed my 30x06 and would have had a new rug on the way.  The last thing you want is a bear hunting in your neighborhood.

Does anyone know where this took place and the rest of the story?  I'm guessing Alaska but not so sure with the "call somebody" by the videographer at the end.  Alaskans are pretty smart about this kind of stuff, but maybe it's the first time at the vacation house, lol. </TEXT>

Be sure to keep your receipt from BGASC so you have the provenance.  THAT will help more than keeping in a sheet.  This, of course, assumes BGASC is still around when you go to sell, or a buyer remembers them if they're not still around. </TEXT>

Fill up your order cart and see what it says for shipping.  I think it tells you the carrier.  You can add/remove stuff to break $ thresholds and see if the shipping carrier changes.

You could also email them. Their rep posts here so maybe he'll see this and respond.  I'd go through a mock order cart first.

Use templating when that is what you need, i.e., just one-way binding.  The particular templating library doesn't matter.

I used templating on a project late last year. I'm sure a lot of devs would have jumped on the MV* fashion train and really overcomplicated things, IMO.  Keep in mind, I'm particularly lazy, I want to do the least amount of work as possible and leave early to go play with my dog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a fantastic deal. [Paying by check, a buff is 1,228.84](http://www.wholesalecoinsdirect.com/coins/gold/american-buffalo/50-gold-american-buffalo-24-karat).

-$50 discount card is $1178.84.

Spot looks to be $1176 (ask).

The only potential downside I see is the buffs are random year, buffs are 24k which is soft, condition on buffs isn't specified so you're not getting a mint-sealed coin.  Still, $2 over spot...

Also, if you're more into AGEs, APMEX ebay has a current special on them, [2015 1 oz Gold American Eagle Brilliant Uncirculated](http://www.ebay.com/itm/SPECIAL-PRICE-2015-1-oz-Gold-American-Eagle-Brilliant-Uncirculated-SKU-87117-/141523424360?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item20f3741468), $37 over spot @$1215.

If you have to move this up or down stairs, you're probably going to need a crew.

Due to the age, it might/probably has asbestos. It looks in good/sealed condition, but it's something I'd physically inspect to see if there is any dust leakage. (check underneath, too).

You would probably have a hard time finding parts if something went wrong with the locking mechanism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not home to accept/sign for the package.  I have this silly thing called a job. My wife is not home and couldn't sign for the package, either. She's silly as well. My dog is home, but the UPS driver would be like "hey there, cutie pie can you sigh right....OH MY GOD, MY ARM!!!!"

It's over 20 miles (one way) from where I live to where I have to go to pick up UPS deliveries (and I live in a major metro area).  This is where their plant is that I have to pick shit up at. So that's 40+ miles round trip. It's 42.x miles from memory. It's a major hassle to be honest. Time = money.

I'm not the youtuber in the "apmex scam" video I recently posted here, just sharing that.

Bottom line is USPS is incredibly more convenient for me due to where I live. Plus, any theft of USPS becomes a federal offense, unlike a UPS or FedEx theft. So it has that going for it as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get [security doors installed](http://dcs-ind.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DCS-Security-Door-10.jpg).

Most people don't even think about the fact that your front door is "secured" by 1-2 inches of pine wood (look where your deadbolt goes into the frame).  No on realizes how **ridiculously easy it is to kick in a front door**, most people have a real delusion of safety and security when it comes to locking their front door. Pine wood is not strong.

A security door is the best visual deterrent/investment you can make for home security, IMO.  It basically tells the scumbags "my neighbor is an easier target."

The best deterrent is to not send out an invitation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From their [ebay store FAQ](http://stores.ebay.com/baypreciousmetals/faq.html):

 Q: What are your shipping methods?

 A: Bay Precious Metals orders are shipped either US Postal Service or UPS. Each purchase is fully insured at no extra cost and may require an adult signature upon delivery.

So UPS must work out better for them as they replied to me saying:

Your order will be shipped via UPS as that is our current shipping carrier we are using.

They don't appear to be using USPS anymore, despite their FAQ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They may not have a traditional brick and mortar store.  From their [ebay store FAQ](http://stores.ebay.com/baypreciousmetals/faq.html):

 Q: Where do you ship from?

 A: Bridgewater, Massachusetts *(this is south of Boston)*

Googling "bay precious metals massachusetts" doesn't give much. I doubt they have a physical presence.

Here's the customer service number that was in their email signature from my ebay email to them if anyone is interested:

<TEXT> I just placed an order with them a couple days ago.

I can tell you they ship out exclusively UPS, USPS is not an option (as they state on their FAQ).  I emailed them through ebay asking if they could send my order out via USPS as UPS is literally over 40 miles round trip to go pick things up (incredibly inconvenient).  They replied they only use UPS.

Here's where it gets better...

They said there would be no signature required on the delivery.  This is a $900 order that they seem to have no problem having left at someone's door.

I replied to them via ebay with my concerns and never heard back.

At least I have paypal protection. I'm not worried as I'm confident I won't be left holding the bag should anything happen with my package left on my doorstep for hours.

I have not received any shipping notification/tracking. I'm expecting a "delivery" on the 12th or perhaps the 15th.  If I remember right, they're in Massachusetts and they're probably using UPS Ground, so that would most likely be a 5 day delivery for me (I'm west coast).

Regardless, I won't use them again due to them shipping UPS.  The $ I save on an order is not enough for the hassle of going to go pick up a UPS delivery.  Who wants to jump into rush hour traffic after work to get to the UPS plant before they close the customer service desk?  Then get right back in that traffic to go home. It just isn't worth it to me.

I'm a USPS guy all the way, I can ride my bike down and pick things up. Plus any theft becomes a federal offense.

<TEXT> **Any** vendor can do the same thing.  Don't think you're any safer ordering directly anywhere else.

I think the lesson here is to really be cognizant of this situation. If you want purchase protection use your credit card or stick to ebay/paypal.

I have a feeling if that youtuber had gone through an APMEX ebay auction, that first "scam" video would have been a "paypal saves the day with a refund as APMEX denies claim" video and that would have been the end of it. 

It still would have been a major hassle for him but it sounds like he has a slam dunk with the postal inspector. I'd be really surprised if paypal didn't side with the buyer in that case, despite having the package "delivered" confirmation from the post office. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apmex is aware of this and they've provided the typical BS after-the-fact customer service response:

*stillkeepin1 Thank you for your video. We clearly could have handled things differently and would love to get to the bottom of this. We want to learn what went wrong and how we can make things right. We truly apologize for this and understand your frustration. Could you please personal message us with your information so that we may work with our VP of Customer Service and our team on some resolution? You may message us via YouTube or by contacting us at social@apmex.com.*

According to the youtuber **stillkeepin1** APMEX's "customer service" - **what everyone raves about and what we pay more for** - was pretty shit.

[Here's a screenshot of the youtube comments related to the above](http://i.imgur.com/ddFZfCw.jpg).

[Here's APMEX's FAQ page on shipping/handling:](http://i.imgur.com/rlrd3LB.jpg)

**How is my order shipped?**

American Precious Metals Exchange orders are shipped Registered/Insured U.S. Mail,   UPS. Each package is fully insured and may require a signature upon delivery. Packages can take on average 1-10 business days for delivery. The tracking number will be provided via email to you upon date of shipment.

**Is my package insured while in transit?**

American Precious Metals Exchange fully insures all of its shipments. Should anything happen while your package is in transit to you it will be covered by our insurance policy. However, we will not accept responsibility if you have left instructions with any carriers or delivery service to leave parcels un-attended for you without the need for a signature. Or, you have given them instructions to leave your package with someone else such as a building manager, neighbor, drop-off location such as Mail Boxes etc. The UPS Store, etc. When we ship to you, if metals are lost or damaged in transit, it is our responsibility to pursue any claim with the insurance company. If we determine the package is lost or damaged, we file a claim. We reserve the right to re-ship your items or refund your money at our discretion. </TEXT>

Don't go overboard on this, though as you might wake up feeling like crap.  Two works great for me. </TEXT>

* apmex
* mcm
* silvertownelp
* scottsdalesilver
* onfireguy (great place for supplies)

I've never purchased directly from MCM, Silvertowne or Scottsdale before and I've purchased from APMEX more on ebay this year than direct. For me, ebay has taken over in 2015.

Now that JM Bullion is starting to sell, I'm sure I'll be adding them to my ebay purchases. They're great, purchased directly from them and silver.com in the past.

I'd like to see Provident get on ebay.

Lots of ebay sales/deal threads get posted here so keep an eye out for those. Those posts initially get flagged as spam by reddit, but the mods here are pretty good about approving them to show up on the main page in a reasonable amount of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Silver is currently selling at a spot price of $16.82 a troy ounce. A troy ounce is what's used to measure precious metals).

20,000 x $16.82 = $336,400 so OP's title checks out.

A troy ounce is 31.1 grams. There are 453.6 grams to a pound, so a pound of silver is 14.6 troy ounces. At $16.82 a troy ounce, a pound of silver would currently be $245.57 but no one buys silver buy the pound.  The closest common size would be [a 10 oz bar](http://firstunitedreserve.com/catalog/images/10-oz-Johnson-Matthey-10-oz-Engelhard-Silver-Bars-Resized-1.jpg). A 500 gram bar is close as well, but 10 oz bars are more common.

As to how many coins can be made out of 20k ounces, that'd be 20k 1 oz coins like the [American Silver Eagle](http://www.straightsilver.com/american-silver-eagle/images/american_silver_eagle_coins.png), a very popular silver coin issued by the US Mint.

Of course with the photo above, you don't get exactly 20k coins from that because they have to stamp out the silver blanks that the coins get made out of.  The remaining silver gets recycled/melted down and ends up back in a coin or bar, nothing gets wasted (this is probably obvious). </TEXT>

<TEXT> UPDATE 12:02 pm on May 28th: The Portland Police has just released the following update on this collision:

The tow truck driver has been identified as 40-year-old Jolene Friedow of Estacada. Friedow works for North Portland Towing.

The investigation into the crash is ongoing. Investigators have learned that Angeles was riding his bicycle westbound on Southeast Gladstone Street, approaching the intersection with Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard. Friedow was facing eastbound, towing another vehicle, waiting to turn left (northbound) on Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard. Friedow turned left, colliding with Angeles in the intersection.

I'm surprised this was a fatality. Truck was waiting to turn, when turned collided with the cyclist. Both the truck and the cyclist couldn't have been going that fast, was the cyclist wearing a helmet? Did he go underneath the truck? </TEXT>

There was an obvious disconnect because here we are.

Communication problems are not one-sided, they can happen at either end, as I'm sure you're well aware.  You should both be agreeing/confirming what you're discussing, don't just communicate via fire and forget, i.e., "communication was constant" (meaning you told him blah, blah and blah, where he heard blah, blah and yada yada). You should be verifying all parties are on the same page.

Confirm what you discuss at the end of verbal communication.  Follow-up in writing as well where it can be read/re-confirmed (though you don't need to do this all the time).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.ally.com/

Co-worker was just mentioning them (I'd never heard of them before), anyone have any long-term experience and opinions with them?

They're offering 1% on an online savings account (though the APY is variable), doesn't look to be any real restrictions from what I can see. This is the only thing that jumps out at me, but I don't think it would be an issue for me:

*You can make six withdrawals and transfers per statement cycle from your Online Savings Account. The limit is set by federal law for electronic and telephone transactions from all U.S. savings and money market accounts. Please remember, you will be charged a $10 fee for each transaction that exceeds this limit.*

They have no physical branches but I don't think that would be a real problem for me, either.  I'd still have my checking with Chase so I wouldn't be putting all my financial eggs into the Ally basket, so to speak.

I used to have a collection agency call my # asking for a Maribella (I'm a dude).  I ended up just pretending to be her at a certain point. It was great, you know, a guy pretending to be a girl, "yeah, this is Maribella...Wait, what are you calling about?....How much?....Yeah, I'm not going to pay that....Why?....Why should I? You can't collect on it, it's free money" (arguments about my morality continued).  They eventually stopped calling...At one point I just googled Maribella's full name, found her Facebook page where it listed her employer in Beaverton.   I eventually asked to speak to a supervisor and relayed this info and let him know his staff were morons. I found her in literally 20 seconds. Our calls went on for months. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for free screen recording/editing software (Windows 7) to do programming screencasts </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-13 18:18:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all,

I'm looking for some free screen recording and basic editing software (**Windows 7 Home Premium**) that will allow me to do some [programming screencasts like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO07THdLWQo).

I'll be uploading the videos to youtube.

I thought about just doing a google hangout as I'm going to be doing all the screencasts "live",  but I want the ability to stop recording my screen as well as edit my screencasts just so I'm not including a bunch of dead air/crap as I go consult APIs or hit some stumbling blocks or what have you.

I don't need the ability to do the [screen-in-screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKmBt5HDVNI list=PLViRFZPCqDBfkfF0FFbsCVbuMzuoUV6LA) type of screen recording as I don't have a webcam (I built my own PC).

Anyone have any suggestions for Windows 7 Home Premium?

Has anyone used any of these?

* http://camstudio.org/

<TEXT> Even if silver files a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hoping to reorganize its finances, instead of a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy, it typically must cancel and eliminate its original silver, making that silver worthless. Should silver successfully reorganize and become financially sound, it will usually issue new silver, leaving former stackers with worthless silver. If former stackers believe silver will now succeed, they must buy some of the new post-bankruptcy silver should they want to continue their investment.

This should be stickied and become required reading here. </TEXT>

When you have nothing left to learn there that makes you more marketable elsewhere, leave. Building/maintaining shit that doesn't matter for your employer is secondary, your primary job is to make yourself more valuable somewhere else. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would you start a new project today with Angular 1.2? Assume you need to support IE8 in enterprise-land, i.e., glacial browser updates </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-16 20:52:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We have a couple developers here who are throwing around the idea of rewriting an ~ 2 year old app in Angular. It's currently a JSF (Java Server Faces app). I don't think Angular 1.2 is a very good idea at this time and I'd like to hear opinions/justifications by those much smarter than myself.

**We have to support IE8** (we dropped IE7 last year, so not very long ago) and it looks like this would mean we'd need to use Angular 1.2. This is a minor version behind the *current* release of 1.3.

I've read the Angular team plans 1.5 - 2 years of support for Angular *1.3*, but we most likely wouldn't be able to update due to needing IE8 support.  This, to me means we'd essentially be hitting production with a deprecated framework.

As for when we could drop IE8 support and have IE9 as a baseline, that's pretty tough to say.  If 1.3 is supported for 2 years, I would guess it might be possible to upgrade any 1.2 app to 1.3 in 2 years, but then we're back to upgrading to a deprecated framework.

Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x is also a big unknown at this time.  I've read that is an unknown upgrade path as well as the angular team plans to work on an upgrade path.  With the fundamental changes in 2.x, it seems any 1.x to 2.x upgrade will be quite a bit of rewriting, if not mostly a full rewrite.

So I could see it being yet another rewrite in a couple years, which seems a bit ludicrous.

We've never built anything in Angular 1.x, either.  I've done a personal project in 1.3 but that was just to go from reading about Angular to actually doing *something* in it.  This is not saying much as I read and play with a lot of stuff just to go from a 50,000 foot view to a 25,000 foot view.

I've looked at Ember as well, which looks like we'd be topping out (with IE8 support) at [Ember 1.13. They also claim an upgrade to 2.x will be "relatively simple" when you can drop IE8 support](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/45#issuecomment-93009469).

Ember looks like a better choice to me at this particular point in time, but I'd love to hear what you guys would do if you were in enterprise land, needed to support IE8 (for the next couple of years at least) and wanted to build some type of modern MV* app.

<TEXT> Sure, just setup a partial html page that other pages can consume and use jquery's load method.

    $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html" );

If you only want to load part of the page-to-load-into-parent.html page:

    $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html #container" );

Where #container is just the parent element you want to consume. When you have a space after the url, it acts as a jquery selector so the above is loading page-to-load-into-parent.html then filtering it down to just the element with the id of container. </TEXT>

<TEXT> and I'm now following up with scans of 3 of 10 coins I received

Since my original post I've ordered 20oz ASE from another vendor and all arrived without any visible fingerprints or other defects

I think this is key.  In your latter example you ordered a tube so you are most likely getting the coins as they left the mint. Some vendors may go through tubes and cherry pick what they think are the best to send out for grading but I think you have a much better chance with condition by buying in tubes.

What vendor did you purchase the 10 from? </TEXT>

I don't know if the 5 oz is particularly rare. I'd guess not so much but can't really speak with any authority. You don't see the Rarities bars much, but I don't think they're that collectible outside of being an older type of silver bar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a ton of details, but I'd recommend checking out [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/).

It's a MVVM library (not a framework), does pretty much one thing (2-way data binding), can be easily incorporated into any project and has a low learning curve.

I'd also recommend using knockout's mapping plugin which takes care of mapping your json data to your view model. </TEXT>

So let's watch what happens this week. We're at $1,189.40 as I type this on Monday eve.

I'm not finding any silver deals from them, though I'm just looking very quickly, filtering down to bullion--silver--uncertified--1 oz.  I see they have a tube of ASEs for $411 but not much of a deal.  JMB has them for $400 shipped at the moment. Silver spot is $16.82 at the moment so if I'm missing any APMEX silver deals, please post it up for the record. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or you are here protecting you investments. 

You'd be much better off, IMO, if you would have spent that $ on semi-numismatics.  With those generic APMEX bars, you're directly tied to spot price.  Take a look at the price of silver since 2011 - it has crashed.  What if you would have been doing your research then? Would you still have jumped in with the doom and gloom dollar collapse scenario that proliferates from the silver pumpers? Do you really think you'll find yourself in a silver barter situation?

For someone who has done a "ton of research" and "endless research", yet makes a large first purchase of generics, I'd say your research is failing you. I'm not bashing generics as I have generics, but you really need to be aware of what you're buying. Diversification can be fun, but that doesn't mean it will yield you the greatest gains.

I would strongly suggest researching and getting into semi-numismatics where your silver won't be tied to the spot price of silver, which may not have bottomed yet.

Welcome aboard the silver train. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing I've done that works really well is to cut off the cat's paws. I recommend making the amputation at the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Afterwards, they don't really walk much, it's more of a sideways crawl, so they don't have much incentive to leave your property.

You might also consider fusing wheels onto their stumps so they can still skate around the house. If you have an RV pad you can turn that into a playground for them.  Climbing will be a challenge, though cats are pretty resourceful. </TEXT>

* Hit up /r/aww (highlight of my day).
* Daily standup that lasts 40 minutes - fantasize about stabbing co-workers with scissors on scrum master's desk.
* Do some bullshit coding - I have no idea what I'm even doing.
* Constantly rebuild this shit app not because I've fixed anything, I just like to see all that gobbledygook fly across my terminal. Makes me feel like I'm in the Matrix.
* Lunch at my desk because hey look, 7 more bugs have just come in on an outsourced app that uses proprietary everything.
* 2pm cry.
* Hey look, the PM is leaving early again. Honestly, I have no idea what he even does.
* 2:30pm cry.
* Rebuild the app several times in a row - I am the one.
* Check personal email, this time that recruiter email will be a solid lead, I'm sure. Hey look, a company 3,000 miles away is looking for a Java developer.
* 5pm get on train that looks like it's headed to Auschwitz. No one talks to anyone, can't even say "excuse me" when they need to get up or move. Their Bejeweled high score is appalling as well, fucking amateur hour.

<TEXT> I started my new Job as a Junior Web Developer this Monday, and so far its pretty good

It's only Thursday, bro.

The dilemma I have right now, is they program in many different languages with many different frameworks so there isnt a set in stone one to learn

Yep, jack of all trades, master of none.

My issue right now, is what I finished work I go home and have to do further programming to improve my Javascript skills, which does quite interfere with my social life

Yep.

meaning I do drift further away from friends

JavaScript is your only friend now.

as we often connect through playing Games together and skype, which I dont really have the time for now.

    if (life !== fair) {
        tears = true;
        tears.fall();
        delete fun;
    }

I am wondering how you balance your time, while learning new skills/starting new jobs

It all depends on the life you want. Do you want to make good $ and never have a problem getting a job?  Then get used to this because it takes a lot of work to remain relevant, especially when working on the front-end.  It's literally a part time job just trying to keep up.

The Role is mainly front end based for now, but they are keen to get my trained up in back end.

Of course they are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Some quick googling, looks to me like it's $3k](https://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/OLM_015.htm)

*Records for monetary instrument sales are required by the BSA. Such records can assist the bank in identifying possible currency structuring through the purchase of cashiers checks, official bank checks, money orders, or travelers checks in amounts of $3,000 to $10,000.*

I'm assuming a US Postal Money Order is essentially being treated like a "bank" check/money order. Again, this was quick googling.

The woman told me she checked the mark that said it **wasn't suspicious**.

If it wasn't suspicious, why was a SAR filed?  It seems like if they thought you were structuring the $, they would have flagged it as suspicious?  Their actions seem a bit contradictory, though I don't know much about this stuff... </TEXT>

One thing I highly recommend is past life regression therapy. It's amazing and it really does work because it bypasses your normal functioning brain and goes straight for the reptilian brain.

To some extent, yes.

* $500 order is $12.95 shipping
* $1,000 order is $19.95 shipping
* $2,000 order is $29.95 shipping

Do you think that shipping difference is mostly the increased insurance cost? It seems a bit much to me.

 I've never had them take more than 2 business days.

Two business days for what?  To clear a check/ship or ship once the status changes from "on hold" to "confirmed payment"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never had shipping time issues with them, though I don't have a big order history with Monarch.  My biggest gripe with them is their tiered shipping raping structure. I mean pricing structure. The more you buy, the more $ you pay in shipping, yet they use the same priority mail/flat rate box.  In other words, you may pay $20 shipping and get the same flat rate box a $450 order would come in. You've just paid 2x as much for shipping.

Provident has the "worst" shipping times, from my experience.  I always pay by check, so I get hit with the literal week of clearing time for that.  Then, after that clearing week, the order switches to "confirmed payment" where it can take another 2-3 days to actually ship out.

Another thing to note is my last order with them, my check actually posted/cleared my bank the day the check was received at Provident. This is according to tracking delivery date and the post date on my check via online banking.  Same friggin' day Provident receives my check, the $ is taken from my bank. Which, in this day and age, is really how it should be, yet clearing time seems stuck in decades past. </TEXT>

Playing around with various counts:

* $544.85 for 20 @ Gainesville, this is with my rapey quoted USPS shipping of $19.45!
* $585.00 for 20 @ APMEX with free shipping

If you're looking for this coin, might want to take a look at Gainesville.

* They need to move inventory, that's the business they're in.
* They have sales, this part of the prior bullet point.
* You don't know what they paid for it.
* It may be a loss leader, i.e., it gets people to their site (new/recurring) where they buy other shit that has a bigger profit margin.
* Their sales have no effect on spot price, they would have to move massive amounts onto the market to have any impact on spot price.
* They are no doubt massively hedged. Spot could go down, sales could go down, but they could conceivable make more $ because they're hedged (they make the $ up elsewhere).
* APMEX has more Illuminati reptilians in shipping/receiving than in management. There is no conspiracy here until The Super Blood Moon Shemitah happens this September 23rd, thus the sign of Gozer's coming. WAKE UP!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> They do not.

Sometimes price differences between the two sites are negligible (even with shipping charge), sometimes they're quite surprising. I usually load up carts between those two with the same items and then start whittling them down based on respective prices. Well, actually I do that across all my regular vendors. Instead of one order with one vendor I can end up with 2 or 3 separate orders with 2 or 3 separate vendors.  There is $ to be saved this way.

As always, you should do some price comparison before ordering.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  a long-time client that has always been of the opinion that stock art available with a legal theme is boring

Bears are very smart and have been known to roll rocks into bear traps to set off the trap and eat the bait in safety. Smart like the legal team at Dewey Cheatum   Howe, LLP.

Canoeists have to keep their centre of mass low, so they dont capsize the canoe. Same strategy can be applied to tort law.

I wonder if UPS is their exclusive carrier now. That would definitely be a show stopper for me as saving $20 on an order isn't worth the inconvenience of UPS. I doubt I'd ever save enough to make it worth my while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing you need to keep in mind is the percentage change in silver to the percentage change in gold (per metric ton squared), when the latter has a causal influence on the former.

Think of silver spot price given in terms of differential calculus. In other words, it is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another, causative variable (silver to gold). Silver has the advantage of being a unitless ratio (excluding the troy ounce), independent of the type of quantities being varied. 

In empirical work regarding silver forecasting, you'll find the lows are the estimated coefficient in a linear regression equation where both the dependent variable and the independent variable are in natural logs.

You also need to factor in the percentage change in silver output induced by a percent change in silver input. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's the easiest way to file my federal and state taxes online? H R Block seems to have best reviews </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-23 22:38:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have pretty simple taxes:

* W2 wages
* Mortgage insurance
* 1099 misc income (from interest)
* No Obamacare
* No kids or any other deductions - as I said, pretty simple taxes

I've been going to a local guy for years but I'd like to save some $ and do them myself. He charges me around $100.

TurboTax and H R Block look to be the big players out there.  From my limited research, H R Block seems to get better reviews.  It looks like their Deluxe + State would be the best for me.

Some questions I have for those who have filed your own taxes online:

* Do I need to get electronic copies of my W2, mortgage insurance and 1099 that get sent along with my e-filing?
* If I need to print out forms, does something like H R Block Deluxe let you save those out to PDFs for printing? I don't have a printer at home so would want to be able to print it out at work. For example, if I have to pay state taxes, I don't want to pay to e-file that, I'd want to print out and mail my state return.

Any hidden gotchas I should be aware of?  I would have nothing to import from previous years, so this would be brand new tax filing for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never worked anyplace where IT didn't mandate your "choice" of gear. Most of the time there is no choice.

I've never been able to pick out what I want, so I don't want to get anything too crazy/expensive

Fuck that, go crazy.  I'm sure you have to, or will have to, deal with a lot of bullshit at work.  Might as well have a nice system. Remember, monitors are cheap, don't skimp on your computer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd contact APMEX and see what they say about how your orders were sent. 

http://www.apmex.com/faq

*How is my order shipped?
*American Precious Metals Exchange orders are shipped Registered/Insured U.S. Mail,   UPS. Each package is fully insured and may require a signature upon delivery.*

The "may require a signature" is probably determined by your order amount, which they could verify.

You could also be seeing a bug on USPS' tracking display.  If APMEX confirms they were sent with signature confirmation, it sounds like you have a problem with your postal carrier. In which case you'd at least know where the breakdown occurred and where to go to get it resolved in the future. </TEXT>

Via https://www.usps.com/ship/insurance-extra-services.htm

*Signature Confirmation*
*Find out information about the date and time an item was delivered, or when a delivery attempt was made. Add security by requiring a signature.*

If it was sent signature confirmation and you didn't sign for it:

* Claim you didn't get it
* When they provide delivery information, ask them for your signature indicating you signed for it
* Get insurance $
* Send me 50% </TEXT>

Also, APMEX are Freemasons of the Holy Royal Arch of the national Supreme Council, which explains their recent ebay "deal". </TEXT>

<TEXT> **I would steer clear of goldmart.**  I've ordered from them once.  **Once**...I really think they sell what they don't have in stock (like Amagi), despite claiming they have it "in stock, ready to ship".  I also think they drop ship orders because when my order finally arrived, it was covered in multi-colored stamps.  [Imagine this, but literally covered in different colorful stamps](http://www.sandafayre.com/stockimages/26343163.jpg).  It really screamed unprofessional to me, but maybe that wouldn't bother anyone else.  I really wish I would have taken a picture of it to post whenever I share my goldmart experience.

Goldmart was the lowest price I found, but I will never do business with them again.

[Silver.com is 40 cents more per coin](http://www.silver.com/2015-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leafs/) and I can't recommend them enough.  They're the same folks as JM Bullion.  They're awesome. Silver.com is the cheapest I found doing some quick price comparisons. </TEXT>

One had what almost looked like a diagonal score line across the back.  I'll try to get some photos up tonight, though sadly my camera isn't the greatest.  They'll go off to the safe deposit box Monday so if I can't get good quality photos tonight, the photos ain't happening :(

They look fine to me, again, generics, don't really care!

[**Photos of by far the worst two**](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) and it sounds dumb, but they actually look worse in the photos than in person. Being generic as generic gets, doesn't bother me at all.  It's hard to photograph coins with my crappy camera....Subject matter is highly reflective, don't have the best lighting, camera macro isn't the greatest and the auto focus tends to do its own thing, sometimes half is in focus, half a little blurry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did an [ebay BIN on a tube of ASEs Friday eve](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2v1omp/if_you_love_ase_like_i_do/codqf7v).  Just got home from work Monday pm and there was a delivery attempt notification. This was literally coast-to-coast shipping as well. I wasn't expecting anything before like Wednesday, tracked the ebay shipping # to make sure it was the ASEs and the delivery attempt was indeed the ASEs.

I've only purchased from them 2x (both via ebay, both ASEs tube sales) and this purchase is absolutely bananas!

Bananas, I tell you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm an old Apple guy going back to Apple IIe and I switched to Windows several years ago.  I have no plans of going back. My last Mac was the big aluminum iMac, I've had TONS of Apple computers over the years, I still have my SE which still works and my original candy transparent colored iMac which still works. The latter is worth nothing resale wise, the former I keep because I'd like to eventually do something with it.

Mainly, I switched because I didn't like that I could only buy what Apple wanted to sell me. At a premium price. With a PC, I can build/expand anything I want for less $. There's tremendous freedom in that. Also, I've never had a problem with Windoze. My first personal PC had Windows XP on it and I still think it was a decent OS. Still have that PC as well.  Used Vista for 2 years at a past job, didn't understand all the hate it got.

I don't miss anything. Really...I think you should give it a try. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Coin Analyst: Collectors Crying Over Milk-Spotted American Silver Eagles </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-31 06:13:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/ngc/coin-analyst-collectors-crying-milk-spotted-american-silver-eagles/

*Coin forums are loaded with theories from seasoned experts in the field. Many trace the cause of these tiny white spots to a wash the U.S. Mint is using. Specifically, the culprit appears to be detergent residue that isnt rinsed off before the .999-silver planchets hit the annealing furnace. As the cleaned silver planchets get heated to scorching temperatures exceeding 1,000F, any leftover detergent solution is inadvertently baked into the surface of the coin. The woeful chemical reaction between the baked-in detergent and the coins metal may take weeks, months or even years to surface.*

*As PCGS points out, milk spots indeed trace their origin back to manufacturing issues at the U.S. Mint. As much was affirmed by U.S. Mint Quality Division Chief Stacy Kelley-Scherer, who, in 2012, remarked that the white spots on American Silver Eagles are attributed to minting procedures. Unfortunately, Kelly-Scherer went on the record as saying that the U.S. Mint has not been able to find a panacea for preventing milk spots.*

*The Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) owes the milk spots on its coins to the planchet cleaning and preparation process...In short, RCM officials say they cant do anything about the spots* </TEXT>

Additionally, these STUN requests are made outside of the normal XMLHttpRequest procedure, so they are not visible in the developer console or able to be blocked by plugins such as AdBlockPlus or Ghostery. This makes these types of requests available for online tracking if an advertiser sets up a STUN server with a wildcard domain.

<TEXT> I noticed this new payment feature on JM Bullion's checkout page recently and just received this email from them:

*We wanted to inform you that your customer account at JMBullion.com has been approved for eCheck payments. To place an order via eCheck, simply log into your account, add products to your cart as usual, and select the new eCheck payment method.*

*On the checkout page, you will input your checking (not saving) account routing and account number, and we will use those details to generate an electronic check for settlement of funds. Funds will transfer from your checking account to ours, and from there, your order will ship out after a 5 business day clearing period.*

*We are happy to announce that eCheck payments will qualify for the full cash pricing discount, allowing our customers to lock in the lowest pricing anywhere while using a simple, safe, and convenient digital payment method.*

So if you're like me (and I know I am), you always go for the cheapest/cash discount when buying online. JM Bullion now makes it easier than ever to get this discount.

Note: I don't see this on silver.com (yet), which I hope they add. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Silver output from mines will total 867.7 million ounces this year, according to the Silver Institute. About 30 percent comes from primary operations, while the rest is produced as a by-product from mining metals such as copper, lead and zinc. About 50 percent of primary silver mines dont make a profit at $19 an ounce, $2.50 more than the current price, according to Brown.*

<TEXT> Picked up SOD for $5 (I think it was) over the Steam holiday sales blitz.  Pretty cool, but I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've basically made my way to the first home base (from the Ranger Station to the Church) and I've been free-roaming/looting the nearby buildings trying to figure things out. I'm not venturing out that far, I've hardly explored the map at all at this point.

I've built a couple things at the home base (an outdoor sleeping tent area and some sort of workbench) but I'm not sure how, or if I can even use them.  I think I'm supposed to reenforce the walls or something as well but not really sure.

I seem to be getting called out on a lot of stupid morale/fear missions where you have to talk to someone in your home base and then you just go outside and kill some zeds.  That was OK the first couple times but it sure seems to be a repetitive theme for me.

I've gone on a small number of missions.

I've lost 2 characters.

What are some pro tips/advice you wish you knew when you were just starting out? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,

Wondering what's out there in terms of a portable indoor heat source if the power goes out in the winter? Something that could heat a bedroom would be sufficient.

For those who can't light a fire, how are you preparing for winter storms taking out your power for a day or two or more.

A portable generator isn't really an option for me, either.

What is out there in the marketplace? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-11-13 16:36:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was pricing an item out last night and was surprised to find Gainesville Coins credit card price not too bad.  Shipping, however, was quoted at $26 via USPS which I find quite rapey, to be honest. UPS Ground was quoted at $30 and I would have to pay for the privilege to go pick it up on my own time/dime (over 40 miles trip), so that's a no go for me.

Anyone know how they ship via USPS?  Is my order going to be put into a flat rate box? Typical 3 day delivery cross country?  I don't think I've ever paid more than $14.95 for shipping from any other vendor and that was for larger orders.

I've never purchased from them before as they don't take personal checks and I'm all about getting cash discounts. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Posting for a friend because he's new to reddit and doesn't have enough karma to get his questions listed here...I'm acting as a proxy here.

[What do you guys think of this safe](http://portland.craigslist.org/yam/bfs/4733117842.html)? He's looking for a safe to store precious metals in, possibly up to $40k. He doesn't have the metal yet, he's just looking to get into metals for some diversification. Step 1 is getting a safe.

From his research, here are a couple links to the current model # (SB02):

* [http://beseenontheinternet.com/vasafeandlock/centurion_sb02.htm](http://beseenontheinternet.com/vasafeandlock/centurion_sb02.htm)
* [http://easternsecuritysafe.com/Products/homesafes/liberty.htm](http://easternsecuritysafe.com/Products/homesafes/liberty.htm)

Additional info he gathered from the seller:

*from the back plate  MDL# CNSB02.   There is a plate inside the door that reads: passed 2hr, 1000degree, heat endurance test, drop test   reheating test   gives the test standards #. I couldn't find a weight tag but I have moved it once-my best guess is about 250# -300#.  It is a great safe I bought new in 1995 or 96 to keep papers, etc, in.*

Neither of us are terribly knowledgeable about safes and what would be a good one for his needs so I'm wondering what you experts think of this one.  We both look on craigslist regularly but pickings (for what we think he needs) seems pretty slim. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are you looking for a tube to hold 20 (mint roll) Perth Lunar Series II coins? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-24 03:49:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [I recently ordered 20 Perth Lunar II Series but they didn't come in the mint roll](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2jmme3/would_this_bother_anyone_else/). If you ever find yourself in this situation (and you're annoyed by the stacking inconvenience), or you just want to tube up some loose Lunars you might have, this thread is for you.

What you're looking for are **"I" Cap-Tube Holders**. The Lunar capsules are a little loose in these tubes, but it isn't bad or annoying, IMO. It's certainly more convenient for me to have them tubed than loose coins.

You can [fit 15 Lunars right up to the rim of the tube](http://i.imgur.com/gQJuAUW.jpg). With the cap on, it seals fine. 

You can also easily [cut the tubes down so you can store 10 in a tube](http://i.imgur.com/EUjj3eJ.jpg).

I picked these tubes up on ebay from the seller **onfireguy**, I'm not sure if ebay links are allowed here but you can just do a google search for "onfireguy ebay" and it'll come up as the #1 result. Ships out very fast.

<TEXT> [The 1 oz series on APMEX](http://www.apmex.com/category/14500/gold-lunar-series-1-1996-2007/all?f_productoz=1+oz page=1)

* Horse @ $1,538.90 mintage 30k
* Snake @ $1,363.90 mintage 30k

The rest have lower mintages so I can understand the fluctuation in prices there.

I've also noticed this [Series II Snake for $1314 over at Bullion Exchanges](http://bullionexchanges.com/2013-1-oz-gold-lunar-year-of-the-snake-perth-mint-series-ii-coin-in-capsule.html). Great deal as it's [$1414 at APMEX](http://www.apmex.com/product/71321/2013-1-oz-gold-lunar-year-of-the-snake-bu-series-ii).

<TITLE> Email from Provident's CEO re: shipping delay on RCM 10 oz bars </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-08 00:37:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *Thanks for your recent order and your interest in Provident Metals.  We do sincerely appreciate the trust you've shown in us by ordering some precious metals from us.*

*I just wanted to reach out to you in regards to your recent order of RCM 10 ounce silver bars.  We were supposed to receive a delivery of these bars from the Royal Canadian Mint on September 29th.  Then the date changed to October 2nd.  And then to October 6th.  And then October 7th.  And finally, it looks like they're going to be here tomorrow.  In any case, once they arrive, we will stop everything else we're doing and we will ship out the 10 ounce RCM bars.  As an apology for this unforeseen delay, I will personally include a half ounce of silver in your order and give you free shipping on your next order.  To use your free shipping offer, please call in to one of our traders when you place your order.*

*Again, my sincerest apologies for any inconvenience this has been to you.*

*Kindest regards,*
*Joe*

I honestly don't care about the 1/2 ounce of silver or free shipping (I really don't).  What I really care about is the explanation.

It would have been nicer if they sent it *before* I inquired about the shipping delay and of course it would have been even nicer if, when I inquired, I was told this instead of ["We have plenty in stock"](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2i93su/interesting_email_from_provident_regarding/). But I probably confused their customer service folks when I asked "Do you currently have the RCM 10 oz bar in stock? If not, when do you expect a new shipment?"

But hey, kudos to Joe Merrick, Provident's President/CEO for being upfront about the situation.

Can't wait for that magnet.

**Update** My order finally shipped out on 10-10. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interesting email from Provident regarding shipping delay (RCM 10 oz bar related) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-04 06:26:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From Provident's automated email that goes out with order status:

*Your order is in the queue to be picked and shipped. Nearly 90% of orders are shipped within 3 business days after confirmed payment and nearly 98% of orders are shipped within 5 business days.*

I rolled into that lucky 2% today (5 days past "confirmed payment") and inquired about when they think my order might ship out.  This response came in this evening:

*We apologize for the delay. You ordered a very popular RCM 10 oz. bar. We do not like seeing orders going beyond the 5 business days. I have put a free rush on your order, which will push your order to the front of the batch with the other orders that have a rush. We are doing our best to get these products out to you as quickly as possible.*

So it sounds like they don't have any RCM 10 oz bars in stock [even though they're advertised as being in stock](http://www.providentmetals.com/10-ounce-rcm-royal-canadian-mint-9999-silver-bar.html).

So if anyone has ordered any RCM 10 oz bars recently, you might be seeing a shipping delay from Provident.

Pretty disappointing, but on the bright side I'm sure they'll throw in a magnet with my order.

**Update:** When their email came in, I replied asking if they had the bars in stock.  This was their reply that came in last night:

*We have plenty in stock. We are shipping out orders in the order they were placed into confirmed payment. We expect your order to ship early next week going off of the number of orders in front of your order.*

I ordered two bars, still seems odd why there would be this big shipping delay if they have plenty in stock. I mean how long does it take to pick and pack an order from their warehouse? On the price dip I'm sure their orders are up and maybe that's coupled with staffing issues, who knows...Still seems a bit fishy to me.

I also love the fact they gave me a "free rush" which costs nothing. I mean, you can't buy a rush order.  Not free shipping (credit) for the next order, a "free rush" in the queue, lol. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trying to ID this American Security upright safe. Any ideas? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-25 21:57:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *Posting this for a friend, he's new to Reddit and doesn't have enough karma to get this posted here*

http://salem.craigslist.org/spo/4676467207.html

I'm looking at this safe which is somewhat local to me (about an hour away) and I'm trying to determine the make model number so I can do some online research. The point is to determine whether it's worth the trip to go look at beforehand, as it's "somewhat" local to me. If it were in the same town, I'd just go take a look.

When I asked the seller if he knew the make/model #, he replied with:

"The # on this safe is a sticker. It reads 702 in big bold numbers and 10247 in smaller font."

I don't seem to be having much luck via google.

Does anyone have any idea what make/model this might be? I was hoping for a serial # as I imagine if I called American Security with that, they would have a record of what type of safe. Seller can't seem to locate any other markings.

*These are the only other identifying photos he could get from the seller:*

*http://imgur.com/a/RXxgy*

*The safe is reportedly 15-20 years old.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm doing some window shopping at Scottsdale for a possible purchase on the dip.  I have a loaded up shopping cart and I'm in the checkout section now.

The payment method is either:

* Bank wire transfer
* ACH (electronic funds transfer)

I have the ACH selected but it isn't giving me any info for what that ACH info is for paying online.

I'm looking at a screen with my shipping address, payment method, order summary and a "submit order" button.  I don't really want to just blindly click the submit order button.

Has anyone gone through this?  How does the ACH option work through their shopping cart? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cuz I just received a shipping notification indicating UPS whereas every other order I've done has been via USPS.  It isn't like my order is really large, either, it would definitely fit in a medium flat rate USPS box.

I hate UPS deliveries, they are incredibly inconvenient for me to have to go pick those up.

**Update**: Tracking number shows delivery this Friday.  UPS.com shows the customer center isn't available for a Saturday pickup and they're only open for a pickup M-F until 6pm.  I can't make this time as the god damned customer center is over 20 miles away (one way). No way I'd make it in rush hour traffic. This means I have to take Friday off to sign for my package.  Thanks Provident.  So now every order I make through them I need to contact them beforehand to find out if they can ship USPS.  Looks like I'm done with Provident. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://www.apmex.com/product/81490/2014-1-oz-gold-canadian-howling-wolf-99999-fine

The howling wolf is the **first release** in the Royal Canadian Mint's new 'Call of the Wild' series. 

What do you all think of this -vs- a gold eagle/buffalo/maple/krug/et al? I'd like to get an ounce of gold by years end and I've been spying this.  Seems like there might be some increased premium/collector value over time compared to standard 1 oz coins?

I'm thinking start with this one and hopefully keep up with the other releases...A save the whales, collect the whole set thing. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From my regular vendor list, Provident has them. APMEX and Monarch have spotted ones, though Monarch doesn't have enough for a tube.  I figure if I'm going to get them (they have a higher premium) might as well spend a little more to get higher quality.  Anyone know of any other online vendors (that take personal checks) that have tubes of 2012 1 oz Canadian Moose? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not talking about new/mint-direct stuff. If you or I were to sell a couple 10 oz bars, a tube of generics or gov-backed coins, *whatever*, to APMEX, Provident, JM Bullion, Monarch, et al...What do they do to verify that silver before reselling it?

In other words, when you or I buy that "secondary market" silver, how do we know it's been vetted? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Spot price shenanigans at SD Bullion? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-19 16:24:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At the moment, spot is:

* $19.46 via [silverprice.org](http://www.silverprice.org) (this is the main site I use for spot price)
* $19.44 via http://www.monex.com/liveprices/

[SD Bullion](http://sdbullion.com/) is currently listing spot at $19.70 (and I've refreshed a couple times)?  It isn't like spot is spiking up over $19.50, either and I'm just seeing a delay in the price. 

Wassup with dat? Are vendors listing spot at spot + X? I noticed when I purchased from Monarch they seemed to always list spot around 4 cents over what I was seeing elsewhere.

Just so you know I'm not bullshitting, [here's a cropped down screenshot of two separate browsers, refreshed at 7:28am](http://i.imgur.com/puGOW4r.jpg) </TEXT>

* Was it difficult to sell?
* How many ounces did you sell?
* What in particular did you sell (i.e., generics, bars, gov-issued coins, etc)?
* What sold for the most?
* What sold for the least?
* Was any item refused (i.e., a 100 oz bar)?
* Where did you end up selling?

Curious what some real-world selling experiences were back around the recent peak. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Don't see mention of [SD Bullion](http://sdbullion.com/) much here, wanted to give them some praise.

My second order with them came in today, I ordered the [new 10 oz RCM bar](http://sdbullion.com/silver/silver-bars/weight-10-oz/10-oz-rcm-silver-bar-9999-fine-reeded-edge-serial-number) which they're selling for $214 right now.

Let me break down the time frame on the order:

* Placed my order the evening of July 24
* Mailed out **personal check** on July 25
* My cashed/processed check showed up in my online bank account on July 28th
* They sent my "order shipped" notification on August 1st
* Delivered on August 4th

This was advertised as a pre-order that would not ship before August 14th as well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need a tube to put my family of Koalas in </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-04 03:45:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking to order a full set of Koalas from APMEX tonight.  They look to run from 2007-2014 and all years look to be in stock.  Each Koala detail page indicates they're in capsules and have a diameter of 40.6 mm.

I'm assuming all the diameters listed are really the capsule's diameter?  I ask because I'm looking for a tube to put them in.

I don't really like [the tube APMEX has for sale that says it's fits 40 mm](http://www.apmex.com/product/15341/sure-safe-silver-coin-container) (though it doesn't say 40.6mm).

I like [the tube Provident has for sale](http://www.providentmetals.com/cap-tube-for-airtite-coin-holders.html) which says it fits 40.6 mm.

The Provident one should work out, yes? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A quick google search led me to http://realfavicongenerator.net which generates favicons/html code in the following sizes based on a file you upload.

    link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png"
    link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png"

    link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="60x60" href="/apple-touch-icon-60x60.png"
    link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="120x120" href="/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png"
    link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="76x76" href="/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png"
    link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png"
    link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-196x196.png" sizes="196x196"
    link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-160x160.png" sizes="160x160"
    link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-96x96.png" sizes="96x96"
    link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-16x16.png" sizes="16x16"
    link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-32x32.png" sizes="32x32"
    meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#da532c"
    meta name="msapplication-TileImage" content="/mstile-144x144.png"

Are you guys using this? If so, what size are you creating your master favicon file that you upload?  Not all the dimensions in the generated code are divisible by 16.  Should I just create the master favicon at 320x320 (which is divisible by 16)? The generator site says your file should be at least 260x260 (not evenly divisible by 16).

<DATE> 2014-07-27 19:46:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've 40k left on my mortgage, which I can pay off in one fell swoop. I've thought about doing this for a couple years now but I also think about my mortgage being "good debt", if that makes any sense.

My mortgage is my only debt. Not planning on selling/moving anytime soon.

I think my interest rate is 4.25%, perhaps 4.125%, can't remember which.

Any 40k payoff would not be all my cash savings.

I would then take the monthly mortgage payments I used to make and just put those into my various retirement accounts (probably just split the $ up into even monthly contributions).

Thoughts? Anyone gone down this path or a similar one? How did it work out?

<TEXT> I'm building a proof-of-concept app for a friend and I'm using YQL to scrape 3rd party website data/content.  YQL makes this so ridiculously easy I had it working literally in 10 minutes.

Started with two 3rd party domains and when I went to add another, it wasn't pulling in the content.  Looks like that content is populated dynamically, so when YQL goes to scrape it (via xpath), it doesn't return anything.

Does anyone know if you can do this with YQL?  I'd love to keep using it because, as I said, it was so ridiculously easy to flesh out a prototype.

Ideally, I want to bundle this up as a bookmarklet for my friend so it's ridiculously easy for him to use. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As it says on the tin, I'm looking to have my carpet cleaned.  I live west-side.

Can anyone recommend a kick ass company you've personally used, hopefully somewhat recently.  Also, how much square feet do you have and what did it end up costing you?  If you have stairs, did they charge extra for those?

Bad experiences are welcomed as well so I can make a note of those to avoid.

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Buy gold and silver coins (bgasc.com)](http://www.bgasc.com/category/90-percent-silver-coins)

* [Dimes for as little as $1 FV @ $16.27](http://www.bgasc.com/category/90-percent-silver-dimes-10c)
* Dime rolls (50 coins) in Roosevelts, Mercury, Barber
* [Quarters for as little as $1 FV @ $16.27](http://www.bgasc.com/category/90-percent-silver-quarters-25c)
* Quarter rolls (40 coins) in Washington, Standing Liberty, Barber
* [Half Dollar](http://www.bgasc.com/category/90-percent-silver-half-dollars-50c) Kennedy, Franklin, Walking Liberty. Individual prices seem a bit much, rolls of 20 are better.

I'd love to pick up some of what I don't have in junk silver:

* Mercury/Barber dimes
* Standing Liberty Quarters (though they're out of stock on readable dates at the moment)
* Half dollar walkers

Seems a great place to pick up low denominations in standard dimes/quarters as well.

<TEXT> Placed a small order with each back on 7/7/14.

Mailed out my **personal check** payments to each on 7/8/14 (Tuesday).

Silver.com attempted delivery was today, 7/16/14 (Wednesday).

Tracking on JM Bullion order indicates it will be delivered tomorrow (attempted delivery, anyways), 7/17/14 (Thursday).

I'll go pick both up this Saturday.

Pretty impressive for paying with personal check.

<TEXT> **[This is how I'm planning on documenting my silver purchases](http://i.imgur.com/S06myJH.jpg)**.  

Initially, I plan on doing it old-school style, i.e., a notebook I keep with my stack.  Basically I'm just going to document orders like the screenshot above and at the bottom of each page run a total of ounces and cost per page.

I was thinking of perhaps adding an **ordered** date and **spot** price columns. Not sure if I really care to track spot price as I can ballpark that via any generic purchases and the last two columns. Might be something to add, though.

I can average out my cost per ounce by month, quarter or year, which would probably be interesting to track over time.

I'd probably start a "sell" ledger when the time comes as well, document those there and adjust the purchase book accordingly.

What do you guys think?  What are you all doing?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> * [Great packing, arrived with no external damage](http://imgur.com/a/qVuvW). I think someone here recently had an Amagi order where a tube was cracked/damaged. I don't think this is an Amagi issue, but rather a USPS issue where their box got crushed a bit.
* 2 tubes 2014 ASE.
* 1 tube 2014 CML.
* Also in the order was a tube of Philharmonics, but [they couldn't fulfill those for me](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2a6yqu/received_a_call_from_amagi_earlier_today_re_my/). I was really disappointed in their online inventory system not being in sync with actual product.
* A refund check is supposedly on its way to me now.
* On a scale of 1-10, I give this transaction, sorry to say, a 6. 

It does bother me that you order something they say is in stock, lock in a price and then find out they can't fulfill it.  I was hoping they'd throw in a note saying my next order with them will have free shipping or throw some trivial bone at me, but that didn't happen.

Overall, no big deal, but it obviously leaves an impression.

Their customer service is very responsive, though, I worked with Jillian there.  Gotta say, she was great.

<TEXT> Via APMEX, **no signature required on the delivery????** That was very disappointing, is this the norm for APMEX? The order was for two 10oz Geiger Security Series bars, came to $453.20, is this below a $ threshold for signature?  Honestly, I think that's kind of bullshit...

Can't believe the size of the box these came in as when I opened it up, [I was a little surprised at the size of the bars](http://imgur.com/a/y1bi7). I thought they'd be a little bigger.

Solid APMEX experience except for the signature deal. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They can't fulfill my 2014 roll of Philharmonics on an order I placed on 6/22/14.

They offered to combine some years to fill the tube but when I order a full tube of year X, I want a full tube of year X (still sealed). They're apparently not getting restocked anytime soon, either. They also offered to exchange it for something else, but it isn't like I had time to go shopping while at work. Besides, I wanted those Phils.

They're sending me a refund, assuming it'll be in with the order, but I didn't confirm this.

Disappointed that their inventory system isn't quite so accurate as I was really looking forward to those Philharmonics.

Oh well, I'll pick them up somewhere else.

Anyhoo, I'll be sharing all my online ordering experiences, whether good, bad or ugly.  I encourage you guys to do the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My second silver purchase, 40 oz, really nice online buying/checkout process. 

My first order was with Amagi, really nice online buying/checkout process there as well.  I've actually been quite surprised and impressed with my two online purchasing experiences.  They're pretty slick and I wasn't really expecting that.

I'll do a follow up post when the order arrives to relay the full experience.  It'll be a couple weeks as I'm paying by check, but I'll definitely follow up.

Oh, BTW, SD Bullion has good prices (for what I shopped around for/compared/bought) and they're running a $8 shipping on any order right now. </TEXT>

$9 shipped for this one.  Weighs items up to 500 grams in 0.1 gram increments. One reviewer says it even has an ozt mode.

I don't plan on buying silver larger than 10 oz bars so in theory this scale fits the bill.

From an eventual resale perspective, who are the most recognized minters out there with the lowest premiums? From another thread where there was talk of generics:

"sunshine, OPM, Johnson Matthey, etc."

Went with cart 2a below.  When I went to actually place the order, they gave me two shipping options, one was $5 cheaper (USPS (Insured) - Priority Mail 2-Day Small Flat Rate Box) so I went with that. Total was $1,996.72.

I'll let you all know how the Amagi buying experience goes for me.

**Thank you for all your feedback**.

**Edit: See updated cart at the very bottom**

Would really love your opinions on this as a first silver purchase. I wanted to end up around $2,000 for this initial purchase.

Amagi Metals seems to have some pretty good prices and selection from what I saw out there.  **I would love your opinion on the prices below as well as Amagi in general (I do see it in the sidebar)**. 

For this initial purchase, I'll be doing a personal check. I don't mind a delay in processing/shipping, that's no big deal for me.

[I captured a screenshot of my cart](http://i.imgur.com/HeE2nOU.jpg) if the formatting above doesn't work well.

The shipping doesn't seem that bad to me. For some reason, I was expecting it to be more based on some things I've read here about people paying for shipping.  That price comes from their calculator as well, where you enter your state/zip. The shipping is:

* Priority Mail 2-Day Medium Flat Rate Box $13.70, USPS Insured.

<TITLE> Anyone using small'ish/light'ish safes to store metals at home? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-19 21:19:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking at getting into silver investing and I've been researching some safes for storage at home.  I have stairs and don't really want to maneuver possibly 200 lbs up that by myself (and eventually back down). Don't really want to store it in my garage, either, though that's not necessarily a deal-breaker, just not what I'd like ideally.

Can anyone recommend a smaller/lighter type of safe to store metals in at home.  Something you're perhaps using yourself and are happy with.  And most importantly, how many ounces you think it could hold.  I'm looking to do coins/small bars, not sure if I'd ever go larger than a 10oz bar, I'm more interested in the smaller pieces for reselling way down the road.

I'd like a safe I can continue to grow into for years and years and years, not something I'll outgrow in a couple years. And I know I can't predict my buying patterns, just trying to plan ahead for storage. From what I've seen in pictures, it seems like a 2 cu ft safe would fit the bill, but I don't really have any real storage perspective for metals. I've never owned a safe before.

The 2 cu ft safes tend to be around 150 lbs, the low 1.x cu ft safes tend to be around 70 lbs, which is much more ideal from a moving perspective, but not sure how soon I'd possibly outgrow that.

Again, I lack that personal metal-storing-in-a-safe perspective.  For those using safes, what size are you using and how many ounces do you think you can store?

Any model numbers are greatly welcomed for googling. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Noob thinking of investing in silver bullion, have some questions for you all </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-17 22:19:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm thinking of investing in some silver bullion as part of some diversification and have some dumb questions I'd appreciate any feedback on. Perhaps eventually add some other precious metals, but would just be starting with silver.

This is a local shop to me, http://www.ajpm.com/silver-bullion.html one thing I really like about them is they post the sell/buy prices so it's a little more illuminating from a financial aspect.

According to http://www.monex.com/prods/silver_chart.html silver is at 19.71 as I type this. That local shop has prices of (bull/sell prices and I'm doing some rounding for the difference):

* American Eagle 21.22/23.32 (difference of $2)
* Maple Leafs 20.22/22.82 (difference of $2.5)
* 1oz silver rounds 19.97/21.07 (difference of $1)
* 10oz silver bar 197.50/210.50 (difference of $13)

First off, are these buy/sell prices pretty normal from a percentage standpoint regardless of the spot price?  

Second, why would I want to buy anything other than 1oz silver rounds? With a $1 buy/sell difference (at least today), that seems like the obvious choice.

Again, total noob here, any input is appreciated. </TEXT>

Looks absolutely epic, there was [mention in another game play demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wNiiQpDPJE) video of 50 hours main story line, 50 hours open world.

Are the previous Witcher's worth picking up? I don't think I've heard of this series, though I'm not a big gamer. I'm a big fan of Skyrim, which this looks a lot like. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone with experience in patented mine claims? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking to buy some raw land and I've come across some for sale that has a patented mine claim.  My understanding is that means you own the mineral rights as well as the land.

I'm not so much interested in the mineral rights, though it'd be cool to have them.  I'm more interested in the land having timber and a year round creek as I want to pursue micro hydro.

From some googling, it looks like the claim is for surface gold.  It also looks to be abandoned. Also looks to be yearly maintenance fees for the claim in my state, around $150.

The property tax on the land (from the listing) seems higher than I would have thought, given it's location.  Is this because of the mine claim?

Anyone have any experience with patented mine claims and any thoughts and/or gotchas you can think of? </TEXT>

* [Latest 9x20 video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTxQwkW6OQs)
* [Sold for 45k](http://moleculetinyhomes.blogspot.com/) (photos also here)
* Should have built storage under the stairs, a lot of wasted space there
* Dig the big windows up top (for ventilation) and the ceiling fan
* Nice exposed beam ceiling, I've always liked those
* Excellent kitchen, though it should have a hood/vent fan over the stove/oven :(
* Awesome bathroom, though the sink doesn't seem that practical

Worth a look for you to steal some ideas. </TEXT>

Had these two emails come in last night, I've never had any phishing emails come in like this before.  Note the urls where all the links in the emails go (lower left of screenshots).

Also had an ebay email come in a re: a password reset (which I did along with paypal when the ebay hack story broke) less than 2 hours before the two paypal emails.  Kinda "fishy", but there are no links in the ebay email, so seems somewhat legit/harmless.  Funny thing is, when I go log into ebay, there is no password change email waiting for me in my inbox/messages.  There is a "password update"  at the very top utility nav but one would think they'd also send an internal email to user's inbox.

<TITLE> What are the best "old"/popular PC Steam games you can pick up for cheap nowadays? Active online game play is a big plus </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-18 17:49:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking for cheap PC steam games to check out so I seek out sage advice.

What are some of yesterday's/yesteryear's biggest titles available on steam that can be picked up for cheap nowadays? Really interested in the games you can play over a long period of time as I tend to focus on playing one game for months at a time.

I'm a big fan of the more adventure type of games but I'm not a huge gamer so I'm out of the loop as to what is out there.

Big bonus points for those more "epic" games, like Skyrim which you can play for literally months and months and months. I'm actually still playing it, lol.

Online play, with a somewhat active community would be awesome as well.  As an example, I played DayZ (pre-alpher) pretty much non-stop for easily a year.  That was a great game once the big bugs were resolved.  Still haven't picked up the alpher, wasn't that impressed with game play/streams.  May pick it up down the road, dunno.

I'm on PC/Windoze 7. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Easiest way to scrape a website and extract contents of a specific DOM node per url? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We're migrating one of our old/large websites into a CMS and I'm trying to find the easiest way to automatically scrape every page and extract the html of a constant DOM node.

For example, let's assume this standard page markup:

    div id="masthead"logo and masthead crap/div

    div id="leftnav"left nav items/div
    
    **I want to extract all the markup within this "content" div, all the div's child nodes**
    div id="content"
        h1page header/h1
        pbody copy/p
    /div
    **end of div I want to extract**

    div id="sidebar"promos 'n shit/div

    /div id="footer"almighty copyright/div

I want to be able to feed it a list of urls (which I don't think will be terribly hard to generate) and end up with separate .txt files with the extracted html.  So assuming I have the following urls:

* http://www.mydomain.com/index.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/contact.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/about/index.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/products/catalog.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/foo/bar/baz.html
* etc.

I would end up with the following .txt files:

* http://www.mydomain.com/index.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/contact.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/about/index.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/products/catalog.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/foo/bar/baz.txt
* etc.

The urls I feed it essentially become the names of text files for that 1-1 mapping thing. The contents of those .txt files would be the markup within the div id="content"/div for that file name/url.

What's the easiest way to automate something like this?  We have hundreds of files.

Node and PHP would be viable options for me.

<TITLE> What considerations in upgrading to a 4k monitor for PC gaming? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-10 17:40:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

**Edit: Great answers, guys, pretty much told me all I need to know. Thank you!**

First, if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to, please let me know where you think it should go.

I'm wondering what issues/considerations there are in upgrading to a 4k monitor for PC gaming.  Amazon has a [39" Seiki Digital for $500](http://www.amazon.com/Seiki-Digital-SE39UY04-39-Inch-Ultra/dp/B00DOPGO2G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1397142217 sr=8-1 keywords=seiki+39+4k).

I had a custom PC built just over 2 years ago, checked the invoice to see exactly what video card I have (which I would imagine would be the primary consideration?), which is:

* Sapphire Radeon HD6950 2G 100312-3SR

I can't say I have any performance complaints with the games I've played.

I'm not really a hardware guy, so I don't really know much about this kind of stuff. I had a local shop do the build and I think they did a great job with the specs and price.  Figured I'd post this question here as I'm sure there are tons of really knowledgeable folks who have possibly already gone down this road. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How are you guys doing automated testing (sample scenarios inside)? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-07 16:44:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's pretend we have the following scenario.

We have a widget, it could be any widget, but let's just say it's a zip code widget where the user enters their zip code and they're served up custom content based on that zip code. Within this widget they can edit their zip code or clear it.  They get some basic validation/feedback on input entry as well.  For example, an error message if they don't enter 5 digits (just think like really basic form validation).  The key to the widget here is it's interactive.

How would you guys go about unit testing this widget in the most automated fashion?

Now let's say we want test that widget in a more integrated/end-to-end manner.  So let's say you want to test firing up the site/app, enter a valid zip code, possibly check to see if the right content is displayed (assume there would be some hook in place for this, like a id that equals the zip entered), navigate somewhere else, maybe navigate again somewhere else.

How would you guys go about testing this flow in the most automated fashion?

Also assume the scenario is you're integrating testing after the site/app is built and launched.

What are you guys doing to ensure some semblance of code correctness as you maintain sites/apps? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is coming down the pipe for me and I'm sure our marketing department is going to have many "creative" ideas for how they want it to look.

I'm trying to gather some urls that have a google custom search integrated so I can check them out to see what sort of patterns tend to be in place.  This way I can share this info with marketing and in theory, the whole design/dev process should go smoothly?

If any of you guys have implemented a google custom search (the paid version, not the free version), I'd love it if you could share some urls.  And/or just your experience with integrating it into an existing custom site. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-03-23 16:03:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I commute on a train 2 hours every weekday and I read during the ride.  I just downloaded [White Noise Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmsoft.whitenoise.lite) but the audio shuts off when I switch to my reader app.

Basically I'm trying to drown out train environmental noise by listening to white noise.

What's the easiest way I can do this? I want my audio app (which may change in the future), when playing, to be minimized so as not to obscure my reading app.  Ideally, it's not a ton of taps/swipes to get everything open/playing, either.

Do I need a multitasking app?  If so, any recommendations?

I'm running Android 4.4.2

**Edit**: Just coming back to say that [Chroma Doze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pmarks.chromadoze) fits the bill quite nicely. </TEXT>

These were the first guys I saw that did a fold up porch.  Might have been the first I've seen that actually did stairs as well.

* "Escape hatch" fire escape.  Surprised I don't see more of these, I think this is the first one I've seen.  Seems like escape windows would be more prevalent?
* Nice staircase storage
* Nice loft headroom
* Cool opening skylight </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a huge gamer here so I'm calling on your expertise.  Skyrim is absolutely gorgeous, it still blows my mind how beautiful the scenery is.  I find myself walking instead of fast traveling between destinations simply due to the scenery.

Also, the free roam/discovery aspect is amazing as well.

Lastly, you start talking to people and before you know it, you have 10 quests/tasks queued up.

It's absolutely epic and I'm looking for other games in the same vein.

Available on Steam would be ideal.

PC here.

Whatcha got for me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remember how the geolocation override used to be right under Chrome Dev Tool's gear icon overrides section?  I don't know when it moved, but it moved. Took me about 15 minutes to find where it moved to.  It's now in an emulation tab in the "drawer".  Here's how to find it.

http://i.imgur.com/ek2OYkr.jpg

* Go to the settings/gear icon "Overrides" section
* Click/enable the "Show Emulation view in console drawer"
* To open/close this drawer you can click the = icon next to the gear icon or hit the Esc key
* Go to the "Sensors" section of the "Emulation" tab
* Happy geolocating </TEXT>

The rate quote I'm getting online is $20/month + 2.2 per mile. Currently paying Nationwide $85 month.

Has anyone signed up with MetroMile? Did you find the rate quote accurate? Any hidden gotchas? Have you had to file a claim? If so, how did that go? What are your overall thoughts on switching to them?

<TITLE> Advice on interior painting colors and carpet -vs- laminate/pergo flooring </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-18 06:32:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello realtors!

I'm looking to do some interior work on my condo (built in 2000) and would like some opinions from a realtor/selling point-of-view.

I have the original interior paint (white and off-white/eggshell) and original carpet (still in good shape, but showing some wear) but I'm wanting to repaint the interior and either put in new carpet or some type of laminate flooring (that looks like hardwood).  I have pergo in my kitchen and just love the low maintenance and looks.

What are your thoughts on color schemes for interior paint?  If you have any photographic examples of more safe color schemes you'd recommend, that'd be awesome.  What I mean by "safe" color schemes are those from a selling point-of-view.  I don't want to have to repaint when it comes time to sell (which is not in the immediate future).

What are your thoughts on doing some type of laminate -vs- just re-carpeting everything? I'm thinking of laminate everywhere except the bedroom, which I would re-carpet.

Any and all input is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>
