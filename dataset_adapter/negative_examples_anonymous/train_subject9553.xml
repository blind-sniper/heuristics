<TEXT> They don't owe the IMF $242 billion like your title suggests. 

Greece accepted a loan of 30 billion Euros in 2010 and have been paying it back slowly ever since.

While they did use that 30 billion loan to bail out their banks, Greece still doesn't owe the IMF 242 billion Euros. 

242 billion euros is what Greece owes to all of its creditors, Germany, Spain, the IMF, etc. etc. ... 

I still think its fucked up that they had to take out an IMF loan at a usurious interest rate just to bail out the very banks that were engaging in criminal activity. 

However, this title is still misleading. The original title doesn't even mention the IMF, but it does mention the 242 billion Euro figure, incorrectly suggesting that Greece owes 242 billion to the IMF, which simply isn't true. 

If I left your post up unchecked, without the Misleading Title flair, it would've made the whole sub look bad.  </TEXT>

At least now we have a governor in Tom Wolf who has said repeatedly that he would sign a medical cannabis bill if one made it to his desk. Our old governor Tom Corbett has said in the past on numerous occasions that he would veto any sort of cannabis bill presented in front of him, be it recreational or medicinal, that guy was a real dick.  </TEXT>

Even though /r/technology and /r/politics have 5 million and 3 million subscribers respectively, they aren't default subs. 

Which means that any stories in these subs will only preach to the converted. The users of /r/technology, /r/politics and /r/conspiracy are already aware of the perils of this trade deal.

<TEXT> Yea but I think that the British have been by far the worst. The scope of colonial suffrage caused by the British remains to be matched. 

Also the fact that the British Empire is chiefly responsible for the creation of the 3rd world and the developing world. 

Before the British conquered India, much of Africa and the Middle East, the poor arpund the world enjoyed similar living standards. 

After England created their colonial empire, the poor and middle class in England had much higher living standards than British colonial subjects. Effectively creating a 3rd world in India, Africa and the Middle East. 

To understand the modern world, you have to know the history of the British Empire.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you ever read *Late Victorian Holocausts* by Mike Davis it details how the British were responsible for several famines in India over the course of a century and a half. 

The British pretty much shipped the vast majority of India's grain and wheat to be inserted into European markets, it was a manufactured shortage. 

Just look at the Bengal Famine in 1943, 7 million Bengalis died of starvation, during that same period the majority of Bengali crops were being used to help fight the British war effort in World War II. 

Google *Late Victorian Holocausts*, its one of the best books I've ever read. 

Our history of the British Empire has been completely whitewashed. All of the famines and atrocities that occurred during British rule, especially in India, have been effectively swept under the rug and we are left with a rosy, Downtown Abbey-like view of the British Empire. 

The British Empire was a horrible, exploitative, militant, racist, murderous society. We shouldn't forget the many atrocities committed by the Empire, in its quest for global domination.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've said it here before and I'll say it again, James Corbett is the antidote to Alex Jones. 

Furthermore, IMHO he was our best AMA guest, the man recorded video responses to questions, *video responses*. 

He's an indispensable source of information and what I would consider to be the best alternative news source ever. He provides citations and always maintains a certain professorial presence, even when discussing atrocities. 

I really can't say enough good things about James Corbett. If you like his work, you should see his documentary, its called *Century of Enslavement: The Federal Reserve*.

<TEXT> Blame Gandhi, in 200 years of British colonialism and direct imperialism the subcontinent remained united. In one fell swoop Gandhi, Nehru and Churchill come to the genius conclusion that India needs to partition Punjab to create an Islamic state to stop religious violence (*that sure worked like a charm*) between Hindus and Muslims.  

[The Punjab region, the land of 5 rivers, is 137,000 square miles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_region) 

[Compare that to the modern Indian state of Punjab which is just 19,000 square miles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India)

It seems like Gandhi, Nehru and Muslim leadership in India reached a mutual conclusion to screw over the smallest minority in India, the Sikhs. They gutted Punjab, 19,000 square miles is nothing, to this day we have to share a state capitol with Haryana, in Chandigarh.  </TEXT>

When I responded by saying that their censorship of my submission was the implementation of an agenda on their part I was banned instantly. I tried appealing but with little success. It seems like they have a narrative there that they don't wish to see disproved and that agenda would appear to be:

<TEXT> ThinkProgress must changed the title of the article at some point today after I submitted it to /r/politics. When I submitted the article, the title *was*,  "*Private Prison Corporations Spent $11 Million to Lobby For More Aggresive Immigration Policies*"

Do you think you still have to leave it removed ? Is it possible for you to leave the submission up and flair it something to the effect of "Title changed" ?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great article. 

NBC News is such an utter shit show.

This completely dwarfs the Brian Williams scandal. Richard Engel is complicit in implicating the Assad regime and the Iranian government in his kidnapping during a time where US intervention in Syria was being debated in Congress. Engel absolutely knew that this would sway the American public in favor of intervening in Syria on behalf of the "moderate" rebels.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The report prompted a massive manhunt and topped the evening newscasts, even as a global nuclear deal with Israel's archenemy Iran was being announced."

They are attempting to keep their own citizens fearful of Arabs/Iranians/Palestinians. Elements within the Israeli defense department, most likely Mossad, don't want average Israelis to feel that bilateral progress was being made in the region with a treaty. This hoax topped the evening news in Israel, relegating the real story, the US treaty with Israel's nemesis Iran, to minor coverage, prioritizing it to a lower status than it truly is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "It appears Velentzas eventually became suspicious of the undercover agent's identity, allegedly using her phone in November and December to access webpages with titles like "Learning the Identity of a Confidential Informant," "How to Spot Undercover Police," "Is S/he an Informant?" She also researched how to detect bugs.

Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. "I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint," she allegedly said. "Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot," the undercover agent responded."

<TEXT> This title is misleading. If Saudi forces continue to bomb the Houthi rebels in Yemen, then *Houthi rebels* and not the Yemeni government, will launch a ground offensive against Saudi Arabia. For one thing, Yemen's ousted governments are the ones asking for Saudi intervention, to say that Yemen is going to invade Saudi Arabia is misleading to say the least.

You can't equate Iran-backed Houthi rebels to the Yemeni government and military.  </TEXT>

Well when you are accusing someone of something they are not or take issue with being labelled as, you are attacking them.

There were statistically significant upticks in Israeli military action in the West Bank and Gaza Strip before big holidays or sporting events, but not before things that the Israeli military could not anticipate.


"In the days following 9/11 of 2001, when the rest of the world was transfixed by the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the Israeli government under Ariel Sharon seized the chance to send tanks into the West Bank, and attack helicopters into Gaza." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, while I agree with the sentiment of the submission and am not a Zionist apologist whatsoever, I think its wildly irresponsible; not to mention very misleading to make up fake quotes. 

I know Elizabeth Warren came out in support of Israel during the Operation Protective Edge last summer, I was very disappointed when that happened, I felt it exposed Elizabeth Warren as just another Zionist. 

However, she never said these words, and this meme submission is circlejerky to say the least. Find me a reputable source of her saying this and I'll retract my statement, until then I'm calling bullshit.

You can't just go around making up fake quotes for people you dislike or disagree with on global issues. If that were the case I could just put up a picture of Netanyahu saying how he'd like to wipe out all of the Palestinians and drink the blood of their children. 

Do you honestly think that a savvy, liberal politician like Warren is going to give such a ham handed, blunt statement like that ?  </TEXT>

I love it, Saudi's attack us, so lets deploy troops to Iraq, foolproof logic. Clint Eastwood linked Iraq to 9/11 with the way he set up that sequence in the film. Eastwood needs to stop making films, this film was a 2 hour celebration of jingoism and xenophobia. 

Did he at any point in the film have any of his characters say:

"Hey, why the fuck are we even here ? Weren't we attacked by Saudis ?"

No, he didn't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simple solution:

Don't enlist. 

Problem solved. 

At the very least don't enlist, go over there and wantonly commit atrocities just to come back and here throw your service in my face, I didn't ask you to enlist, so don't act like you did me a favor.

The worst thing returning veterans say to civilians that question the motives for the war they participated in is:

"I fought so that people like you could have freedom"

Or something childlike to that effect, completely oblivious to the fact that they are just mere pawns on some billionaire banker/industrialist's chessboard. The war in Iraq was NOT about defending our freedom, or about 9/11. It was about taking out a dictator whose policies no longer reflected the US's best interests. 

Saddam was going to start pricing his barrels of oil on the international market in Euros and not in dollars or petrodollars, which would've adversely effected the dollars status as the international reserve currency. That more than any other reason is why we went into Iraq. Don't delude yourself into thinking it was about protecting our freedom here at home. I certainly can't remember the last time an Iraqi tried to curtail my freedom, even the notion is ridiculous.  </TEXT>

I think starting a war on what was later proven to be manufactured, phony evidence and bombing a country back to the stone age would make the United States the savages in that situation. 

The US left a power vacuum for religious strife to take place, they created a platform for it. Then you have people like Chris Kyle blaming the victims of war for getting sucked up in a power vacuum that he helped create. The idiocy and ignorance looms large in that mans worldview. 

Furthermore you have the US army engaging in brutal torture on Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison, setting dogs on them and electrocuting the prisoners genitalia to get perverse pleasure. That's pretty savage if you ask me. Good luck justifying the atrocities committed by the occupying US army in Iraq, you have your work cut out for you.  </TEXT>

All this movie does is encourage young Americans to enlist in the military and continue an unending war overseas. It simplistically displays the complex reasons we went to war in Iraq. 

For instance, in the film they show the events of 9/11 and in the very next scene 18 months later, Chris Kyle is miraculously in Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. The film attempts to whitewash US history. </TEXT>

*Savage, despicable evil. That's what we were fighting in Iraq.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*

*But I wondered, how would I feel about killing someone? Now I know. Its no big deal.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper: Memorial Edition*

*Savage, despicable evil. Thats what we were fighting in Iraq. Thats why a lot of people, myself included, called the enemy savages. There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there. People ask me all the time, How many people have you killed? My standard response is, Does the answer make me less, or more, of a man? The number is not important to me. I only wish I had killed more. Not for bragging rights, but because I believe the world is a better place without savages out there taking American lives. Everyone I shot in Iraq was trying to harm Americans or Iraqis loyal to the new government.* 
 Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*

This is the hero that the American people are lionizing and holding up so high. This movie is pure propaganda and I refuse to be anyone's useful idiot and support this jingoistic, xenophobic film. 

He referred to people protecting their homeland from an occupying army as savages, I guess that would make the founding fathers and the soldiers who fought in the American revolution savages too then, right ? Wait no, those people were white so they can't be savages, they were patriotic, red blooded Americans.

Who do you think that 3 trillion is owed to ? 

The bulk of it is owed to a slew of defense contractors. Who do you think makes the bombs, tanks, fighter jets, ammo rounds and body bags ? General Electric and their ilk. War is business and business is a booming. 

Do you know who General Smedley Butler is ? He is one of the most decorated General/marines in US military history. He wrote a book in 1933 called *War is a Racket*, in which he atones for his past sins in the US military and admits that it was all for the United Fruit Company, Brown Brothers banking house and a few other major corporations. Here is a link to War is a Racket on YouTube:

As a Jewish person, Mr. Blumenthal is allowed to really critique the quagmire in the occupied territories without the fear of being labelled an anti-Semite. 

We should try to support his work, because he is really putting himself out there on the forefront of this debate with this book which I would consider to be his most important piece of writing. He gets called all types of things by the Zionist crowd, self-hating Jew, etc, etc. 

I think writers like him are the most important advocates for a Palestinian state, after all he grew up in a Jewish home and took the birthright trip to Israel so many young Jewish people take. He has an indispensable perspective on the situation in Israel and Palestine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They also haven't passed a resolution condemning India for warring with Pakistan in the Kashmir region. 

If Palestinians who are Muslim, haven't condemned India for the actions taken by India against Pakistan in Kashmir isn't that enough ? 

The fact that India is not a Muslim nation and they still haven't drawn any ire from Palestine, a Muslim nation on the Kashmir quagmire, is evidence enough of their appreciation of India.

Furthermore, what can Palestine do for India when they have Israel breathing down their neck, constantly encroaching on their own land and reducing life in Gaza to an open-air prison. If India would stay the course I'm certain the people of Palestine would reciprocate India's many good deeds if only they could. 

Israeli's are violating a slew of international agreements and UN mandates when they continue to violate Palestinian's human rights in the future Palestinian state. The parallels between what Palestinians are going through now and what Indians were going through under the British Raj are endless. 

Palestine first needs to be in a situation where they can pass some sort of mandate that would be substantive on the Kashmir quagmire. Right now, they are just getting by, surviving on what subsistence Israel allows them. In these troubled times for the Palestinian state, they are using their religion as a pillar to strengthen their resolve. Much like Gandhi and Bhagat Singh did in the face of British oppression. 

They shouldn't be punished for being Muslims, like many of the other Indians on this thread would like to do. The Palestinians are the unabashed victims in this situation and India is flip-flopping on their proud humanitarian history and turning their backs on the colonized to appease the powerful the Western countries (US   UK) that would like nothing more than to see Israel take over all of Palestine. That is what Modi's vision for India is, an appeaser of Western imperialism.  </TEXT>

India was once a shining beacon for shaming the rampant colonialism taking place in Palestine and the occupied territories. Modi is ruining that great legacy of humanitarianism.

<TEXT> Well we do pride ourselves here on being one of the last places on Reddit where things don't get censored and almost anything is allowed to get posted and gets a fair chance of getting upvoted. 

What I can do, as ineffective as it may seem on its face is propose moving no memes up the rule list a few slots, thereby stressing its importance. Right now its the 8th rule of /r/conspiracy but I don't see why it can't be higher up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We try not to remove anything once it reaches the top of the page, even memes. It leads to cries of censorship. Also content control is a slippery slope. 

I don't like seeing memes at the top of the page either, they never provide any new content and usually tend to lend themselves to circlejerking. 

The key is to get to memes before they fly up the page and accumulate hundreds of upvotes in a matter of an hour or two. 

If I see a good self post, I'll always suggest stickying it to other mods. Our sidebar picture right now links to a great self post by a user about trolls. 

If you submit a really good self post that you put a lot of time into and is of good quality, message the mods about it so it doesn't fall by the wayside. We'll always consider stickying a good self post.  </TEXT>

I'm sure that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that these countries want to control their own natural resources and the currency that values them. 

Just look at the countries the United States is currently beefing with, its the ones that aren't in debt to Anglo-American bankers, like Syria, Iran, North Korea. You can take Iraq and Libya off of that increasingly short list of truly sovereign nations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think they shove them down people's throats like they do here in America. I'm Indian, and the police in India don't have a slew of television shows and number one films made about them. As a matter of fact, the police in India are pretty much reviled, everyone is always going on about how hopelessly corrupt they are. 

I think the dozen new cop shows every fall is an explicitly American phenomenon. There's a difference between having novels about a detective, in Sherlock Holmes, and being inundated with procedural cop shows on television.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this in the comments section of the other submission about /r/documentaries and Monsanto so I'll just copy and paste it here:

I've had bad experiences with the mod team over at /r/documentaries.

For a few weeks I posted great documentaries there that regularly made it to the top of the page. I posted a documentary about Monsanto and it made it to the top of the page and the comments section got wiped out. The shills lost the PR battle in the comments section so the mods took it upon themselves to remove all of the comments.

The straw that broke the camels back was when I posted a documentary about Israel and Zionism and Palestine. It was removed and when I inquired to the mod team I was accused of having an agenda and attempting to use /r/documentaries as my personal soap box. When I countered by sayng that their censorship of my documentary was evidence of the mods of /r/documentaries having an agenda, I was banned. I never did attempt to appeal my ban. Why ? Cause fuck them that's why. /r/Documentaries is discredited in my eyes. You can post as many documentaries there as you want about Isis or Al-Qaeda, but not Israel. It upsets the narrative to much I suppose. </TEXT>

I even messaged them selected paragraphs from the article that demonstrated how this article dealt specifically with US politics and the IAC (Israeli American Committee) which is basically another AIPAC, and they still said that the article was "Off Topic". 

Pretty poor judgement, something tells me they didn't even read the parts of the article that I messaged them. They had their minds made up, regardless of what was in the article.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Content control is a slippery slope, I see plenty of things that I would like to remove, but that would lead to inevitable cries of censorship. What we like to do is let the users decide what should make it to the top of the page. If you want to do a good write up/self-post encouraging more users to visit the new submissions page then I would definitely present it to the other mods for a sticky nomination. I think you make several valid points here. 

If I had my way I would remove the majority of UFO/ancient alien submissions made to the sub, but I can't do that without alienating some of our userbase or being accused of being some sort of malicious government censorship agent, when in reality I just find UFO conspiracies to be childish and amateur. As a matter of fact I would even go as far as saying that some of those UFO video submissions are submitted here by the conspiratard crowd and brigaded to the top of the page to make us seem like a less serious sub, of course I have no way of proving that. 

But I digress, write up a good self post encouraging users to visit the new page more often and I'll nominate it to be stickied atop the page for a few days and if its agreed upon your sticky will go up and you'll see the quality of the front page go up drastically. That way front page submissions are better and the mods won't hear cries of censorship either.  </TEXT>

1. 2 guys in the Nebraska episode in Season 2

2. Shane in Season 2

3. Tomas at the prison in Season 3

4. A few (approximately 2 I think) of the governors people in Woodbury in Season 3 

5. Rick killed that member of the marauders in the house that he, Michonne and "Coral" were staying at, in the bathroom upstairs in Season 4.

6. At the end of Season 4 Rick killed the guy who tried to rape "Coral" and the guy he bit, so that one was a twofer. 

7. Rick began Season 5 putting up some numbers, he killed according to my estimations 4 people during the great escape from Terminus, remember he sneaked up behind them with an automatic rifle and took out their legs, leaving them to be killed by nearby walkers. 

8. Then Rick killed Gareth in the church because he made him a promise, and what good is a man who can't keep his word ? 

9. And of course this past episode started with a bang with Rick taking out that cop who wouldn't listen to him. 

So according to my estimations, that makes a grand total of 15 people that Rick has turned into walkers.  </TEXT>

These Indian "men" do a disservice to all other Indian men around the globe when they act like animals and prey upon young women. It doesn't make Indians around the world look good when their countrymen are behaving like ravenous rapists and molesters. 

It also screws with tourism in India, which as everyone here knows is a sizable chunk of the economy. You can't blame people from the West for not wanting to go India  on holiday if they are going to be concerned about the safety of the women accompanying them on the trip the whole time.

This submission is still on the front page of /r/conspiracy. Flairing it META does nothing to avoid vote brigading. /r/Conspiracy even changed their sidebar picture to one that is about this very submission. Its highly misleading to have it posted here like this as it suggests that the mods of /r/conspiracy (myself included) removed the submission in an act of overt censorship.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This picture makes me furious. 

This store owner is an Indian immigrant, he came here with nothing and tried to make something of himself. He doesn't have a dog in this fight, why are these rioters attempting to destroy his livelihood ? These convenience store owners don't even make that much money in the first place. My friends dad owns a convenience store just like this one and he's not exactly raking in the dough, this store owner probably makes most of his money from selling lottery tickets and tobacco products, just like the Swisher Sweets Michael Brown strong arm robbed from this very store.  So first he gets robbed by Michael Brown, then rioters and looters attempt to upend the way that he provides for his family in a vain attempt of misguided and misdirected anger. Their solution for police brutality is to rob someone who came here from a very poor country to earn a living, good job protesters /s.

2 weeks ago Jon Stewart spent the entire first segment of the Daily Show, making fun of the fact that Charlie Crist put a fan under his podium during the debate and that Florida Governor Rick Scott wouldn't debate him while the fan was there. This led to a 10 minute segment about dick jokes featuring the map of Florida.

John Oliver on the other hand will spend 15 minutes on one ACTUAL topic, and thoroughly discuss it, presenting both sides of the debate, as irrational as one side of the debate may be. Jon Stewart's bit is hackneyed and with Stephen Colbert leaving to host the Late Show next year, the path is clear for John Oliver to take over as the best current events/political comedy show on television.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was also record low voter turnout this year. We haven't had voter turnout this low since World War II. You can't complain about kicking all the bums out and simultaneously sit at home on election day. 

The underlying issue is that access to voting in America is not easily accessible. You have to increase the hours of voting, and place more polling stations in higher population density, low-income, urban neighborhoods to truly address the issue. I'll cite a purely anecdotal example, myself, I leave work at 5:30 and then have to take a train   a bus home, leaving me just 45 minutes to vote after I get home. I got it done, but I imagine if I had to wait in line, instead of simply walking into my suburban polling station.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Mr. Gage, my question is what you think of former Senator Bob Graham discussing the redacted 28 pages of material from the 9/11 Commission Report ? 

Former Senator Graham has stated that what is in those 28 redacted pages directly links Saudi Arabia to the 9/11 hijackers. If that is the case, do you think that a grassroots effort by your organization could place pressure on certain key elected officials to introduce more bipartisan legislation to get the 28 pages declassified ? 

In other words, could it really be that simple ? Now I'm aware how secretive the federal government is with their classified documents, like how there are still documents that relate to the Kennedy assassination that are classified. Do you think that the 28 classified pages could be the holy grail of the 9/11 truth movement ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is a great quote,  its the open secret that no sitting politician is allowed to utter. Scratch that, no important public figure is allowed to utter, anyone who has a voice out there that shines a light on this fact is immediately slandered, discredited and derided by the very machine they attempted to expose. Nixon was a dirty politician and he gets the entire force of the media brought down upon him. Whereas someone like Bush can steal an election, invade Iraq, create a decade-plus long clusterfuck in the Middle East, oversee an economic calamity and never seriois talk of impeachment. Its absolutely because someone like Bush is a staunch ally of Israel. Nixon illegally wiretaps a handful of politicians and he's the greatest enemy to freedom amd liberty to ever sit in the Oval Office, Bush amd Obama illegally wiretap the entire country via the NSA and those very same media establishments largely trip over themselves to defend and justify their actions, effectively pacifying the public. The level of hypocrisy is unbelievable.

<TEXT> Is it any coincidence the media then sought out to destroy and marginalize Nixon forcing him to resign. Think of all of the atrocities committed by other presidents before and after Nixon, the media didn't make it their sole purpose to force them out of office. Gee, I wonder why ? One of these things is not like the other. It is often said that the media destroying Nixon post-Watergate was the 1st demonstration of, "the power of the press", they sure aren't kidding about that. Was it really about Watergate, or was Watergate just a convenient excuse to get rid of the last president that wasn't completely subservient to them ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "outright left Gaza."

Maybe outright left a smoldering hole where Gaza used to be. You're delusional if you think that putting up blockade walls around the West Bank and Gaza is not annexing it. They have checkpoints for Palestinians to cross into Israel in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians can't even get simple building supplies and medicine through Israel's inhumane blockade, leaving the Palestinians to fester in an open-air prison. Israel is overseeing a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. So if they don't have boots on the ground there its okay, as long as they imprison and confine them it doesn't count as annexation, good fucking luck with that 1.

<TEXT> Here is the reply I received from u/anutensil about the removal of my submission:

"News about Israel   Palestine has always tended to overwhelm /r/worldnews, so guidelines were set in place years ago about what is considered major and what should be directed to /r/Israel or /r/Palestine, which were created, in part, to handle the overflow.

This particular story may become more significant in the future, but considering the context, it is not considered a major story at this time."

Make of that what you will. I don't know how much energy I have left to continue going to r/worldnews to keep on fighting the good fight. 

I was going to get into a long exchange with u/anutensil about this, but I just didn't feel like it today. [Also, what with the recent news on how Google News will now start including r/worldnews in their search results you have to expect that the likes of u/anutensil will be flipping the subjective censorship into overdrive. I knew as soon as I read about this, that it would even further negatively impact r/worldnews.](http://searchengineland.com/internets-front-page-reddit-now-worthy-google-news-205180)

R/worldnews used to be a place where you went to get the news stories that the mainstream media ignored, it is now a shell of its former self. All you get there now is the mainstream media echo chamber, its basically a sub dedicated to Russia/ISIS/Ebola-fear mongering. 

You certaintly won't hear anything critical of Israel there anymore, not after Google basically condoned r/worldnews selective censorship by putting them alongside the mainstream news outlets in their news search results. I'm certain the admins also congratulated the mods of r/worldnews on that recent revelation and probably told them to keep up the good work, or something to that effect. 

Furthermore, I don't think anyone should come down to hard on u/AssuredlyaThrowAway, he's the lowest mod on their totem pole, and to expect him to burn bridges in worldnews just to make a statement is childish. If you want to direct your ire somewhere, direct it to the mod that is responsible for this, u/anutensil. There's 26 mods on r/worldnews and he only has 1 account and 1 vote.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mods said it wasn't posted in the appropriate subreddit. This, a story about settlers from one country, burning down a mosque in a different country is considered to be, "Not Appropriate Subreddit". I took that to mean that any criticism of Israel is not appropriate for this subreddit. I really can't believe it. They removed it about an hour ago and I messaged them about it immediately, I still haven't heard back yet and I'm sure they are going to drag their feet on this, if not ignore my message entirely. With this strategy, they get to put off approving the submission until tomorrow morning when the submission will be, approximately 20 hours old and still be sitting at the same 870 upvotes that it garnered in just 9 hours. Thereby relegating it to no longer front page material, effectively censoring it out of visibility. The mods think they're so clever. That's what's going to end up happening to my front page submission about this subject. It was critical of Israel so its not appropriate for this supposed worldnews subreddit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got banned from r/documentaries for reposting this after it was initially removed. 

They definitely don't want criticism of Israel to become a regular thing over there. About a month ago, I got a documentary about AIPAC to be #1 on r/documentaries with over 1000 upvotes and more than 1000 comments. 

After I began inquiring to the mods about why my doc kept getting removed and why I was being hassled about reposting it, they accused me of having an agenda and not wanting anyone to use r/documentaries as a platform for anything in particular. 

When I asked if the fact that the submission was about Israel had anything to do with it being removed, I was derided for being a conspiracy theorist. Shortly thereafter I was banned. They accused me of having an agenda, when I countered and said it was in fact the mods that were removing documentaries critical of Israel and they were the ones with the agenda, I was banned. 

I messaged them 2 hours ago about my ban, and nothing yet. They responded to the rest of my messages pretty quickly, so we shall see ...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=eaf_1382262528)

This documentary is responsible for radically changing my worldview, more than any other film I've ever seen. 

I consider myself above all to be a history buff, conspiracy, trivia, popular culture, these things come after what I consider to be a very good grasp of history. When you find out that you have been lied to you, your entire life, about the events that occurred in World War II; you will feel completely betrayed/hoodwinked by US history or propaganda on the matter. The propaganda is so pervasive and saturating that you will not be able to get over the deception. There has never been a more 1-sided story told, than the story of Adolf Hitler. 

Also as an added caveat, this documentary has the rare distinction of being so controversial that it was censored by YouTube   Vimeo. 

This documentary answers so many questions, and it portrays Hitler as being more than your usual psychopathic, power-hungry, raving anti-Semite. 

If you really want to go down the rabbit hole, you have to watch this movie about the greatest conspiracy of all, the fact that our own history has been hijacked. The 'history' that we are taught in our compulsory state-mandated education is nothing more than Ally propaganda, amplified by 70 years of documentaries   Hollywood movies vilifying Hitler.

If you do decide to watch this documentary, just keep 2 very prescient quotes in mind beforehand:

He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past. 

 George Orwell, 1984

 

History is written by the victors.


 Winston Churchill

Also, take into account that in the 12 years of compulsory education that you receive in the US, you don't spend a single history lesson learning about World War II from a German perspective. In democratically electing Hitler, Germans are written off by Western historians as collectively being gripped by a national lunacy. My response to this method of 1-sided teaching of a subject as expansive is World War II is utter incredulity. How can you expect someone to know anything about a war, when they are only teaching 1-side of the issue ? 

After you watch this movie, it will become apparent that we are all the victims of rampant historical revision. Everything that Hitler accomplished in a short amount of time, like lifting tens of millions of Germans out of dire poverty, has been effectively revised out of all the history books. Now, even if you are taking a college level history course, all that is taught about Hitler is that he was a raving racist. Not that his Chancellorship oversaw the most astonishing economic recovery in the history of human civilization. The fact that Hitler began issuing government-sanctioned currency and went around the fiat currency, central banking system that he saw as parasitic; was revolutionary. 

The real reason the powers that be went after Hitler is because he sought to systemically change the banking system, he wanted to issue debt-free German currency from the central government. The powers behind international finance could not allow such a thing to occur as it would expose their parasitic, money as debt, fiat currency system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> YouTube and Vimeo have both removed this documentary. The only quasi-well knows website I know that hasn't censored this documentary, LiveLeak. Just the fact that Vimeo   YouTube wouldn't allow this documentary on there websites speaks volumes.  I know its 6 hours but once you start watching it, it really begins to fly by. 

Best, most mind-blowing documentary ever. 

All I can say to people considering watching this documentary is to prepare to change your worldview in its entirety. 

Also, before you watch this movie, ask yourself 1 question:

How come in the 12 years of compulsory education you receive in the US where you get World War 2   the Holocaust drilled in your head from the Allies perspective every single year, how come you don't spend a single history class studying World War 2 from the German perspective ? Why is the German interpretation of those events never taught in school, even for a single history lesson ?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea Afghanistan is also currently under military occupation by the United States, that is why its foreign aid levels are currently so high, whereas Israel's foreign aid is never going to go away. Afghanistan is getting foreign aid from the US in return for being occupied by tens of thousands of US soldiers, continually for the last 5 years. 

Remind me again, when was that long US-Israel war that the United States is still repaying Israel for ? Oh right, it never happened, so why the fuck are we giving them so much foreign aid ? 

Furthermore, the average Israeli gets more than $408.40 a year, per-capita from the US taxpayer, compare that to the average Afghan, who gets $423, per-capita from US taxpayers and has to put up with that pesky, US military to boot.

<TEXT> Yea right, sorry the Palestinians can't be as honorable as the Na'vi from Avatar. 

These people have been oppressed more than any other group of people on Earth and now they are being given grief for resorting to guerrilla tactics. 

The Palestinians are living under the an occupying regime, when you are under occupation you resort to tactics you otherwise wouldn't. Its as simple as that, use guerrilla tactics against a better funded, better equipped enemy with strong international backing, or perish. 

The Palestinians are resisting an occupying force, a practice as old as warfare itself. 

The Israeli's are wantonly wreaking havoc across the West Bank and Gaza to try to force the Palestinians out. All the Israeli's have wanted from the Palestinians from day 1 is the Palestinians land and for the Palestinians to then promptly fuck off. 

Just look at the most recent, brazen, theft of land in the West Bank. Netanyahu just got behind a podium 2 days ago and announced that Israel would be stealing 988 acres of Palestine. No reason in particular, just for the fuck of it. How can anyone just announce they are annexing almost 1000 acres of another country. 

Anywhere else on Earth what Israel just did would result in war with a neighboring country. Why should the Palestinians be held to a higher standard when they are literally watching their future country disappear around them, 1 illegal land seizure at a time.  </TEXT>

No sub bothers me as much as /r/wordnews. Its always the same recipe, remove all submissions about Israel that are climbing to the front page of r/worldnews, and when a post starts climbing to the front and the comments haven't been rigged in favor of Israel, just remove it for being "covered by other articles". I love it, covered by other articles, has to be the most bullshit reason to remove articles. 

if a Palestinian fires a rocket during a ceasefire its all over the front page of r/worldnews, multiple links at a time, but when Israel ends a ceasefire by annexing nearly a thousand acres, its nowhere to be found on r/worldnews.

<TEXT> This is Israeli hasbara, propaganda at its finest. [Here is a link about the program Israel has, where they pay college students to astroturf social media forums with pro-Israel propaganda and talking points.](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html)

All u/KVillage1 does on Reddit is defend Israel and their atrocities. Just casually peruse through his post history, almost every single comment is in defense of Israel. There is no nuance in his iterations, just Israeli propaganda. If Israel is in the right here, then why do they feel the need to pay Israeli college students to disseminate this sort of propaganda. [Here is another link on this incredibly dishonest and manipulative practice that Israel engages in by having paid propaganda agents on social media hubs like Facebook and Reddit.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/)

The Palestinians don't have paid PR agents to astroturf their talking points on Facebook all day, they are more worried about getting food, water and medicine into Gaza, past Israel's inhumane blockade. Instead all the Palestinians have is people like me, who can see past the media blitz and all of the Israeli internet propaganda to make this look like an even sided battle. It is not an even battle, 1 side has sophisticated, US funded technology, whereas the other is being kept in an open air prison, otherwise known as the Israeli blockade. 

How can these Israel apologists expect the Palestinians to be subjected to being held in the deplorable, sub-human conditions, that Israel has subjected the Palestinians people to. Israel are the conquerors, they are mostly European Jews, colonizing a Middle Eastern nation. How can you possibly expect the native people to not try to fight against an occupying force ?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just wish this story was getting more traction. U wanna hear something spooky ? So I went to post this article to r/worldnews and it, unsurprisingly had already been submitted. Here's the scary part, when I clicked on the username of the OP, u/drone499, it turns out they had been recently shadowbanned. 

Further cementing my theory that the most taboo subject on Reddit is pro-Israel astroturfing/Hasbara/JIDF. I accused someone on r/worldnews of being a pro-Israel shill about a month ago, and I was promptly reported as a spammer and had to spend the next 2 hours exchanging messages with the admins to prove I'm not a spam-bot or spammer. 

If there is 1 thing that is off-limits on Reddit it is Hasbara/JIDF. It's scary to think about how much influence these pro-Israel shills have on this website. They seem to operate with complete impunity. 

Here's the link to the submission to r/worldnews about this subject, then click on the users profile, this was most likely the last thing he ever submitted to Reddit.

<TEXT> Maybe if there wasn't an Israeli blockade stopping Gazans from being able to tend to their wounded this would've never happened.

Say what you want to about Hamas and their primitive rockets, Hamas are not the ones imposing a blockade on Israel and forcing them to live in an open air prison. Gazans can't even get medical supplies, water or food and they are the ones getting all the grief. 

Maybe these rocket attacks were retribution for Israel's blockade stopping someone in Gaza from saving the life of a loved one. 

If you want peace you have to end the blockade, take down the Great Apartheid Wall of Israel. No one has ever been able to strike a peace deal with an oppressed minority group by keeping them locked in an open air prison and rationing their calories.  </TEXT>

I hope they hit this piece of shit with hate-crime charges, the race of his victim was clearly foremost on the assailants mind during the attack. 

Seriously, fuck this guy. The last time I was called a sandnigger was when I was crossing the street, walking home from high school and this dude, completely unprovoked yells at me as I'm reaching the other side of the road:

"Fucking sandnigger !" 

Then he just drove off, I couldn't even believe it had happened I was like in shock. This piece of shit was like a middle-aged guy just driving around his pick up truck calling young, brown men sandniggers. This all went down in a suburb of Philadelphia, so not exactly the deep South, and we still have this kind of simple-minded racism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This post is such pro-war propaganda. OP should be ashamed of themselves for posting such a blatant example of what is clearly hasbara at work. This whole sub has completely changed. Hasbara agents have infiltrated this sub. I get my posts removed if they have a single of instance of opinion or analysis, but this just rockets up to the top of the page. Gee, I wonder why ? 

I have had both of my articles removed from r/worldnews today, supposedly because 1 was Opinion/Analysis, funny thing though is that it wasn't. My other submission was climbing near the top of r/worldnews and was critical of Israel, can't have that now can we mods ? They took it down and said it was covered by other articles. I asked them for an example of my article topic having been submitted and they haven't gotten back to me yet, go figure. This is blatant selective censorship of anything that isn't complete pro-Israeli war propaganda or hasbara as they refer to it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full text in case of paywall, although I didn't get 1:

Over the past two weeks, an increasing number of Facebook pages are reporting on people who express joy at the deaths of IDF soldiers or speak out harshly against the war effort, and calling for them to be dismissed from their jobs.

In some cases the efforts of these individuals have led to dismissals of people who came out against the IDF, or expressed happiness over harm to soldiers. For example, Hadassah College in Jerusalem withdrew a scholarship to an Arab woman student over a Facebook post. Hadassah College President Berthold Friedland wrote the student: We read your post with shock and disgust. Friedland also wrote that until clarifications are completed and the police deal with it, the college management has decided to prohibit you from entering the campus for any reason, academic or other.

Other educational institutions have issued warnings to their staff and students that they must avoid extremist and inappropriate statements on social media, and threatened disciplinary action or to go to the police.

Facebook pages of this type, such as Boycott Haters of Israel, Fifth Column in Israel have received between a few thousand to tens of thousands of Likes. In one case, the administrators of the Facebook page of the food chain Tiv Taam responded to a report on the Facebook page Concentration of Destroyers of Israel by saying that one of its employees, who had expressed happiness at the death of soldiers and Jews, had been fired.

Last week, the Lod municipality dismissed a psychological counsellor, Isra Gara of Jatt, after she expressed joy at the death of soldiers.

Shufer-Sol food chain reported on its own Facebook page that two employees had been summoned to a hearing before dismissal, due to reports the two had made what it deemed unacceptable comments, and warned that employees who did so would be fired.

The mobile phone company Cellcom also summoned an employee for clarifications following a number of reports about statements she had allegedly made.

Ben-Gurion University President Prof. Rivka Carmi wrote to students and staff that the university was following the discourse on the Web, and if need be would act according to the disciplinary code. Tel Aviv University also warned in a letter to faculty against hurtful and extremist statements by students or faculty. Thirty faculty members signed a letter of protest against the move. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hanzi, you fucker ! 

I knew exactly who you are.

I heard you on O A a while ago, I don't listen to Howard anymore on account of him sucking a fat one for a long time. I do however have an interesting theory to run past you. It's my Sirius/XM conspiracy. I'm sure you heard about Anthony Cumia getting the axe ? 

Well my theory for the reason Antony got fired is because he is the single loudest, most influential, pro-gun personality on Sirius/XM. On the other end of the spectrum you have a hypocrite like Howard Stern who is anti-gun but has a permit to carry in NYC, which is incredibly hard to acquire. If you call him on it he'll tell you:

"But I'm a celebrity, I need one to ensure my safety, you know cause I'm so famous. Ho hoo." 

Basically he's saying he can carry a gun because his safety is so vital to the community whereas us plebeians don't deserve them because we are the poor unwashed masses, our lives don't have as much inherent value as old Howard from the Hamptons. 

BTW: I admire your attempt at getting through to Opie and Anthony, but they're hopeless and Jim Norton too. They are conservative guys and they can't hear anything that would upset their worldview and America's role in it as a beacon of freedom or soaring eagle or something else they can get a freedom boner to. It made for good radio though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get that a lot of people are going to see this submission and think to themselves:

"He's a shock jock, who cares what the hell he thinks ?"

Stern has the most heard voice in the Western hemisphere, his own radio show opening theme song boasts about reaching more than 10 million listeners a day. He's in people's cars, in their headphones, he has an intimate relationship with his fans, in short he wields a tremendous amount of influence. Imagine if Jimmy Fallon went on the Tonight Show and went on a rant like Stern did about Israel, it would without question sway public opinion in favor of Israel.  </TEXT>

"As The Jerusalem Post reports, the effort to make Israels case is being spearheaded by 400 college students posting comments, memes, video clips, images and explanatory graphics on Facebook and Twitter from dozens of computers in a Hasbara war room at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. Hasbara, a Hebrew euphemism for propaganda, literally means explanation, and the organizers of the campaign promise to equip like-minded volunteers who visit their website, Israel Under Fire, with everything you need in order to properly inform about and advocate for Israel, in 19 languages." </TEXT>

Or:

The story isn't that she may or may not support Palestine, the story is that whatever forces are at work in Hollywood do not want celebrities to speak their minds on a perceived injustice. It amounts to blatant censorship and for better or worst, most of the time worst, society gets its social cues from celebrities and in this instance people like Rihanna and Dwight Howard from the Houston Rockets are not being allowed to air their grievances.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was literally the worst podcast I've ever heard. This guy is just an academic who sits back and talks shit about Muslims the whole time. Whoever heard of a Jewish guy complaining about Palestinians, so brave. This guy is a piece of shit shit, sitting there defending Netanyahu and his apartheid state in Israel. 

Hey Guy Saad, since you can't seem to figure out why the Palestinians are so incensed by the here's a little fucking cheat sheet for you. Maybe the reason the Palestinians have a grudge with you guys is because you took their land, forced them to live in hellish, permanently temporary refugee dwellings, leaving them perpetually stateless. 700,000 Palestinians were forced out in 1948 alone. 

Then he blames Muslims for all of the instability in the Middle East which is especially egregious because ever since Israel, the country Mr. Saad is unabashedly above criticism, was created in 1948, they have been the most disruptive force in the Middle East. 

Worst. Podcast. Ever.

<TEXT> Congratulations admins, you've irreparably damaged Reddit. I spend the majority of my time on small subs, and those subs are now completely open to being vote brigaded. I don't understand why in a million years the admins would take it upon themselves to make a change no one asked for that in fact makes vote brigading impossible to detect. Of course I do actually know why the admins did it, and it probably has something to do with this article from the Guardian that was published yesterday about Reddit making digital marketing campaigns easier for corporations, here's the link to it:

http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jun/18/integrate-reddit-digital-marketing

It's so blatantly obvious that this is a move to make Reddit more mainstream and corporate-friendly. This simple fact is this will kill the smaller subs, like r/guns, r/progressive, r/worldpolitics, r/conspiracy, r/documentaries and countless other subs. This is completely fucked, I can't even look at vote counts for my old posts from well before the implementation of this ridiculous rule. Reddit just opted for less transparency, to whose benefit ? Cause it's certainly for the users benefit, cui bono, Reddit, it's Latin for who benefits and that is the question we should be asking ourselves, who benefits from this ridiculous new rule. It's the government and corporations that benefit from this, Reddit is nothing more than a hollowed out shell of its old self, a PR agency that touts itself as the Front Page of the Internet, a bastion of democracy when in fact it just does PR for governments and corporations, a task they just got a lot better at. It's open season on every small, controversial sub, in terms of vote brigading, courtesy of the administrators.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was some straight up serial killer shit. 

No other way about it, it was murder, as plain as day. The guy was getting on the ground and everything and the 1 cop just unloaded on him for seemingly no reason.

Then his legs just barely twitched and they plugged him with 3 more rounds for it, simply disturbing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would be willing to do it. 

Also had I known that I would 1 day be throwing my name in as a contender for moderatorship of this, the sub that I created my Reddit account for, r/conspiracy, I would've spent more time coming up with a clever/incendiary username, but here we are. 

Here is a montage of my greatest hits on r/conspiracy : 

Why Reddit moderators are censoring Glenn Greenwalds latest bombshell

Michael Hastings Cremated Against Familys Wishes, Deepening Mystery Of Journalists Death

Autopsy finds Rolling Stone journalist's fatal car crash not due to drug use
http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ksrr8/autopsy_finds_rolling_stone_journalists_fatal_car/

IMHO however my greatest contribution and what are more telling of what I consider to be real conspiracies are what Reddit considers to be my most controversial submissions:

JIDF, once respected, now a platform for harassment, bullying   libel
http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1mvq55/jidf_once_respected_now_a_platform_for_harassment/

Is the Movement to Boycott Israel Working?
http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zjqlf/is_the_movement_to_boycott_israel_working/

Ukraine Protests Carefully Orchestrated: The Role of CANVAS, US-Financed Color Revolution Training Group
http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ynggh/ukraine_protests_carefully_orchestrated_the_role/

Now, because this a democratic system I plan on using some good old fashioned fascism and fear-mongering to rile up the free thinkers to get them in a frenzy and sweep into the cabal of power   influence that is moderator status on r/conspiracy /s. 

This sub is under attack, the content on this sub has taken a nose dive over the last 6 months and that decline in quality conspiracy-related content has been in direct correlation with the spike in subscribers to r/conspiracy. How is it that around the same time the Snowden leaks began this sub saw a sharp increase in traffic of the shill variety ? Could it be coincidence ? I don't think so, and in IMHO most of you would agree with me. This sub has clearly been hijacked by r/conspiratard and their merry band of vote brigadiers. To defend this sub I would :

Greatly reduce the amount of memes that get submitted to this sub, the memes that make it to the top of the page here over the past 6 months have at times been either what I would consider to be circlejerk material or it's been things that have been entirely antithetical to what this sub is supposed to be about, like the link I've provided as an example. (http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yzx2k/alan_moore/) 

I would also investigate/ban all suspected shills immediately after viewing their inane comment/submission. No one understands the frustration of witnessing your controversial yet somehow popular submission to r/conspiracy have it's comment section derailed by an endless cadre of suspected shills and their stupid jokes, like I do. 

If made moderator I would respond to any queries regarding the sub or my actions as moderator in a timely fashion, I've dealt with mods that are quick at removing your post and then slow at explaining why it was taken down, it can be frustrating. Over the course of an average day I am on Reddit on my work computer   personal laptop as well as being on the Reddit is Fun app on my smartphone   tablet while I'm out.

Thanks for reading all of this/considering giving me your vote.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Bipolarbear0 is without a doubt the biggest piece of shit I have ever encountered on the Internet, and I've been online since '96. I can't prove it but I'm certain he's the reason I got banned from r/news.  I complained about him removing all of my posts from r/news to the mods of r/news and the next time I posted an article to r/news (it was about the amount of attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians had increased 4-fold in 2013) I was promptly banned for posting opinion/analysis pieces. This cannot go on,  my ban was supposed to be for 1 month, 5 weeks later I was told that only the mod that banned me can unban me and the mods of r/news will mot reveal which specific mod it was, but I mean come on.  I couldn't post an article critical of Israel to r/news without it being removed for some reason or another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> R/news banned me for what was supposed to be a 1 month suspension but has since become a perpetual suspension,  without any notification or reason,  other than only the mod that banned you can unban you. This ban came suddenly after I complained about Bipolarbear0's censorship directly to the mods of r/news.  I complained about Bipolarbear0 to the mods of r/news and the next time I posted an article about Israel/Palestine I was banned for posting opinion/analysis pieces. Pretty fucked up, you can't complain about the mods without being banned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This post is complete bullshit.  How the fuck is this at the top of the page ? I see a lot of people complaining about the decline of this sub over the last few months but this post really underlines it. How the fuck can this guy liken a Jewish banking conspiracy to aliens or reptilians ? Its as if the Rothschild dynasty never occurred,  look at the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve for Christ's sake. This has to be the shittiest meme I've ever seen on here, and it's completely antithetical to what this sub stands for,  it completely disparages us Free Thinkers,  and yet there it is at the top of the page, mocking us. This post is above the 1 about Michael Hastings,  a real life conspiracy involving government assassination programs. I think this sub has been too badly compromised, its a shell of what it once was. Aliens, what nonsense.  I like my conspiracy theories how I like my data storage,  terrestrial,  fuck the cloud and fuck this meme.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe it, it's obscene how much clout Comcast has, I'm typing this from Center City Philadelphia, so I'm literally in the shadow of the Comcast Building/Comcast HQ. No one knows better than Philadelphians how badly Comcast fucks you every month, leaving you butthurt well into the next billing cycle. 

I pay $170/month for Internet, Cable and phone, and in return get the worst customer service ever and zero choice in subscribers. I've been talking about getting all of my entertainment from the internet for a long time but I haven't been able to effectively cut the cord. This merger has provided me the impetus to strike a symbolic blow against Comcast and sever the cord that has bound me to this monopolistic industry for far to long. 

What is so wrong about choice in a supposed free market ? What Comcast is doing is comparable to a corporation like Google, stopping Yahoo from allowing their service to be provided to entire regions, imagine that for a moment. Imagine if you lived in California you could choose between a Google or Yahoo search, but your friend in Seattle having to use Bing, because Bill Gates has got it like that in Washington state. 

TL?DR?
Fuck Comcast. They are the Rockefeller, Standard Oil of the 21st century.  </TEXT>

The way I see it, the Japanese and Chinese are driving all of Earth's most stunning and intelligent creatures to extinction; purely to satiate their own savage barbarism. There isn't anything racist about it, it's a fact. It used to be the Europeans, then it was briefly America and for the last 30 or 40 years China and Japan are providing the largest markets for endangered species.

<TEXT> Indian here, can confirm blatant racism from US military and the families of US military. It's not appreciated. Those idiots in the comedy club only condone that meat-head vet's behavior. Yes, I understand that the comedian and the vet made up afterwards and I'm sure they had a touching, interracial interaction that warms the heart. However, it does nothing for people that have had to deal with institutionalized racism coming from the US military and it being widely condoned throughout American culture. 

You could take the most liberal, white guy from California and if a US soldier was being racist to an Indian guy at a gas station calling him Osama or some of the other favorites, sandnigger or camel-jockey and the liberal white guy would go:

"HA HA HA ! FUCK THAT GUY ! RIGHT ? YEA ! 'MERICA !"

Just to appease some sort of societal expectation of patriotism. My generation is so brainwashed in this pro-war mindset, it's really sad. I was thinking about it this past weekend watching the pre-game military ritual's before kickoff in the NFL. The overt militarism, the blind loyalty. Also, not for nothing there are more than 1.3 billion Indian people on Earth, we literally comprise 1/6 of humans. So you come as pretty fucking ignorant when you just come out and accuse all brown people of  being terrorists. Again, yes I'm aware that the vet was joking, but just imagine if someone in the audience who was white made a similar joke about a black comedian with respect to lynching ? 

BTW, I welcome the downvotes, butthurt military members and family of military members. Don't take your overt hypocrisy in condoning racism against Indian people and blasting racism in any other situation, out on me.  </TEXT>

Here's some more links on Israel's Hasbara/JIDF propaganda program, and how it's used to manipulate American users of websites like Reddit:

<TEXT> JIDF, please go away, get a real job. Do an honest day's work instead of subverting online political discourse with your shilling and lies. A quick scroll through your post history shows all you do is post pro-Israel propaganda on behalf of the Israeli government. This blatant propaganda being plastered all over Reddit is sickening. Here are some links proving how Israel is using JIDF trolls like /u/GeneralMunro to manipulate Americans into thinking other Americans have strong pro-Israel views:

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-proisraeli-propaganda-8760142.html

Don't fall for these JIDF shills. /u/generalmunro is at work right now for the Israeli government or some Israeli special interest group, and if you fall for his propaganda you are being worked. I'm sure /u/rosinthebow will be along shortly to defend his JIDF brethren, him and a bunch of other JIDF, pro-Israel propaganda agents. They could all be the same person for all we know, logging in and out of different accounts, it's pretty messed up. No other country subjects another country's citizens to internet propaganda via shills and astroturfing the way that Israel manipulates Americans.  </TEXT>

Anyone who unduly accuses someone of antisemitism to stifle conversation, critical of Israel should be banned. It's such an obvious subversion of the 1st rule of /r/conspiracy. All of a sudden you go from discussing the plight of the Palestinian people, to defending your credibility as an objective interpreter of events is Israel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea they do it to their own countries population,  they don't get on popular US forums for political discourse online to manipulate US foreign policy. China and America use propaganda to pacify their own citizenry,  Israel uses propaganda on Americans to sway public opinion on nations in the Middle East unfriendly to Israel.  AIPAC for instance lobbied Congress to go to war in Iraq, because it fits into a larger Israeli plan to destabilize the region. There's a big difference,  Israel is and has been attempting to control US foreign policy in the Middle East since its creation. If Israel has such a problem with Iran then they should handle that situation themselves,  instead they want Americans to go to Iran to die,  and murder innocent Iranian people. Israel should fight their own wars, or simply STFU.  </TEXT>

I started my Reddit career on /r/conspiracy this past February and have since moved on to posting in the larger subs, only to be met with an incredibly organized downvote brigade immediately after each Israel/zionism related post goes up. I'll literally have my lone upvote and 2 or 3 downvotes In a matter of seconds, its very frustrating. I can't get anywhere on those subs and am thinking about giving this sub the majority of my attention again. Also there's the fact that /r/news and /r/politics moderators hassle me daily, I've been banned and unbanned from /r/politics twice in the last month and am getting pretty tired of explaining to them how the AMERICAN Studies Association academic boycott of Israel is in fact US politics my eyes are going to pop out of my head,  the willing cognitive dissonance on behalf of those moderators is really unbelievable.  </TEXT>

If Jewish people have a problem with this they should stop being the most racist group of people on Earth and learn to live amongst the Palestinians peacefully. What kills me is that in America,  England and Canada Jewish people aren't even openly acknowledged as some of the most racist people, and somehow if you bring up their racism and how systemic apartheid is in Israel you are accused of being an antisemitic, racist, without a hint of irony.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well Canada isn't doing it's best to send Canadian dual citizens to England to influence British foreign policy, there is no "Canadian lobby" in England; there to vote for increased Western intervention in the Middle East. America happens to have a great deal of politicians that are Jewish and therefore sympathetic to Israeli interests, coincidentally those same Jewish politicians always tend to vote in favor of bombing the hell out of other countries in the Middle East that doesn't approve of Israel. There is no Canadian equivalent of AIPAC, which tries to do its best to send young Americans off to the Middle East to fight for Israel's interests,  and at every opportunity they used their influence to put the United States on an inexorable path towards war with Iran. AIPAC, just recently put pressure on Congress and Obama to invade Syria of all places, Israel and these Israel 1st politicians just want America to do their dirty work. So now we want to put a self-admitted Zionist, Israeli dual-citizen in the 2nd most important position in terms of US finance ? That is absolutely ridiculous, it's to much of a conflict of interests. Moreover, this appointment would mean that they could not find an able economist throughout the United States to fill this position, which is something that is also ludicrous, and we need this financial wizard from Israel to come here and fix all of our monetary issues is preposterous. Also, how can you possibly compare a Canadian dual citizen, coming from Canada, a nation that isn't known for its controversial foreign policy, and also hasn't been overseeing an ongoing humanitarian disaster for the last 60+ years the way Israel has. I can't think of anytime Canada lobbied America and England to begin bombing a country in the Middle East because they didn't want to do their own dirty work. Israel is infiltrating US foreign policy at every level to ensure their own dominance in the Middle East. A quick look at the Bush Administration cabinet reveals how many of them were Israeli dual citizens, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Pearl etc., and sure enough they had a hostile foreign policy towards nations in the Middle East. In addition really, how the fuck can anyone compare Canada and Israel, Canadians are peaceful, and Israelis, are well, from what I can tell for the most part some of the most racist people on Earth. In Israel, racism is institutional, its taught to  Israeli children in their apartheid education system, children are taught from a young age that Palestinians are subhuman. Canadians hate American warmongering in the Middle East, Israeli's encourage it at every opportunity, and Zionist American politicians quite literally bankroll politicians that they know will vote in favor of US military intervention in the Middle East to strengthen Israel's interests in the region, which consist mostly of destabilizing the region. Also not for nothing, Jewish people make up just 2% of the United States population and 10% of the US Senate, an over representation in the Senate compared to their percentage of US population, a ratio that hasn't been replicated by any other minority in America.

<TEXT> You jest, but those types of comments are exactly what cause posts like mine to be removed. If you were being sarcastic then you should have marked /s after your comment. How is anyone supposed to know you're joking, but then the entire post gets removed because of your complacency. The majority of the time that Jewish people make racist jokes on Reddit about themselves they don't identify themselves as being part of the tribe, and the entire post subsequently is removed. In addition, judging by the content that I post about Israel, one could easily understand how a sympathizer of Israel is pleased with the end result my post critical of Israel being removed. Every time you make a racist joke about Jewish without self identifying as a Jewish person I will report your comment, because by not commenting sarcastically you're painting all critics of Israel and the people that have upvoted my post as racist, anti-semites. Please try to pay attention or I will report your post for racism, indicate your sarcasm with an /s or identify as Jewish person, if you don't you make us look bad, which I imagine would align with your interests quite nicely.  </TEXT>

No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.

<TEXT> James Corbett is an incomparable source of information, he is truly the antidote for Alex Jones. 

If Corbett had as many listeners as Jones and effectively became the representative for all things conspiracy, a position currently held by controlled opposition Jones, we would actually be taken seriously by people. Alex Jones has done an immeasurable amount of damage to conspiracy theorists with his ranting and raving. The mainstream media is comfortable with this paradigm, because juxtaposed to Jones they look like sane arbiters of information. What they don't want is Corbett sitting there with Anderson Cooper, professionally citing his claims in calm reasonable fashion, because that might lend us some credence. 

TL;DR ? 

If everyone who listened to Alex Jones apocalyptic sermons of gloom and doom stopped listening to Alex "never mention Zionism" Jones would subscribe to the Corbett Report, the world would be a better place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfuckingquestionably. 

What the fuck has anyone on this sub done to actually take a stand against their government ? None of us can even imagine being tried and found guilty of High Treason and swiftly handed a life sentence fighting simply for some semblance of an egalitarian society. I bet the majority of the people on this sub have never even attended a protest before and probably couldn't wait to shit on the Occupy protesters on websites like Reddit during those protests cause I mean fuck them right for actually doing something. 

Honestly this a serious question, how white is OP ? 

I've heard people accuse this sub of White Pride b4, but this is a seriously fucking piece of shit post. At least let the man's corpse get cold before u begin inevitably tearing him down.  

He spent 27 years in prison for the possibility that what he was doing would end the apartheid and oppression he watched his parents endure,  sorry if that doesn't impress the keyboard warriors of /r/conspiracy.  Clearly we are the real heroes /s. 

Something about the struggle of breaking free from apartheid and oppression stemming from colonial occupation must not resonate with OP. Probably difficult for most /r/conspiracy subscribers to empathize with an African, former political prisoner turned politician.

I'm not someone who comes here to accuse this sub of racism or anti semitism,  those are usually all bullshit cheap shots taken by shills and trolls.  This post however wreaks of racial undertones,  I'm neither white, black, nor African, I'm Indian living in America so Inc completely neutral here and this post does not sit right with me it just doesn't.  

TL;DR ? 

Yes Mandela is a hero, deal with it. He was no saint, his 2nd wife was a corrupt,  violent woman that would have ultimately tarnished his legacy had he not controversially divorced her and remarried a 3rd time. He kept close ties with controversial African dictators,  and I'm sure he had some skeletons in his closet as well, but a hero he remains none the less.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meet Noam Chomsky:Academic Gatekeeper.  

Noam Chomsky is on the forefront of an establishment co-opted academia. Chomsky for all his seemingly benevolent bespectacled insights about the state of politics in America propagates the 9/11 official story word for word when asked, and is also a proponent of the Federal Reserve System. Websites like Resdit and Democraticunderground prop him up as some sort of Dumbledore of the Internet, but don't be fooled by his faux establishment outrage. Chomsky is an academic gatekeeper and is a powerful form of controlled opposition for the elite.  James Corbett did a podcast about Mr. Chomsky exposing him as the mouthpiece for the elite that he truly is which I have linked to at the end of this comment.

<TEXT> James Corbett just did an amazing podcast of the Corbett Report about this very man called, Meet Noam Chomsky: Academic Gatekeeper. In the podcast Corbett asserts that Chomsky is on the forefront of an establishment co-opted academia that increasingly espouses the beliefs and talking points of a government moving in greater lock step with the military industrial, big oil, central banker operated oligopoly. The podcast analyzes how academia has gradually shifted to become more conservative in the wake of the Vietnam war, and the public relations disaster that ensued on college campuses across the United States in protest of US intervention, which was partially organized by academics that had moral codes. If you don't have time to listen to the podcast which I am linking to at the bottom  this comment, it goes into several other establishment-friendly opinions that Chomsky has supported in the past. Spoiler alert, it turns out that Mr. Chomsky has previously stated that he has no opinion about the Federal Reserve either, he also manages to do some good shill work for fiat currency, he's a real piece of work. I wish so many otherwise rational people wouldn't be so easily hooked in by has anti-Bush rhetoric and soft-spoken, bespectacled persona he has carved out for himself on websites like Reddit or Democraticunderground. At the end of the day Chomsky has nothing truly controversial or groundbreaking to offer the world political discourse, he is a co-opted academic gatekeeper, who does his best to reinforce the false right-left paradigm that plagues this nation so. In addition, I can't recommend the Corbett Report podcast enough to the subscribers of /r/conspiracy.

<TEXT> Hello Mr. Greenwald, first and foremost thank you for all of the incredible journalism over the last few months and over the course of your career. My question is in reference to the MARINA revelations, do you believe that the US government is actively using data gathered via the MARINA program to create a list of Americans considered, for lack of a better term as "undesirables", and based on that classification thereby likely to be targeted by the US government's various agencies for a higher level of scrutiny, such as the  IRS or the Department of Homeland Security ? I know it's quite a leap, and a journalist such as yourself doesn't make claims he isn't prepared to immediately back up with evidence, but I'm asking for purely your opinion and I would like to make that clear, any answer I receive from you will be regarded purely as speculation, unless you say otherwise at the beginning of your response.   </TEXT>

This is the reason that you see a lot of military drills and military activity in September, and the reason that you keep seeing the date October 1st over and over again is because it is the end of the Fiscal year, god this is such a stupid post, I honestly can't recall the last time I saw such transparent bullshit atop /r/conspiracy.

The other countries of Eastern Europe are all featured here as well, this is what I've always contended about the Jewish people, either entire regions of Earth are hateful bigots, or Jewish people have a problem taking advantage of society. How could this many people be bigots in this many instances over the course of nearly 1800 years ? It's a completely ridiculous notion. There's no way that many groups of people over the course of nearly 1800 years have come together as a society and decided that the best course of action for the future of that society would be to expel a segment of the population that tends to find employment in the finance sector, and soon without fail become the wealthiest members of that society and use their new found wealth to subvert that societies laws by making the ruling class, nobility or government indebted to them. It's called a cycle and cycles repeat themselves, in 1939 Hitler sent 937 Jewish refugees to America on the MS St. Louis and America did not except them so there's that as well.

I really have never heard of a Jewish person being even lower middle-class, it just doesn't happen. There are to many other Jewish people in high places, especially Ashkenazi Jewish people to allow a fellow tribe member to struggle in any way. It's pretty much racism to the umpteenth degree, Jewish people only hire and promote other Jewish people. Perfect example David Stern is the NBA commissioner and his replacement, whom he handpicked is the Deputy NBA commissioner Adam Silver, Adam Silver will be the 5th NBA commissioner in the NBA's history and the 3rd Jewish person to hold the position. Mind you there have only ever been approximately 40 Jewish people to ever play in the NBA in it's history.

Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

Oh yea and there's Sirius XM which is also an entirely Jewish operation founded by someone named Rothblatt and the current President   CCO is Scott Greenstein, it goes so deep its blatantly obvious that Americas mass media is owned by Zionist Jewish people, even Reddit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gonna get downvoted for saying this but here goes, the alien stuff is bullshit. The alien/reptilian stuff is a gigantic circle jerk and its a powerful tool to discredit more serious minded conspiracy theorists by proxy. The government, the banks, the mainstream media, the military industrial complex and academia love it that someone like Peter Joseph is on par with David Icke or other well known conspiracy theorists that are nothing more than well publicized crackpots. I'm not sure if David Icke is a complicit troll, engaging in the most elaborate PsyOp in recent memory or he's unwittingly done the most damage to the conspiracy theor movement. Either way David Icke or aliens in general shouldn't be the immediate response in peoples minds to conspiracy theories.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree this is 1 of the best articles I've read analyzing the situation in the Middle East over the last dozen years from a semi well known media establishment. I don't even know how it was allowed to be published; it seems loaded with language rife for Larry Summers' attorneys to be able to lay waste to in court. I imagine there is no shortage of judges licking at the chops to rule in favor of Summers' in a libel case; it's a shame, he's a powerful man. However more power to Alternet for publishing this, this is a REAL analysis of the Middle East turmoil of the last dozen years.

<TEXT> India would not be on the side of the US Allies, it would either be on Russia's side or most likely neutral. Delhi is a long time ally of Moscow, and Russia has a history of selling India weapons. During the Sino-Indian war in 1962 between India and China, Russia supported India and America remained neutral just to give 1 example of many. Trust me, India would remain neutral until Russia and China had their backs against the wall and then when the time comes they would have to throw in with Russia and China. This map is incredibly lopsided towards favoring America, even Venezuela is listed as a US ally, I don't think OP has ever heard of Hugo Chavez. America already has a technological advantage, that we're sure of, so why skew the map unnecessarily in the US' favor ?

<TEXT> I wouldn't be surprised by that. The same statistic is probably true for Egypt and Iraq and elsewhere we contribute massively to.  

Do me a favor. Find the statistics for Egypt and Iraq also. Or other high end donation locations. Let's compare. Because I am seriously doubting is the only place for such things. 

 Or maybe it would be better not to call people children for thinking differently. Yea, that seems like the more commendable thing to do.

1. Afghanistan
2. Israel
3. Iraq
4. Egypt

So there goes your "serious doubt". Israel received more aid than anyone from 1976-2002, and Afghanistan and Iraq only entered in 2002, when we began making in your words "massive contributions" to Iraq and Afghanistan in the form of aerial assaults and carpet bombing cities. The only countries that get more than Israel are ones with ongoing wars with the US, last year the average Afghan earned approximately $430 in US Foreign aid and the average Israeli earned $405 in US Foreign aid, so its still pretty close.  

Also bravo for taking such a courageous militant pro Israel stance I bet that must've been really hard for you to do being a white, Christian man in America. Tell me did you face any harassment or career issues being staunchly pro Israel. It must've been really controversial I mean. 

 Or maybe it would be better not to call people children for thinking differently.

Gimme a fucking break kid this is r/conspiracy if that's the brave insight you arrived at is that Israel is great and all Arabs are crazy then you just failed, unsubscribe and spend more time on r/Christianity, you'll find all the Palestine bashers there queued up for

<TEXT> Illegal occupation? That's a made up term. 

Unlike you, I don't give a fuck. I don't have preferences. 

1. I'll admit that illegal occupation is a made up term when you admit "Jewish" is a made up ethnicity, they are rich white people with big noses, who exploit laws against discrimination and turned themselves into a new group of people post               Holocaust.  The Palestinians are a hell of a lot more Semitic than all of the Ashkenazi Jews running Israel, and an Israeli population geneticist from Johns Hopkins came to that conclusion. Jewish people are Khazars or	Asiatics, and the fact that they get treated like they are an oppressed minority in America is laughable. It's amazing before World War II it was considered racist to refer to Jewish as an ethnicity instead of a religion which had been it's designation for millennia. All of a sudden in the early 1950's America discovers a new ethnic group, the mysterious Jewish people, absolute bullshit, now it's considered racist to refer to Jewish people as Caucasian.

2. For someone who purportedly doesn't give a fuck you've been doing a lot of shilling and distribution of disinformation on this thread. So then why the angry fingers there keyboard warrior ? What is the JIDF giving the most annoying shill an Applebees giftcard as a bonus this month or something ?

<TEXT> How many more lies will you spout on this thread for Israel ?

" Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of military assistance from the United States since World War II, followed by Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, and Pakistan.[22]
Since 1987, the U.S. has provided an average of $1.8 billion annually in the form of Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and funds to support research and development.[2]A bilateral memorandum of understanding was signed in January 2001, at the end of the Clinton administration, under which defense aid was increased to $2.4 billion annually from $1.8 billion, while the $1.2 billion of economic aid would be eliminated. This was predicated on the basis of the defense aid being increased by $60 million per year until the full amount was reached in 2008, while the economic aid is decreased by $120 million per year until eliminated.[3][23] In 2007, the United States increased its military aid to Israel by over 25%, to an average of $3 billion per year for the following ten-year period (starting at $2.550 billion for 2008, growing by $150 million each year).[24] The package started in October 2008, when regular economic aid to Israel's economy ended.[25] Officials have insisted the aid is not tied, or meant to balance, simultaneous American plans to sell $20 billion worth of sophisticated arms to its Arab allies in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia.[25] Former U.S. President George W. Bush assured Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that the U.S. would help keep a "qualitative advantage" to Israel over other nations in the region.[24]
The United States is the largest single supplier of military equipment to Israel. According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, between 1998-2005 the U.S. accounted for the vast majority of Israel's arms transfer agreements, accounting for $9.1 billion out of $9.5 billion worth of agreements.[26]Israel deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast majority of its military purchases from the United States, though it requires permission from the U.S. government for specific purchases. Permission is not always automatic; for instance, in March 2000 it became known that the Israeli government had been refused permission to purchase BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles.[3]
Israel has the world's largest F-16 fleet outside the United States Air Force. With the delivery of 102 F-16Is, scheduled through 2008, the Israeli Air Force will have a total F-16 inventory of 362, in addition to 106 F-15s.[27]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_military_relations#Military_aid_and_procurement

240 billion is Israel's GDP, you knew I was talking about defense aid from the US specifically but you intentionally took me out of context, classic shill move.

Israel is so tiny and densely populated that their civilian casualties would skyrocket in no time, Iran still has enough large swaths of land and friendly neighbors to constantly be staging new strategies and moving large amounts of troops around comfortably and quickly, Israel on the other hand barely has enough space to engage in large military drills without entering Palestine. In a 1 on 1 prolonged war with Iran, Israel always loses. Israel really couldn't hang for a long ground war with many nations, they would end up dragging the United States in, which in turn would  bring in Russia on the other end, so basically we're risking nuclear war for greedy Israel, which you've made abundantly clear that you are all right with, anything for your Space Jesus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what you're saying is that Israel is going to make the United States fight Iran for them, because everyone knows Israel doesn't have it in them to throw down with Iran alone, they lack the manpower, will and national identity and would crumble amidst the 1st real damage to their safe, walled, enclosure-nation, away from the world. AIPAC also lobbied aggressively for the US invasion of Iraq as well as a complicit Zionist owned media misleading  the sheep-like American public along the way. So if it wasn't for Israel getting America to do all of their dirty work for them, that delusional map you linked to really wouldn't be possible now would it ? BTW don't count on a war hungry American public to fight another 1 of Israel's wars for them. Also I take it from your username that you were born in 1991,   yet you speak so casually of mass casualties across the Middle East just so the Israelis can have their blood drenched, biblical land of Israel in all their greedy glory. I bet the toughest thing you've ever done is snipe some Middle Eastern characters on Call of Duty or some other video game, you know nothing of the world. Big talk you've got there, but what's the end game for Israel, what if somehow against all odds Israel managed to achieve the atrocity that is that map, then what, does your space Jesus come back in Jerusalem or something ? No he doesn't. He never does cause it's a fucking fairy tale, how come religious people are unable to comprehend the notion of ALLEGORIES. I'll tell you what will happen though, greedy Israel will continue to expand East into they run into either nuclear Pakistan or nuclear India, take your fucking pick because I bet you in your infinite wisdom which you've accumulated over the course of 22 years as a religious Christian, are also ready to nuke the world so Israel can have a little more land and you increase your likelihood of meeting space Jesus from your fairy tale a little bit more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What part of the words "Western Media Blackout" do you not understand ? PressTV was literally the only site publishing anything positive about Waters or the boycott in general. The other news agencies were all Israeli and you can guess what they reported about the boycott or Waters:
"HOLOCAUST ! HOLOCAUST! HOLOCAUST ! ANTI SEMITE ! ANTI SEMITE ! ANTI SEMITE !" 
So you'll forgive me for not getting my news from a Zionist approved media establishment, besides I never post anything from Press TV, look through my submissions, this is the 2nd time I've posted a PressTV article in 6 months. </TEXT>

Solar panels should have been on the White House for 36 years, beginning in 1977 with Jimmy Carter, before they were cruelly yanked down by the Reagan administration in 1981, because and I'm absolutely serious here, Reagan that they were the embodiment of "big government". Backwardness thy name be Reagan. The solar panels were not costly or wasteful, they just symbolized change and terrified Big Oil, which had a stranglehold over the presidency, since Kennedy's coup d'etat in '63.

<TEXT> The worst part about this is that Senator Feinstein's amendment would mean that her ilk would be the ones deciding which journalists are real journalists, because everyone on r/conspiracy knows who owns the media and they happen to have a lot in common with Diane Feinstein. If Feinstein's amendment is adopted only people like the Bloombergs (Bloomberg), the Newhouses (New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Reddit), the Redstones, the Ochs (New York Times), and the Wenners (Rolling Stone). Basically Feinstein is saying that if you're not Zionist approved you're no longer a journalist, and that is basically the death knell of journalism as we know it. No factor has diluted the quality of journalism or the media as much Zionist consolidation.

<TEXT> The Jewish people depicted in that photograph were not slaves, they simply weren't, they were interned in Nazi Germany, but they were not slaves, for a people to truly be enslaved it has to span across generations. The Jewish internment in Nazi Germany lasted 6 years, further more when looking for a depiction of slavery why look to Nazi Germany ? Why not depict African slavery in America, it is by far the most reprehensible case of slavery, yet OP chose to depict Jews in Nazi Germany where they weren't slaves. I think it's obvious that OP has an agenda he is trying to further, and it's one that attempts to gain Jewish sympathy to justify the Zionist agenda, what either reason is there for such a glaring oversight ?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The phrase that I took away from watching this video was "New Media Class", to describe the talking head phenomena on cable news, with their multi million dollar salaries serving as a poor substitute for the classic muck raking journalism of decades ago. Often those multi million dollar salaries are paid for by parent companies of media conglomerates such as GE to NBC. In other words Brian Williams endorsement to invade Iraq on the Nightly News isn't worth nearly as much if everyone in America is aware that Brian Williams boss at GE is profiting directly from the invasion/occupation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's practically a tragedy that, Jewish people who are not a minority, they're white people with big noses, play the race card more than any other group of people. If they're such an oppressed minority, then why do Jewish people own practically every large media corporation in America, a Jewish person, Samuel Newhouse, owns Reddit's parent company, Advanced Publication. For Jewish people to be an oppressed minority in America there would be some oppression, instead I don't even think there are any poor Jewish people in America, not 1. To be an oppressed minority in America you're usually subjected to some sort of societal or culturally inflicted economic despair, Jewish people on the other hand are the wealthiest group of people in America by far. Just take a look at the list of bank executives, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Hollywood studio executives and members of Congress that are Jewish and mostly Ashkenazi Jews to be more specific. Jewish people have hijacked and cheapen the Race card by being wealthy and white and still constantly complaining about racism so in actual instances of racism against real minorities they find that the race card is weaker in their actual instance of racism, because of it's constant abuse by over privileged, litigious Jewish people and the Anti-Defamation League. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of "Admin." The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid "dens of crime" that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the office of a thoroughly nasty business concern."

<TEXT> The 1st thing I thought of when I read this article was :

"Goodbye local investigative news!"

Just like how mainstream media is drivel; the local news will soon be completely overrun with talking points for the talking heads on cable news. Just another domino in the downfall of the dissemination of information from the corporate media establishment which grows more conglomerated by the year. 

Sam Zell, the owner of Tribune Co., is adding to his collection of media entities quietly, engaging in this purchase just before a long 4th of July weekend, in other words this 10 figure transaction will be old news by Monday. Zell, is worth $4 billion, and is a shady real estate dealer who has worked to eliminate rent control laws to jack up rates in Florida for over a decade, and he has been one of the most outspoken CEO's in the wake of the burst of the mortgage bubble; saying that :

"This country [real estate market] needs a cleansing. We need to clean out all those people who never should have bought homes in the first place."
[20] He was referencing the many consumers who purchased homes at prices well above their means, as well as the mortgage lenders who encouraged those loans.

So because this story won't be news, and it's pretty much blatantly obvious why this story won't be news (i.e because it's about who controls the news) those were the important bulletpoints.

<TEXT> Michael Hastings and Glenn Greenwald certainly both have/did have an abundance of enemies with military training and the means to coordinate an assassination. To me this is blatant intimidation of investigative journalists around the nation, the nature with which the New York Times barely mentioned his death, has all the airs of "an inconvenient situation being swept under the rug" by TPTB.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The coroners are saying that it could take up to 6 weeks to determine an official cause of death, what we have to do in the meantime is keep this story as fresh and robust as possible in people's memories; so when the near certain bullshit cause of death is revealed, at least a decent amount of people's bullshit radar will be going off. 

To say that Michael Hastings was a danger to the military establishment is a gross understatement, the amount of enemies he made by triggering the General McChrystal resignation are innumerable. So many military careers and potential promotions were derailed when the chain of command was upended by Hastings. 

I think at best this was a sloppy, public hit on a journalist by TPTB, who had already made his share of powerful enemies and was quite possibly about to uncover yet another scandal in Washington. At worst this was a clear message to investigative journalists around the country to start toeing the company line.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the trolls like AnSq, on this thread, it's not the government it's self that is paying these contractors, it's special interests groups like Crossroads GPS, the NRA, or a slew of other conservative interests groups that are simply vastly underrepresented on the Internet on social media sites, which are also a popular venue for political discourse. Dick Cheney isn't sitting around wondering why his hunting photos aren't getting more likes on FaceBook, that's Karl Rove and his army of suits and PR agent's job. BTW, this happens all the time, to anyone who can't guess this post was mainly in response to the naked shilling that has taken place on this sub, and the rest of the Internet courtesy of Monsanto and their army of subcontractors. If I had to present a solution to the problem, I'd probably have to go with the very unpopular among new users, 30 day old account requirement to post on r/conspiracy. Also the majority of the accounts I've seen nakedly shilling for Monsanto are pretty knew, and their overview is saturated with down voted comments, I thought this was common knowledge.

<TEXT> How about a round of applause for the PR department at Monsanto working overtime on a Saturday, Memorial day weekend just to spread a little more disinformation, and log some serious man/shill hours to manipulate public opinion, whatever the hell that is. I've been perusing the different mainstream websites and this global protest was barely a blip on their radar. I wonder how many new social media accounts were set up across the Internet to shill for Monsanto, thousands, tens of thousands? When does astroturfing online political forums by special interests group and corporations become something Congress gives a fuck about ? Course if Congress gave a shit about the general population this protest wouldn't have been necessary in the 1st place. With this corporate media and astroturfed Internet it makes u wonder when it will get noticeably absurd to the flock of sheep that watch the mainstream news, that it's all a sham, there could be looting and riots in the street outside your home as Fox   Friends prattle on about the War on Christmas. Grocery stores being looted and the military on the streets whilst the #1 story on Huffingtonpost is about Lindsay Lohan's latest arrest. Seriously though fuck paid shills, they irreparably damaged Internet discourse.  </TEXT>

This was coming from a mainstream media Zombie who probably literally allows himself to drool as he switches between Fox, CNN, and MSNBC, like a baby being spoon fed. The antithesis of laziness would be to do your own research and wade into the conspiracy spectrum. Laziness would be allowing the same corporations that stand to make a fortune off of going to war tell you why the United States should go to war. Anyone who's combed the Internet for an alternative history of banking, wars, or genocide can tell you it's exhaustive work.

How could Exxon or Apple be more valuable than the banks that are backed by the entire Federal government and underwritten by our taxpayer dollars. Let's see how quickly the government would intervene with a multibillion dollar bailout for Apple and Google because they were to big to fail, no of course not, they would just allow Samsung to take over the market share and American tech start ups would get more R D investment. To this the critics say "oh well the banks provide a valuable service", well to that I'd retort, that I'd consider it valuable if they would at least let the taxpayer bend over first of their own volition instead of violently bending the taxpayer over the table and reaming us out.  </TEXT>

My guess, he didn't want to make it to obvious which group of people would benefit the most from the "single bullet/lone gunmen" theories. Kennedy had a non  interventionist foreign policy, which basically meant he would let Israel do its own dirty work which they've never been good at. Kennedy's vehement denial of Operation Northwoods coupled with Executive Order 11110 were enough to get him whacked. Not fighting Israel's wars for them and issuing gold and silver bonds to the tune of $5 billion in debt-free currency in effect circumventing the Federal

<TEXT> I posted an article about this the other day, and it got a lot of upvotes on r/conspiracy and even reached the top of the page. Despite all the upvotes, the comment thread was saturated by what looked like shill accounts using ad hominem attacks to discredit me and Dr. Eran Elhaik's findings. As a person of color and a 1st generation immigrant I find the fact that Jewish people who are closer to Caucasian than they'd like you to believe, use all of the advantages of this "Chosen People" blood claim to Israel to strengt their narrative. In fact Jewish people are some of the most powerful industrialists and bankers on Earth,and they still clamor for international support as an oppressed minority, when there are so many other groups who could use the resources being lavished upon the Zionist agenda. Also most actual minorities in America don't even view Jews as an actual minority, more like a subset of Caucasian, per capita Jewish people are much wealthier than any other religious or ethnic group per capita. Also there's the coincidence of Israel and AIPAC lobbying Congress to invade Iraq, Iran, Syria etc. basically because it's way easier to manipulate the war monger Americans to fight their wars for them using the media (which they also control 80% of) and off their regional enemies 1 preemptive mass troop deployment and ground invasion at a time. The fact is that Jewish people twist the oppressed minority narrative so much to the point it devalues actual victims of racial prejudices claims. Seth MacFarlane made a joke at the Oscars about how Jewish people control the media and he had the ADL (Anti Defamation League) down his throat with allegations of antisemitism and racism. All of this contributes to the narrative of America being post racial and overly politically correct, but its just sensitive Jewish special interest groups inflating the incidences of accusations of racism. BTW the entire reason the ADL was founded was to combat antisemitism, I'm on my phone and can't track down the Wikipedia link but it's there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All that flowery: "We are all a global race man, we just need to set aside our differences and take care of Mother Earth" stuff is really nice and all in theory. Meanwhile in reality there are 1.6 million Palestinians are crammed into the Gaza Strip, of which 1 million have official "refugee" status with the UN. The Gaza Strip also has the 6th highest population density on Earth with 9,713 people per square mile in this landlocked, heavily policed, arid, baron sub-nation. Of course if you look at events in human history in 600 million year time spans, humans fighting humans over land is inconsequential but those aren't the units of measurement we are working with. Thousands of people that were children in 1948 when the original exodus occurred are still alive today; living on that tiny strip of land bouncing around between temporary borders; no nation to call home and through no fault of your own. The Palestinian people didn't get themselves persecuted all across Asia, the Middle East, and all of Europe and get themselves practically chased out of nations with torches. Look at what they have been reduced to; Gaza is a humanitarian crisis, as Israeli's are living in relative luxury on what used to be; just a generation ago Palestinian land and was that way for more than a thousand years. The Palestinian have become an international spectacle, they were not the world's burden, and now they have been reduced to 2nd class citizens in their own backyard.

<TEXT> I don't think people here in America spend enough time recognizing the fact that 725,000 Palestinians were displaced and turned into refugees in 1948. Since 1948 their situation has gotten bleaker as it has become abundantly obvious that neither the United States, the UN, England or anyone else would be willing to back at the absolute rights for Palestinians living in destitution on the Gaza strip in refugee tents without access to water or electricity. 725,000 people, it may not seem like much but that's more people than live in Memphis, Washington or Boston. Imagine if the international community told the citizens of 1 of those U.S cities they would have to leave immediately and start their lives over again from square 1 in a tent in and around the old Super Dome, only this Super Dome is in the middle of the desert. Here in the United States things like that are only acceptable when they happen to black or brown people, and that is the entire crux of what I am trying to  say, Jewish people share more common DNA with Europeans and Asians particularly Slavic and Turkish than they do with people with Middle Eastern ancestry. This is about acknowledging a fact, I don't understand why we trust DNA in every other facet of life like determining criminal cases or the paternity of a child, yet this DNA is wrong or suspect because it doesn't fit the establishment's agenda. 
8 million Khazar's did not simply vanish into thin air, they converted to Judaism, and it is simply much easier politically for a group of people who are NOT believed to be Caucasian to occupy a nation in the Middle East than it would be for Caucasian's or at least it should be in theory. The problem is, real minorities in America, people of color and 1st generation immigrants, myself included in both categories barely consider Jewish people to be a minority, they are basically Caucasian at a glance and are also more affluent per capita than Caucasian's in Western Europe and the U.S. I know there is no such thing as birthright to a piece of land, but at the same time, Americans have never all collectively been ran out of their nation and turned into 2nd class citizen on what used to be their soil, a humiliation Palestinians deal with everyday. Look I'm a super liberal guy and I have a HELL of a lot more in common with the average person of Jewish descent than I would with the average Palestinian what with the fundamentalist religion and all that, but right is right, and pushing people out of their country to correct an injustice that occurred thousands of years ago is not right.

That is not enough to justify this near 7 decade long military occupation and ensuing humanitarian disaster.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To everyone here calling me an anti-semite:
A. You are predictable and boring.
B. Anyone who doesn't understand the inherent importance of this is being willfully ignorant of its magnitude.
C. Muslims are 2nd class citizens in Israel, and don't get me started on the perpetual humanitarian crisis that is the Gaza Strip.
D. Jewish people FORCED PALESTINIANS OFF OF THEIR LAND, they have no interest in living alongside Muslims and do what they can to create an atmosphere of intolerance against them. 
E. Their only claim to the land is from the Bible, nothing genetic, they may have in the tradition of nomadic people, blown through the area, but the historical claim belongs to the Palestinians, they lived there MUCH LONGER. 
F. 8 million Khazar's do not vanish, they simply do not, unless you're saying they were wiped out in a genocide, and I think it's best we don't stray into that area.
G. This is what Mahatma Gandhi has to say on the issue of Israel, and from what I hear he's kind of a pacifist:
Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home

<TEXT> That was great, so it was about the privatization of the press in America, I imagine it's a pretty well known fact amongst r/conspiracy subscribers that 96% of the media in the United States is owned by just 5 corporations, those 5 being GE, VIACOM, COMCAST, NEWSCORP   DISNEY.  Of course in Kennedy's day there were more than 60 independent news organization's, I don't think even Kennedy could have foreseen the erosion of the media to the extent that it has in such as short period of time. He gave this speech in 1961 and since then the media has been collectively bought and sold more times than I care to analyze.  </TEXT>

The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men." -Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course Batman beat Superman, Batman is a heroic, billionaire capitalist, whereas Superman works for the press, trying to enlighten the masses and expose the seedy nature of reality. Superman came here from another planet to fight crime, making him the ultimate immigrant, whereas Batman, we know he comes from good Wayne family stock, old money. Only in America would the industrialist with no superpowers with to much time on his hands defeat an alien with super powers. Meanwhile Monday morning Bruce Wayne is going to hire lobbyists to pressure Congress to pass legislation that would break up the unions at Wayne Industries which would benefit him in a bevy of ways.  </TEXT>
