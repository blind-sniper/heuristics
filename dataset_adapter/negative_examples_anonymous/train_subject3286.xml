<TEXT> Umm... like *every* movie? Pretty much every movie has a male and female character that are not romantically involved. For example, in The Place Beyond the Pines, Romina is not romantically involved with Jason. Why? They are mother and son. In Birdman, Michael Keaton's character is not romantically involved with Emma Stone's character. Why? They are father and daughter. In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar is not romantically involved with any human female character. Why? That's bestiality. In The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne is not involved with a random female extra. Why? They never even met. </TEXT>

The obvious answer is The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as it is over 200 hours long (as a user has stated before me). Arkham Knight isn't nearly as long, but still a respectable length. Halo: MCC is 4 games in one (5 if you buy [or receive for free if you played MCC around the month span after its release] ODST) with an addictive multiplayer. If you like racing games, Forza Horizon 2 is huge: I've played for God knows how many hours, and am only at 27% game completion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, that is exactly what I am trying to say. TDK is similar in tone to Batman Begins. 

Is that a serious question? All the brooding darkness that made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight so special is completely gone in The Dark Knight Rises. </TEXT>

What? No, I said that The Dark Knight Rises is a huge departure in tone from both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.

<TEXT> I feel that Christopher Nolan didn't really have his heart in the project. It felt more like he was trying to fulfill a contract and get it over with rather than make a film he was passionate about. I theorize that Heath's death depressed him and put him off track. The Dark Knight Rises is a huge departure in tone from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> uhhh... alright, fair enough 

[I walk away, then once you can't see me I run to the bathroom and cry my eyes out. You come to the bathroom door and knock, asking if everything is okay. The I scream, "NO! EVERYTHING IS NOT OKAY! IT IS NEVER OKAY! AND YOU WONDER WHY I CUT MYSELF!" You sigh, apologizing, then say, "Father Magoo, this can't keep going on like this. I don't know why you are so hell-bent on destroying your life. You need to turn this shit around, Father Magoo. You know... umm... Father... I never told you this, but I love you... I really do." I open the door slowly, tears falling from my eyes. "Really, BubblegumIPA? Really? Do you mean it?" I sniffle a little bit. Okay, a lot. I sniffle for like five minutes straight. "Yes, Father, I love you. I didn't know how to express it to you, so I have heavily insulted you this whole time as I grasped for a way to show my affection. I didn't quite understand how you were making me feel until now. I love how you smile when the blue moon reaches its peak. I love how you grasp flowerpots before kissing the flowers. I love the way you do your little dance after every heartfelt sermon. Father Magoo, I love everything about you. We need to be together. I know how much you care about the no sex 'til marriage thing, and I understand that. So why wait? Let's get married today. Right now." I graze my right index finger across my lip, contemplating the impact of this revelation. "I... I love you too, BubblegumIPA. Let's get married, Bub!" You grace me with a half-smile, subtlety rewarding me for using the pet name that I so often use for you and you alone. "I now pronounce us..." I inhale deeply. "...husband and wife!" I smile jovially. "I may now kiss the bride!" I proceed to perform the aforementioned act, and we passionately fuck each other's brains out after the best man, who has been watching us this whole time, slaps your ass.] </TEXT>

Arthur gets romantically involved with Natalie Portman (who plays herself), who happens to be Kevin's old flame. Hijinks ensue. Also the show is now a sitcom filmed in front of a live audience.

<TEXT> Not trying to be a smartass, but there is no title track as the album is not called "Ava Adore." Billy said the title is actually a play on words, as "Adore" sounds like "A door," as he knew it was a huge departure from the original sound, so it is "a door" opening for the band.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. Calories in, calories out. 

If you eat a calorie surplus due to this really cool cheese that I found at Trader Joes, you will gain just as much weight as with an identical calorie surplus caused by an episode of wearing carb goggles. The ketogenic diet is a good tool because being in ketosis induces a loss of appetite. It sounds like you're experiencing emotional eating, meaning you eat even when you are not hungry. You need to face your fears and grow some balls (wait you are female so that saying will not motivate you). Just track your macros. Fuck. Alright. I don't think my text will motivate you, so I will have to motivate you some other way. [Billy Corgan is watching you and judging you.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) If that doesn't motivate you, nothing will.  </TEXT>

Calories are a *limit,* not a goal. If you're not hungry, don't eat. 

I have been diagnosed with anorexia and have struggled with bulimia (no formal diagnosis), so I know my shit.

<TEXT> 1200-1400???????? You pig! your diet is not extreme enough. I went on a permacut last year and went from obese to 106 lbs. (M/5'7") and was hospitalized for anorexia. I was eating a maximum of 1400 calories on a ketogenic diet and started eating less and less until I wasn't eating anything at all. (yeah I was joking when I called you a pig; you really shouldn't go down the same path as me, but if you have bellyfat and boobs, you should keep cutting, as it is much healthier to be underweight than overweight) </TEXT>

<TEXT> you need to hit the gym and bulk up. also take some martial arts classes. then if he hits you, you can kick his ass.

or you can call the cops on him for domestic assault

either way, lift weights and learn martial arts. there's nothing wrong with gaming, but it shouldn't be your only hobby. I also like inline skating, reading novels, and trying to get laid at bars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok let's get this over with. my gamertag is Magoo Senior. I need this shirt because I love pugs and if I express my love of pugs I will most definitely get laid. I'm kind of broke so I can't buy it myself. A pug shirt would be a great conversation starter, and I am a very charismatic guy. I am quite handsome, but I need to work on my body. I used to be fat, so I have some loose skin. I probably need loose skin surgery, and I should start lifting again to look aesthetically pleasing to the ladies. I don't imagine that chicks like looking at underweight guys with tits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Son, I need more information.

...

Deadlift, Squat, Bench PRs, and of course your 8 rep max for the Facepull. Your height, weight, bfp. How many friends do you have? Do you have a girlfriend? Is your middle name "Max"? How many Daughters of the Realm of the Garden of Men have you seduced? What are your political views? How long is your penis? What are your favorite hobbies? Are you currently employed? Have you ever stepped foot in a Planet Fitness? Are you subscribed to Jason Blaha on Youtube? What are your top 12 favorite films? Favorite books? Television shows? Videogames? Are you a convicted pedophile? Do you live in a house or a boat? Natty? Favorite color? When did you first discover masturbation? Exact date. 

...

Some of these inquireies might seem irrelevent to the question at hand, but please bear with me. Lifting weights is mostly mental in the Realm of the Garden of Men. In order to help, I must get to know you. It's not as cut and dried as you think, believe it or not. It is a very intimate sport.  </TEXT>

I have since lost 10 lbs after re-starting keto. My question is: when do I stop cutting so I don't end up in the same place again? The bodyfat calculator put me at around 19% bodyfat. Due to my last extreme cut, I have really no muscle whatsoever. I'm pretty sure I would be considered skinnyfat right now as I have a slight belly and man boobs. Indeed I don't want to bulk quite yet. Should I cut to 120 lbs?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have cut down from 205 (obese) from February of this year to 138. The body fat calculator at my gym says that I am around 12% bodyfat. I am male, 17, and 5'7". I didn't start tracking calories until 71 days ago, so I can't say what my calories were before I started tracking, but as of 71 days ago I have kept my calories at or below 1,400. Is it necessary to reverse diet to maintenance calories (adding a set amount of calories each week until maintenance is achieved)? If so, how would I go about this? How many calories would I add per week?

<TITLE> The Creatine Monster </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-19 19:16:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On a cold Friday afternoon, I had come home from school. I had been thinking of the gym all day. I was hungry, didn't have any lunch. In fact, I didn't eat because I spent the money. For the past month I was saving up for something. Something special which I bought at GNC. I was surprised they didn't ask for ID; I was pretty sure the cashier noticed how nervous I was. Anyways, my mom asked my how my day was when I got home, but I ignored her. I have more important things to do. I run to the bathroom and unpack my bag. In my school bag is a white plastic bag from GNC. I open the bag, first removing the receipt and flushing it down the toilet to get rid of the evidence. My heart was racing now. I unpack the creatine monster from the bag.

I wonder what people will be asking me when they see that I will be 50lbs heavier. Should I say I was just eating a lot? I remove the label from the tub and tear it into a thousand small pieces. I flush that down the toilet, too. It is time now. I run up to my room when my mom ask me what I am holding. I panic, sweat drips down my forehead and my teeth chatter. "Mom, it's just for a school project". "What project?" "I don't know mom I just started it!". A tear runs down my cheek. I run upstairs and open the creatine, scooping upservings into a clear water bottle. What have I gotten myself into? I fill it with water and drink it. There is no turning back now. The creatine monster is inside me now, it will control me. What should I do if I die? I cant let my family know about this.

I open the creatine tub and throw it all out the window; a white cloud of mysterious dust sparkles into the wind so graciously. I feel the substance taking control of me; I am now the monster. I walk downstairs, its time to work out; time to get big. Now I worry, I don't want to get too big; people will think I use steroids. I do use steroids. No I don't. Creatine. All I see is the weights now, I am almost downstairs when I hear "Do you want a cookie I just baked?" I know I do not have time for this shit now. "No mom I do not want a fucking cookie." I walk in the basement and drop to my knees before the weights, tears running down my cheeks. I turn to the right and look at myself in the mirror. Oh god, what have I done? </TEXT>

<TEXT> (Don't say "Get a bigger size." That's not the problem. They fit perfectly.)
I bought a pair of Under Armour ["Core"](http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13050949) compression shorts, and after less than 3 months of wear, a hole appeared at the leg seam. Both leg seams were falling apart. 
I'm thinking of buying a new pair of compression shorts. How do I prevent them from breaking down? Is there a certain way of washing them? Should I get a different brand/model? </TEXT>
