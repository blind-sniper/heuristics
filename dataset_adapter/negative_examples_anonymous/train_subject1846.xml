Is there any motivation you have that you could share with me? How do I just stop wasting time on reddit and go work on my dream?

<TEXT> What you're describing is Rogue One. And I don't know about you but I don't want it to be too "techy". Star Wars (the original trilogy) had a visual theme of "aged future". That's more appealing to me then bright and shiny Clone Wars. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Will theatres play the original Star Wars before the Force Awakens comes out on Dec. 18? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 01:38:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never seen any of the Star Wars movies on the big screen however I absolutely love it. I was only 7 when RotS came out, so that was too young for me to see it in theatres. I would love to see Star Wars IV-VI on the big screen before I see TFA, because I plan on marathoning them before the new movie anyway. 

I reached out to Cineplex (Canadian movie theatre chain) on Twitter to ask if we would be getting some screenings, but to no avail. I was wondering if anyone here had heard about theatres planning on playing it, news articles suggesting something, or if you think it's likely/unlikely to happen. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are some essential movies for film students? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-13 12:12:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm heading off to university this fall where I will be hopefully learning some valuable skills in the field of film. The course I'm taking balances both film study and also hands on moviemaking. From there I hope to get a job in the industry I love.

So, I was wondering if some former students of film or people who would consider themselves well versed in film could recommend me some movies that are sure to be discussed and studied by my class. Or films that you personally think that everyone should watch before they try their hand at making their own. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want Star Wars to go down the path of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Every film in the MCU is formulaic and uninspired. The Marvel movies aren't films as art, they are films as a product. I don't know about you but I much prefer films as art, and I believe Star Wars films have been art for the past 30 years or so. The MCU is entirely forgettable, and that's what Star Wars will become. Soon, Star Wars won't be special. It'll be another peg on the Hollywood machine, and it makes me sad to think about. 

Telling the backstory of every character cheapens them. You know what Obi-Wan did while on Tatooine? Nothing. He was a hermit who hid around watching Luke grow up. That's what I think. Maybe you think something different. But if we get a trilogy of Obi-Wan films, then both of our personal backstories are rendered void. And instead we get some generic blockbusters about how Obi-Wan secretly dueled with a Sith or something. I don't want that. 

I know I'll get downvoted for this but I'm speaking my mind anyway. What you call enrichment of the Star Wars universe, I call the cheapening of the great original story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but the good thing was that you could dismiss it. I, as well as many other people, only care about the films. The EU was great because it allowed for the people who were hungry for more SW content to have access to it. But let's face it, if you made a movie about a cloned Palpatine, or whatever other ridiculous, glorified fan fiction makes up the EU, it would be trash, and it would also detract from the original films. But that's just my two cents.

Same goes with Rebels and Clone Wars. Disney can say that Ashoka is canon, but most people would agree that no, Anakin didn't have an apprentice. 

I don't want to know what happened to Han before ANH. Let the viewer decide, because it doesn't matter. I don't want to know how Boba Fett came to be, the mystery that surrounds him is his best part. Don't shove characters into movies based on the fact that people like them, because it can destroy the artistic integrity of their story. 

Star Wars is a vast universe of endless wonderful possibilities. Tell a new story for Pete's sake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This question of "What happened between this episode and this episode?" and "What happened to this character before this episode?" will ultimately destroy the Star Wars franchise. It's fine as books but we're seeing it start with films like Han Solo. Soon there will be a Greedo movie and a Wedge Antilles movie and a young Lando movie and a movie that took place between ANH and ESB starring Leia and Chewie. Or maybe it's just me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very cool stuff. One thing I hope for the new trilogy is that there aren't too many Jedi. The OT was great cause there was only a few Jedi remaining, and the PT kind of took away from that with the crazy amount of Jedi. An oriental actor with a samurai style is very intriguing though. Also good to see that Asians actually exist in this universe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is that Luke was swayed by the dark side, but ultimately triumphed over it and learned balance. It would be annoying to unwrite all of that for the sake of the new trilogy. 

When I said I could see it under certain circumstances, I was thinking more along the lines of he goes a little insane while in exile. I just don't think his character would be the kind of person to drop all that he's learned throughout his journey and become evil. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Boba Fett has no place in Ep7. THAT would be lazy storytelling. I can see Luke going to the darkside under certain circumstances, despite the fact that it is a retread of Vader, and goes against his character. I'm not hoping for that though.

What I do want to see is good writing, as in dialogue that doesn't make you cringe. I also want to see some new and interesting characters, things we haven't seen before. My worry is that JJ will try too hard to focus on the OT and the past, that he won't be able to move us forward enough.

In terms of the returning cast, I really only care about Luke. Han and Leia seem like they are characters who were never meant to get old. I don't really want to see old Leia in a slave outfit or old Han struggling to catch his breath while walking.

All in all, I want to see something written well that is not too hung up on the OT. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in a SW thread on 4chan and someone said that a test cut was shown to the guys at Disney and no one really knew what to make of it because it was very bloated in terms of characters.

Now obviously we can take this with a grain of salt because there was no source or explanation, but it got me thinking that he may be right considering the amount of characters which will be featured in TFA. I would list them all but I'm sure everyone here is well aware.

So I wanted to know your thoughts on this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Particle Playground Smoke Effect Help (Beginner) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-27 01:27:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello folks, I am pretty new to after effects so bear with me. 

I followed [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx0bKB9aL08) tutorial on how to make smoke in after effects, using the particle playground effect. So I got my desired smoke effect, and all is well, except for one problem. At the start of my 5 second composition, there is no smoke, but as you play the composition, the smoke emerges from the position at which I put the producer (or whatever you call the point of origin for the particles). What I want is for the smoke to already be at its maximum height at the start of the composition. I can't figure out how to do that. 

I hope you guys understand what I mean by that, and if not, I'll add screenshots from my composition. Can anyone help me out and let me know how to make it so that the smoke is already at maximum height at the start of my composition?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How would you feel if Disney remade the prequels? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-04 18:53:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So let's say episodes 7-9 all turn out to be successful, what would you think about a remake of episodes 1-3 (assuming that is legally possible)? They would stick to the same storyline and plot relatively, but get rid of things that were quite obviously failures, and maybe add some new things in to make it feel like a different movie, and fix George Lucas' problems. Then these prequels would replace the old ones as canon, and the old ones could be called the "Jar Jar Trilogy" or something and will basically be referred to as Star Wars' blunder years. 

I think it could definitely work if done correctly. The prequels are actually a great story, just not told very well, in my opinion. What do you think about this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just learned of this recently in my high school history class. At the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great was about to be killed by Spithridates, a satrap, from behind. As his arm was striking, Cleitus the Black severed his arm just before he could deal the finishing blow. Cleitus the Black was a commanding officer of Alexander. I did a project on the battle. It was really like out of a movie. What's ironic is, later in Alexander the Great's conquest, he killed Cleitus in a drunken quarrel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said a "black person is in prison."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies blacks, I am telling you, specifically, in Ebolatology, no one calls black people prisoners. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "negro family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Niggerae, which includes things from niggers to negroes to lightskins.
So your reasoning for calling a black person a prisoner is because random people "call the black ones prisoners?" Let's get sandniggers and mexicans in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a nigger or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A nigger is a nigger and a member of the negro family. But that's not what you said. You said a black person is a prisoner, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the negro family niggers, which means you'd call lightskins, sandniggers, and other races prisoners, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? </TEXT>
