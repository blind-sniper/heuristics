<TEXT> Thanks!! Oh jeez, you've got me stumped. I was going to say pita chips, but I guess that constitutes as bread as well. Honestly, if you really feel like eating it and don't have a substitute for bread, you can totally just use a fork/spoon and eat it! My sister dove into it after a while, she couldn't hold back! I hope that helps a bit, I can't think of much else besides bread or some type of chip! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't lie, I didn't read EVERY single word. I tried to speed read through most of what you said and I understand most of the situation. However, in my opinion, I am in no way saying that I have any idea what it's like to be a victim or to be close to someone who was a victim. The story was just touching and I felt some obligation to voice my thoughts. Hopefully they reach you through the flood of comments.

I really think you made the right choice here. I cannot believe the lack of contact and respect her and her family have shown you. Granted, they are her family and they should be sticking by her side regardless of the crappy decisions she makes.

In the end, you did your best. You have to give yourself some credit, you did your best to make it work, to give her her own space, to let her recover and come back to you. I don't care if she needed to, "take her sexuality back," that sounds like a load of bullshit. I feel like an asshole for saying it, but someone needs to tell the truth. If she were to do that, she should've done it with you because she supposedly loved you and wanted to be with you. Being a victim does not give her the right to mush your face in the dirt. Not when you're supposed to be partners for a lifetime. 

If she wants to communicate through her therapist then good, let her do that and leave the letter with her therapist. That's the way she wants to do things because she is too afraid to confront you and have a real conversation then so be it. How could she possibly have sex with another man and then treat you like a troll after you try and kiss her. How dare she? 

As I said, I speak for myself and my own thoughts. My opinions are my own. Maybe the mentality is different as a victim. That is something I pray I never experience, or anybody I know should ever have to experience. I am truly sorry for her, you, and everyone surrounding you both. Best of luck to you both. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just bought a new 200C 2WD and I love it as well. I really don't see the problem with this. If anything it removes clutter from the climate control and arm rest area. Honestly, if you have a problem with it then you're just not paying attention. I've never had an issue distinguishing the difference between this new knob and the climate control. Great car overall so far!

Edit: problem with the parking knob, not the electronic brake, I realized I sounded kind of like an asshole to you without addressing what I was really talking about. Sorry! Directed towards the picture not you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't a shower thought it's an opinion. Yes, Christians believe that they are solely responsible for the death of Jesus Christ without ever even have being around at the time. But that doesn't make them responsible now if he were to appear, that thought is beyond comprehension. There would be no Christianity without Christ. So it doesn't make sense to begin with. Second, people judging based off of skin color, if you've ever been to Israel most Israelis are a white skin tone or a middle eastern mix which resembles a Caucasian. Everyone else is a tourist. It's an uneducated guess, like most stabs at religion. The only reason why it got so much popularity is because 90% of users seem to lean towards an atheist bias. </TEXT>

<TEXT> COMPROMISE. Seriously, it's key. You'll never get anywhere if you two can't come up with some sort of middle ground during an argument. Sure you'll have your fights and fits of rage regardless, but at some point you both need to come to some sort of an agreement that benefits the both of you. That being said, don't be a complete push over either and let her have everything. Make sure you're coming out with something as well.

Another huge thing is trust. You need to have the utmost trust and respect for this person. She needs to be your best friend. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's the truth. You need to be able to trust her to go and do whatever she pleases. And vise versa, same goes for her, she needs to be able to trust you too. 

If you have any doubts about this person at all, then forget it. Don't plan on it being a long lasting relationship if this isn't what you want for the rest of your life. Don't settle for anything less then the best in your eyes. 

Most of all, have fun with it. You'll learn knew things about her everyday (again cheesy, I know sorry). 

Hope this helps a bit! May not be exactly what you're looking for, but it's what I've learned over the years! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty random, but I was driving to school in upstate New York and while on my way I saw this morbidly obese child skip around his yard. When he came full circle around the yard he met up with his grandmother and started to frantically beat her in public. I wasn't sure whether to stop or keep going.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the question! My family and I have always vacationed in the Cape, ever since I was little. The beach and lighthouse theme has been a huge part of my life, we have pictures of lighthouses everywhere at home. That was my main inspiration for the piece. The symbolism of guidance and light were also pretty huge to me. That lighthouse specifically was just because I really appreciated the design!  </TEXT>
