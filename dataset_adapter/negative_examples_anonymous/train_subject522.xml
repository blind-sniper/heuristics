<TEXT> The Guardian's best 1000 novels of all time.  They seem to have collated a lot pf existing lists so most of the old regulars appear.  

http://gu.com/p/2nm2c/sbl

It's an odd mix.  

I've only read two books based on this list's recommendations - The Poisoned Chocolates Case and The Wimbledon Poisoner and was very underwhelmed by both.  Anyone see any gems on the list?

Edited to include link to list - thought I had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Behind the Scenes at the Museum is in my top 10 books of all time. I enjoyed Life After Life well enough and I'm going to start a God in Ruins this week but compared to her first, brilliant novel everything that came after it was readable but inferior. </TEXT>
