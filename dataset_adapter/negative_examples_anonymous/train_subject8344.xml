It is insane to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results. When the rhetoric dusts settles down in the years to come, history will show Obama had the right approach and he will be remembered for it. That is unless we elect Scott Walker and he goes to war with Iran on day one of his presidency.

We have been doing this for decades and it had been a total failure. The time has come to put an end to this insanity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tahoe is very special in a lot of ways. 

* The water in Lake Tahoe could cover a flat area the size of California to a depth of 14 inches. This is enough to supply everyone in the United States with 50 gallons of water per day for 5 years. And believe it or not, the amount of water that evaporates from the surface of Lake Tahoe every year could supply a city the size of Los Angeles for 5 years.

* Tahoe has never frozen over. Waters are so cold in Lake Tahoe, staying a constant 39 degrees. The Lake Tahoe Basin has its share of below-freezing days and nights, but surprisingly enough the Lake itself has never frozen over. On occasion, Emerald Bay has been covered with a layer of ice, and ice also forms in cold protected inlets. However, Lake Tahoe's great depth and volume of water is always in motion and keeps it from being the world's largest ice rink.

And by-the-way, that big earthquake has been supposedly coming now for decades. I'm sure it will eventually but we have too many others things to worry about in the present to freak about something that may never happen in our lifetime.

And this year it is drought. Next year it will probably be floods. It's always something. You can't escape it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She is right. That being said, she did not handle the situation well. To battle trolls, you must be strong and not care what they have to say. She showed weakness and they ate her alive. Of course it was not right but she was clearly not cut out for the position she had. 
 
I run an assistance subreddit here. I actually help people. And I am attacked on a daily basis by the trolliest trolls of them all. But I don't let them bother me. In fact I rarely even reply to them. The trolling is out of hand but the last thing in the world you can do is to let them know they are getting to you. If you do, you are history. </TEXT>

You can run around and shout 'murica until your face turns red white and blue. But the the facts and statistics has us in 30th, 40 and 50th place in the all the important factors. Those are called facts. And it is why America has fallen into such lows as it has never experienced because we refuse to see facts. Instead folks like you wave the flag and say we're number one!

<TEXT> http://ktla.com/2015/07/13/gas-prices-climb-above-4-in-l-a-after-13-cent-jump-overnight/

Read the article and it shows:

 Prices have jumped some 50 cents on average in the L.A. area since last week, according to AAA.

The gas station by my house where I usually get gas was $3.19 a gallon last week. Now it is $3.89. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I see gas prices rise 50 cents a gallon overnight, I have to ask who is controlling this crap? What excuse are they using now? 

Refinery problems? Employee strike? Or some other lame excuse that they pull out of their ass.


Edit: Must just be in So Cal.
No matter what problems we have had in the past, never have they risen  50 cents overnight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do you allow your subreddit be used to carry out people's personal witch hunts? I have seen happen many times. I have had it happen to me several times. People who want to carry out a grudge, will use your sub as tool to do so. What measures do you implement to stop such abusive tactics. They present flimsy hearsay evidence and pounce on the accused person who has no chance in hell to defend himself.

Or is this just a free-for-all witch hunt subreddit?

<TEXT> Yea all of that is horseshit.



* Overall health care costs are rising at historically low rates. 

* Premiums in the marketplaces aren't rising quickly, and more insurers are jumping in to compete.

* Employer premiums also aren't rising quickly. 

* The net effect on the budget has been to reduce the deficit.

* More people have health insurance.

* People who are getting health insurance are almost certainly better off.

<TEXT> I did my best to find out what happened once I returned from vacation. What was said came straight from the administrators. But regardless there has been nothing else said by anyone here that is more than hearsay. 

We know for a fact now that the head mod there demodded everyone and wrote that letter to the administrators. And this occurred well after sue left there. How else can we prove that something that was not said, was not said?

And even  regardless of all of that, even it was the case, the head mod performed the action. If any mod closed down a sub because one person talked them into it, they should have never been a mod in the first place. It's like committing a murder and then claiming that someone told me to. That makes zero sense. </TEXT>

As you can see,  the head mod demodded everyone and wrote a letter to the administrators. This occurred long after sue had left the subreddit. The evidence presented came from the administrators. 

That is the only evidence provided by anyone here. Everything else was just people repeating speculation by an anonymous person no one seems to know the identity of. 

I remember vouching for people long ago. It was a huge mistake. I was right hundreds of times but the few times I was wrong cancelled that out. So we never do that anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually everyone in this whole thing didn't know jack shit. I went and investigated it and found out what happened. Not from just one side. I asked the administrators what happened. They told me. And I posted their comment here.

Everything, everyone said here was pure speculation and based on hearsay. I am the only one who presented actual sound evidence. 

As for mods asking for anything, they would have less chance to get help here than a known scammer. None of them would dare even try. I don't recall vouching for anyone for a very long time. I  saw the shit storm it could cause so I ceased to do that anymore. We even now have a stated policy in our sidebar that does not allow us to vouch for anyone:

* MODS ARE NOT JUDGES - WE DO NOT JUDGE WHICH REQUESTS ARE WORTHY

That has been in effect for some time now. Mistakes were made in the distant past but we definitely learned from them. It is unfair to equate that with the current situation.

And just to let you know, Sue has been the reason I haven't quit here a long time ago. Many times I was on the brink but sue got me to see clearly. Sue is the reason this place has not gone by the way side long ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So all of this is predicated on a suspicion. How is one supposed to disprove a suspicion. The actions taken were that of one person. If i shut this place down, I would take responsibility, regardless of what any said to me. 

Excuse me saying this and I mean no disrespect to redditnoobie. But if one person could make me shut down my subreddit, then I have no business running the thing in the first place. If I were to shut this place down, blame me and only me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She thought she knew why, you thought you knew why. No one knew what the head mod had done until now. The question about why it happened was asked in our subreddit. She answered the question as best as she could with what knowledge she had.

And I kind of agree that there is zero proof either way, except that we know the head mod demoted everyone and sent that letter. We know that was not sue who did that.

So you say it is okay to call her guilty with no real evidence. But it is not okay to claim innocence on the same basis. 

This whole thing is predicated on an imaginary conversation that an anonymous person claims was made. That is what I call zero evidence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't say that was the reason all the mods left. I gave the other reason too:

  Others leave because they do not like that I don't allow harassment of users in the posts, I will not impose account age limits again and that i remove comments that are in a harassing nature. Some were very frustrated with me for that. But I stand by my policy that people will not get trolled here. Instead they can report any suspicions to the mods. Some mods did not like that policy at all.

As far as I now that is why the others left. There were no hard feelings, only a difference of opinion.

As for glinda being banned or when it comes to anyone being banned, I take all the responsibility for those actions. And we was after a discussion with the other mods. But I take final responsibility for any actions. I honestly do not see why that is an issue relevant to this conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> None of these things are the issue here. You claim it was sue that got it shut down. That is not the case. Of course she wasn't happy there. That is why she left. But instead of blaming the person who shut it down, you blame sue.

This is based on a supposed conversation that no one has heard or even knows occurred. Some one please tell me, who was the original person that made the claim this conversation occurred? I mean the only thing used to claim sue had a part in this, is this one imaginary conversation. Who is the person that is claiming that conversation occurred? And why is it being assumed as true. The only basis for blaming sue is an imaginary conversation from an anonymous person.

We too here want to get back to helping people. That is why we are here. I would love to put this behind us. That is why I made this post. </TEXT>

How do you have evidence of a conversation that never took place? After all you are predicated the guilt on Sue all on the basis of this imaginary conversation no one has heard or even knows exists. And even if it did, Sue did not take the action. It's like blaming sue for a murder someone else committed based on someone claiming there was an imaginary conversation beforehand.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Number one, we are not a charity. We do not take in donations and distribute them to others except in very rare cases. Glinda is not banned. But she was briefly because she was spreading untrue things about us and trying to take down our subreddit. That kind of person has no business in our subreddit. But after thinking about we changed our mind.

Why do moderators leave here? Some leave because of witch hunts like this that scare them away. It's not worth the trouble. Others leave because they do not like that I don't allow harassment of users in the posts, I will not impose account age limits again and that i remove comments that are in a harassing nature. Some were very frustrated with me for that. But I stand by my policy that people will not get trolled here. Instead they can report any suspicions to the mods. Some mods did not like that policy at all.

We are currently working on a revamp  of the sidebar. I agree it is atrocious. Our rules are not made clear. The new one will have bots that hit people over the head with the rules. That part is my responsibility and I have been working on it. I have some tech people creating a new format now.

There is not a new rule that prevents mods from asking for help. But any mod here would be crazy to make such a post. None has in quite awhile. We are people  and have crisises too. I have asked my mods long ago to run them by me first and that they never distinguish a request. We do have posts stickied every now and then, that are part of a campaign to help others. Not the mod personally. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In response to the recent post in r/subredditdrama: To those of you who like the truth about why r/food_pantry shut down. Hear it straight from the administrators </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-10 02:32:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A recent post here claimed that /u/sueolsen was responsible for shutting down r/food_pantry. I was away on vacation and did not get a chance to properly address it.

The truth:  Uttered bull crap

I did some inquiring to find proof since I was not associated with it but here is what the administration said:

-------------

 [A] to /r/Assistance/ sent 5 hours ago

 Wanted to reach out and see if things have calmed down a bit. Since there seems to be some confusion, the head moderator at food_pantry demodded the others and shut the subreddit down. He or she sent the following modmail, which nobody saw since they were all demodded a few minutes later:

 Hi guys. It is with a hollow heart that I wish to announce that I will be closing /r/food_pantry down for good. The last 4 years has been one hell of an adventure. There have been so many people helped through this subreddit, but I can't in good conscience, sit around and wait for it to be corrupted by the admins. I watched /u/kickme444 [+1] grow an amazing community only for reddit to hijack it and turn it into the monstrosity it is now. What was once a wonderful community about giving to others within the community has turned into a circle jerk about bringing in money through the Reddit marketplace or promoting reddit through the world records. And it's not just redditgifts, reddit is not the site it was 4 years ago when I created this sub. All the censoring and shadiness... I would rather remember the sub that I created while it's still what I created, than what it could be if the admins decide to wedge their grubby hands on it and find some way of squeezing money out of her, while squeezing us out.
I appreciate you all so much. I will forever look back on this time fondly 3 I hope you all understand my decision.

 The TL;DR is that there isn't any indication that you or anyone else had anything undue going on. The other mods there are probably just confused since all they know is they got demodded and the sub got closed.

------

The truth is Sue was tired of the people getting bashed there so she quit  as a mod. That was the end of her association there. The subreddit closed months later, long after her association with it. She had nothing to do with it. 

I am here to field your questions as long as they are done in a civil manner. We are tired of the drama but felt you deserved to know the truth and for Sue be exonerated. </TEXT>

I posted about this before:

But now we are looking for something more permanent for them. They have good jobs, are good people and just need a place **immediately** to move into. We have the proper funds but need something affordable and right away.

Please help me find this family a place. They are currently in a hotel and need something to move into now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the clerk's office had another person that would issue the license there all the time, that would be fine. But that is not the case. These people are being told they have to go to another county. As long as the service is provided, then it would be up to the office there to decide if they want to keep her. But many places are not going to hire two people to do the job of one.

And with the McDonald's analogy, if the employer wanted to hire someone knowing that they would just do fries, that would be up to the employer. Not the employee. </TEXT>

 Its a deep-rooted conviction; my conscience wont allow me to do that, Davis said Tuesday. It goes against everything I hold dear, everything sacred in my life.

Well that is fine and dandy. I have no problem with that honey. But you obviously have to get a new job then.

They will arrive in the state tomorrow and hopefully one of these leads will pan out. If not they may have to so what you suggest. Having the four girls will prove difficult. they can't leave them in the woods while they go to work. But we are working on a solution.

And by-the-way:

Happy Cakeday!

<TEXT> I am the head mod over at r/assistance where we help people in amazing ways due the the awesomeness of reddit..


Currently we have a family, one that is very dear to me and I will vouch for wholehearted. Actually it is one of my long time mods who has helped hundreds of others. The husband and wife worked at the same place and long story short they lost their jobs due to a very unruly owner.

The two have both found new jobs in Biddeford. They start Friday. They have packed up all their belongings and are currently in Vermont heading that way. But they have no place to stay. I have found arrangements for them and their four girls, and two small dogs as of July 7th. But they need a place to stay until then. Even someone's backyard. 

They start their new life but need help with a place to stay for the week so they can go to work. The last thing we want is for them to screw up on the new job. It was a magnificent break for them both to get jobs there.

Again these are good people and they just need to get through this tough time. For now, all we need is place for them to stay this next week. Maybe somewhere in Biddeford, Alfred, or Saco.

They really need your help. Please open your hearts and help me help them. I personally guarantee they are a good honest family. I am lucky to call them friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He seemed like a very nice guy and if he did a good job for you, I'm pretty sure he will do the same for me. Can't tell you how much trouble and money you saved me. Now all I have to do is empty my house of everything I own. (haha)

It will be worth it though. Cheers to you my friend. Let me know if you need some help in the future. I am not far away at all. :D </TEXT>

I can tell you I won't support Bernie though. And the reason is not him. It's you. 

A group made up of blind supporters who blather endlessly over every word he says and condemns anyone or anything that does not worship him,   is called a cult. Sorry Nancy, I'm not joining any cults today.

<TEXT> This article says:

 At least 5,500 Coloradans crammed into a Denver gymnasium, an adjacent atrium, and lacrosse field Saturday night to hear presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders speak, in what is being reported as one of the biggest political rallies so far in the 2016 election cycle.

Hillary rally had an estimate of 5,500 - 7000 people. 

http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/13/hillary-clinton-draws-biggest-crowd-2016-hopeful-nyc-rally.html

I have read three different numbers of the actual crowd but it was as large or larger than Bernie's. To say "one of the largest crowds" is very ambiguous and exaggerated on purpose.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had a bankruptcy ten years ago. I thought they only stayed on your record for seven years. I thought it might be advantageous to get a credit card just to try and rebuild my credit at my bank but I was turned down. Despite having 20 grand in my account for over a year now. The reason given was my bankruptcy.

Should that bankruptcy still  be on my record and do I need to take steps to get it removed? Any other tips on how to rebuild my credit would be welcome. I do not need the credit now. I just want it to be there should I ever need it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today's thought of the day comes in form of an observation from a fictional alien from the planet K-PAX (a great Kevin Spacey movie)


The alien from K-PAX told the psychiatrist we have no laws and no lawyers. When asked by the psychiatrist how do we know right from wrong the alien replied:

-----------------


**Every being in the universe knows right from wrong. Let me tell you something. You humans, most of you, subscribe to this policy of an eye for an eye, a life for a life, which is known throughout the universe for its stupidity. Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision; but nobody's paid much attention to them, not even the Buddhists or the Christians. You humans, sometimes its hard to imagine youve made it this far.**

<TEXT> A Colorado program  deemed the most successful in the country which provided birth control for teens, reduced teen pregnancy by 40%. It also reduced abortions by 35%. Republicans just voted to defund that program.


I just don't get it. I respect your right to have an opinion. But these two positions seem so counter-productive to each other. You hate abortion so much, how can you be against something that reduces it so significantly?

<TITLE> What life insurance should I get? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a single 57 year old male and am thinking I should get some life insurance. Nothing extravagant. Do you have any recommendations? 


Additional information: I don;t really understand what type and how much I should get. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I need to get it. It just seems like something I should have. I make a modest income and can't afford to pay a huge amount. But if it is something I should have, I am willing to put some money toward it each month. Sorry for my lack of knowledge on this subject. Your expertise is what I am seeking.

I own a mobile home but not the land. I rent that.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After some 40 years of smoking, I have come to use cigarettes as kind of a reward system that gets me through my work day and home life. 

Finish this and I can go have a cigarette, do 30 more of these and I can go have a cigarette, get through 30 more minutes of this and I can go have a cigarette, etc. etc. etc.

When I attempt my quit, I know this will be a **MAJOR** issue for me. I could use some food but we all know what that will lead to. I don't want to gain a lot of weight. 

I need some others rewards to pacify and motivate me to get through my day. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

--------------

Edit: Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster. The entire episode they make Chef's dad out as some looney who imagines everyone disguised as the Loch Ness monster asking for tree fiddy. But in the very last scene we find out that he wasn't imagining it. Watch the episode again and you will see. Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster.
Here is the script from the episode. Look at the last line. The optometrist asks Eric for three fifty.

<TITLE> A Simple Guide To The Iranian Nuclear Deal </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-04 17:22:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 	Two types of nuclear weapons material: Uranium, which is mined. And Plutonium, which produced.

	Uranium needs to be about 90% pure to work in a nuclear weapon and only 5% for a power plant

	They have been enriching it to 20% - The agreement is that will stop  and they will only enrich it past 3.67% for 15 years

	They currently have 2200 pounds of the 20% enriched. They have agreed to give up 97% they already have.

	It is enriched by centrifuges.  There are two types. 

	One is designed in the 70s which runs on very old outdate software comparable to an Atari game.

	The other is a high tech version that is much faster   efficiently  Iran has none and will not be allowed to have any of these.

	Iran currently has 19,000 of the old inefficient type.

	The deal specifies this number be reduced to 6,000. And only the old and inefficient ones

	Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges. But not produced or possess them.

	 Two ways to make plutonium: 

	Spent fuel rods used in enriching uranium can be used to make plutonium. Iran does not have this reprocessing ability. The deal specifies they cannot seek to gain this knowledge or ability and bans such processing plants.

	The second way is a reactor that is specifically designed to produce it. Iran currently has one such reactor that is not yet operational. 

	The deal specifies this core from this facility be  destroyed or removed from the country 

	Anything produced from this facility is required to be shipped out of the country.

	The other underground facility would partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb.

	This was one of Israels biggest concerns 

	Unprecedented levels of inspections including on site inspectors, camera and Seals. Uranium is tracked from the time it comes out of the ground, through the processing until it is stored in cylinders. Ability to see what they are importing and exporting. Inventory control.

	Inspections anywhere in the country that could investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility. (details still be worked out)

	The issue of when the sanctions are to be removed still looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30.

	UN Security Council resolutions on Irans nuclear program will be lifted simultaneously. A transparent procurement channel will be established, allowing Iran to get what it needs for civilian nuclear development while giving assurances to the world that the materials will not be diverted for non-peaceful use.

	 International cooperation to help Iran in research and development.

<TEXT> So that our subscribers will have the benefit of your wisdom and knowledge at their fingertips, We here at /r/assistance have decide to compile list of resources in one handy place to put on our sidebar.

So each week we will ask you to share all your resources for one specific area.

This week it is: 

#PET CHARITIES

We have many posts for the critters that can make our life worthwhile. 

We ask that you include the following:

* **Name of the organization**

* **A link to the site**

* **The specific area it serves** (city, county, state or country)

   We'd like to get resources around the world

* **The service it provides**

Please be concise so we can put these resources in a neat and easily accessible form. Please follow us in the coming weeks as we ask for resources in other areas that are needed on a regular basis. Next week it will be for the HOMELESS. 

Let's make this the most thorough list we can. Thanks for all your help

-------------------

**Edit: Please write it in this format to make it easier to compile and list later:**


* Name of Organization 

* Link to the site

* Service provide

* Area served

This will make it much easier for me to list when I do the compilation.

<TEXT> Getting older changes a guy, President Barack Obama says, and he admits he's getting crankier.

"Next week I'm signing an executive order to get off my lawn," Obama joked Saturday night at the Gridiron Club and Foundation's annual dinner. On top of that, the nation's graying chief executive says he's having trouble now with his morning cup of joe. "Coffee really disagrees with me these days," he says, "which is why John Boehner just invited coffee to address the joint House." </TEXT>

<TEXT> AT T has pissed me off for the last time. I could go for paragraphs about how they keep raising my prices. I just want a place that I make a deal and they stick with it. I hate having to call and argue every four or five months.

I checked out Verizon, and they seem to have a decent deal but I fear all the same BS tactics of AT T. Are my fears justified. 

Do they have good service? Do they stick with their contract? Do they play games?

Would appreciate your opinions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> We now have a "NEW Registered User" flair to identify requests being made by new accounts </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-31 07:11:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You may notice our **New User Registered** flair featured in red. This means the request is being made by an account younger than 60 days old.  We strongly suggest you take extra precautions and try to find ways to apply help more directly rather than sending cash.

We hope this tool will assist you in making more informed decisions. 


----------------------

**Other tips and tools to promote safe giving:**


* **APPLY ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY WHEN POSSIBLE!!!**  We highly recommend you pay the bill or buy the item instead of sending the money to the OP - This assures  money is going where they say it is** (EX: If someone is asking for help with a utility bill, pay that bill rather than giving the OP money)



* **ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING GIVING** - Dont be reluctant to ask  OP personal questions by PM - You wouldn't give a perfect stranger  help without  asking them a few questions - If the OP is reluctant to supply the information  by PM,  we recommend you do not give - It is up to the OP to supply you with the comfort and proof you desire and require - Get this information **BEFORE** you give!!!

* **This does not give anyone the right to  harass someone or subject them to a public trial:** - Be polite and respectful and do not make unfounded accusations. You do **not** have the right to put someone on trial - If you have concerns, contact the mods and be prepared to present proof

* **USE COMMON SENSE:** Take a moment to gather information about the requester. - Look at their overview page and history -  Gather any information  needed to pursue someone if they do not live up to their end of the bargain before you supply  assistance - Once you have given, you will not have that opportunity


----------------

**EDIT:**

* * As pointed out bt our moderator u/rhubey,  if you help someone by paying a bill for them, talk to someone from the billing department or customer service to make sure they do not keep your card information on file as the default payment card. This will avoid your card ever being used again by accident or even on purpose. Thanks you rhubey for this excellent advice. </TEXT>

There are about 12 people who have full access. I believe one of them is deleting entries that they shouldn't be. I would like to find out who and the information they have been deleting. 

If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My 92 year old mom became very ill a few months ago. She did not eat for a month and didn't even recognize me much of the time. My family and I had pretty much figured it was only a matter of time. 

Figuring it was her last Christmas, I asked you all to card bomb her:




* http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/2p172o/request_may_i_ask_a_huge_favor_from_everyone/

You did not disappoint. Slowly I saw improvement in her as I brought new cards in every time I visited. She loved them. She showed them off to others. Soon she began reading them herself. I saw the mom I once had, slowly regaining strength, eating, carrying on a conversation and she finally stopped calling me Pete (my name is Wayne).

But the incredible thing I saw today is she walked about six feet. It may not sound like much, but for me it is a miraculous. 

I know I asked you all just to make one last Christmas special for a very special lady. But you may have actually given her another Christmas as well.  You have provided her a will to live and to reason to fight. I wish I could send you all a personal thank you but there were just too many cards. But know together you did something I had given up on. 

Thank you all and may you actually get the opportunity to send more cards next Christmas. :D

P.S. Whoever sent the dancing polar bear card and the snowman with the shaking butt card, you really have provided more laughter and happiness than you could have ever expected. She still shows them to me when I visit. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I run /r/Assistance    and you guys have helped us sooooo much. Yes_it_is_weird has really done some great work for us. I know he is busy so I didn't want to bug him again.

People request help in our subreddit and we want our subscribers to be aware of when a request is being made by a new user so they can use extra caution.

So we are looking for a bot the reads the age of the OP's account and gives it a special flair if it is a newer account. We would of course want that flair to disappear after a certain amount of time. 

Is this a possibility and is there anyone that might help us implement this?

<TEXT> Deleting requests is a bannable offense. 

Sorry to sound harsh. We have just had a rash of this tactic being used lately. We try to be nice and give out warnings. We do not like to be dicks. But there are a few who are abusing that.

If there is a special reason you want it removed, contact the mods and they will do it for you. Then there is no suspicion or no problem.

<DATE> 2014-12-16 04:46:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm facing all sorts of adversity right now. Whether it is health, being able to afford to live, being able to work, and just being able to live for another day. It is all happening at once. Without a family to run to and without any remote friends that can lend a hand in the way I need, I am facing extreme calamity. Possibly death.


Everything that I'm going through is because of a mystery illness that I was faced with a couple years ago. It's gone to far to the extent where I really need help, especially since a recent accident that happened a couple months ago. I can't walk. If I must, I have to wear leg braces. I can't walk because of my arthritic and ligament problems, which was caused by the illness that spread throughout my entire body to cause all of these things. It doesn't help that I was training and working out a lot during my time in the Marine Corps. It's caused me constant bleeding throughout these past couple of years. Lately, and for the first time this year I have lost feeling in both of my feet and legs. It's starting to spread upwards on my leg. I've fainted numerous of times just from being too sick. I've found myself passed out in the bathroom floor or in the hallway. I've fainted in the hands of professions in the hospital, as well. I've had to deal with tons of research done to me. Seen tons of medical professionals. None have been able to really help me or conclude what possibly happened to me. I haven't gave up despite all of my problems.


I'm ultimately needing 20K for treatments. I'm living in an apartment without any bed (I've been sleeping on the floor) and my tent has been due ($1,445 for November and December). I'm about to get an eviction notice. My apartment complex wants to kill me. It is winter time. I'm on my last $30. To say that I just need $20K for treatments wouldn't be enough. My treatments can take 1 and half to 2 months total. This is from a doctor that I know can make me better. I'm really ashamed and feel like I'm asking for too much already. But, I already exhausted all the possible resources I can and whatever anyone can give me as advice. I can immediately start working after this and finish my schooling. 

* www.gofundme.com/gilvx4


I'm the review of what I ultimately ask, please consider my statements hereforth.

Does someone chose to get sick? Or is it someone else's fault to get sick? I have been blamed for both. I feel at fault and at my wits end. I feel like I have asked from the VA (Veterans Affairs), to the government, to my friends (and "friends") and to my connections to no avail. I am at your full mercy to pick me up. To give me a chance, again. Not to run and to sloth at this given opportunity, but given a chance to make a difference. A difference that I know I can do and promise. To give back.

If you need any proof, questions, or concerns, please let me know. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Backpackwayne's mom has really gone down hill in the last couple months. I have had to face reality and accept that I will lose my mother soon.




The last couple months I've watched my mom, who is the epitome of kindness, waste away to what look to be her final days. She didn't eat anything for the last month.



But this last week I bought a new TV for her hospital room just to give her some kind of stimulus. I never dreamed it would spark her will to live like it did. She has started to eat again and can once again carry on a limited conversation.

Well I thought if something like a TV could do that much good, Just think what would happen if we flooded her with hundreds of cards from arounf the world. Even if it didn't have that effect, it would be wonderful that in her final days she knew  that the world was still thinking of her.

**Please, everyone send her a card.**

She likes cards with cute babies and kids and loves the funny stuff too. She is no prude. So feel free to send risque stuff too. Just make her smile.

If there was ever something you could do for me, this would it. I want my mom's final days to as happy as I can make them.

Please PM for the address.

Thank you everyone 

And spread the word elsewhere if you can. I want to shower her with all the cards and love I can.


-------------------

Thank you everyone. Over 250 cards and it has really brightened up my mom. She is actually carrying on a conversation. She just loves it. Words can not express my appreciation. Bless you everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /r/SantasLittleHelpers grants Christmas wishes to redditors around the world. We are a little short on givers right now. To attract them I bought an **Emerson 32"  TV** to give away in a raffle. Every gift someone gives, they get a ticket for the raffle.

We really need to spread the word about this.

**I'm asking if any of you would allow me to make a post in your subreddit.**

<TITLE> How will our president be remembered in the history books? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-31 00:43:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently read this quote from our president:

 A few timid people who fear progress, will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing. Sometimes they will call it fascism; sometimes communism; and sometimes socialism. 




 But in so doing, they are trying to make very complex, something that is really very simple, and very practical. 


--------------

And I read what they say about him:


* People everywhere are growing impatient.  On the right  organized by some of the most powerful industrialists charging that the presidents actions are only making things worse.

  That the president has become a dictator, defying the constitution, encouraging class warfare. Saying the president is hell-bent on socialism. There can only be one capital, they say; Washington or Moscow. There can only be one flag. The stars and stripes, or the flag of the godless Soviets. His enemies only referred to him as that man in the White House. Because they cannot bear to say his name. 

  On the left socialist and some communist took to the street denouncing the president as a captive of capitalism; incapable of bringing about real change.

---------------------

Hearing this makes me wonder what they will say about Obama in the history books in the years to come.

What are your thoughts about what they say now and do you believe he will be remembered differently or just like what the say now? I mean has any other president been so hated at the time, ever end up being considered a great president after all the smoke clears or is Obama stuck with the hatred forever? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been negligent in sending out thanks for all the support and cards you have sent me and my 92 year old mom. She laughs and smiles when I bring her the cards. It has been rough but all of you have made things more bearable.

It's amazing how the support comes from every corner of the world. I just can not express my appreciation in this challenging time.

She is still in the care facility and her mental capacity has returned. But physically she is still extremely weak. We are hopeful that she will keep getting stronger and eventually may be able to bring her home.

Your support means everything to both me and her. 

Thank you. Thank you so much.

<TEXT> The time has come and in this last crucial week /r/democrats will be dedicated solely to election issues and getting out the vote.

The only reason democrats lose in the midterms is because of voter turnout. 

**It's time to get off our asses and rally our base to make their voices heard.**

Many important contests are in a virtual tie. We can make a difference if we just get out and vote.

And don't tell me your vote doesn't count. That is the lamest excuse I have ever heard. It counts now more than ever.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm late at sending out thanks to you all. Mom got really sick and has been in the hospital this last week. Up until today it did not look good. Her mental state was gone. I was fearing the worst.

But today when I visited her, she was back. She was asking questions and  her mind was obviously back. I brought the cards you sent for her birthday that are still coming in and she loved them. From Germany, New Zealand, cities throughout the US, Australia and so many other places. She was reading them and smiling. Medicine that could not have come from anywhere else and it was working great.

Thank you all for keeping my mom happy and alive. Say some prayers that her recovery continues. Bless you all! :D </TEXT>

**CutieJudy's  Project:**

**[Check it out here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2hjfr3/help_some_people_in_nursing_homes_this_holiday/)**

There are many people who are in Nursing Homes that are not Seniors Citizens , But cant take care of theirselfs because they are handicapped .The sad part is most of their families passed away and there was no one else to look after them. They need everyday items, like soaps, shampoo,lotion , socks, slippers, underwear   person body care items.. I hope to post a Amazon/Walmart wishlist. I am also going to be collecting new   used items. If anyone has any other ideas to share that will be great. . Thanks again. : )

<TITLE> Out-extreming the extremists - Or my day at my mom's birthday party. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-15 04:55:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today I went to my sister's house for my mom's birthday. I kind of hate going to stuff like that because I always have to hear all that right-wing extremist crap. I mean they make FOX News look liberal. Especially my evil brother. The ignorance that comes out of his mouth is excruciating. I gave up long ago trying discuss anything with him.

So they are going on and on about the football player that beat his wife and the black guy that got killed in Ferguson and somehow made it about how unfair they were being to white people. How they got there I will never know. I was just biting my tongue but finally mentioned Zimmerman. The conversation went on without my participation but it was just so vile and ignorant. Talking about how unfair Zimmerman was treated and what a piece of shit the kid that got killed was. And how the black guy that got killed in Ferguson ruined that cops's life.
After several minutes of listening to this garbage, I finally just stood up and said:

"Yea..., those fucking niggers!"

Everyone just went silent and gasped. Even though for the last 20 minutes, that's what they had been basically saying. They thought it was horrible how I paraphrased it for them. They were not happy with me today. But I was giggling to myself how I actually out-extremed the extremists. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need someone to make an instructional link on how to make a Amazon wishlist for our Christmas subreddit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-09 07:08:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A really nice redditor provided us with this link on how to add an address to your Amazon wishlist. It was soooooo helpful. It saved the mods so many headaches trying to explain to people how to do that. They made it in pictures that was so simple anyone could understand it. Check it out:

* https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

What we really could use is the same thing that explains how to make an Amazon wishlist from scratch. It would be aimned at people who are not good at computers and have never made an Amazon wishlist before. Come Christmas we are running both subs and it is an insane amount of work for us. Explaining the wishlist consumes way too much of our time. The format with the pictures like the one above would be most preferred. 

Is there anyone who would be willing to make this for us? 

P.S. Christmas is closer than you think. :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I promised to buy a needy Canadian some coffee. But every frickin' place I try to order it from will not send it to Canada  from the US. It doesn't have to come from the US. It can be sent from Canada to Canada. I just have to pay for it from the US.

Not looking for anything fancy. Just some plain old regular coffee. I've been trying for hours with no success. It's such a simple thing but is turning into a major hassle. Can you give me an online site that will allow me to send this poor woman some coffee?

<TEXT> I run /r/santaslittlehelpers where we require requests to include am Amazon wishlist. We spend so much of our time coaching people in how to make a wishlist. Some of these users can barely send an email. It is so frustrating and time consuming for us.

We of course had the problem of them not adding their shipping address until a very kind redditor gave us this link to show them how:

*https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

It really helped out. Now we are looking for the same kind of thing that explains with pictures, how to make a basic wishlist.

Is there one in existence or would someone be willing to make one for us? 

Our subscribers last year provided over $20,000 of gifts from Amazon to those in need so you could see how frustrating it gets instructing so many to make a basic wishlist. To have a link we could give them that would explain it in the simplest of terms, with pictures like the link above, would be awesome beyond awesome.

Anyone out there know of one or would be willing to create one? </TEXT>

If so, what would make this case different than the other ones he targeted. If not, do you think he should be powerless if he can't get at him to bring back to America for trial? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does your vote count? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-21 21:52:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes. In fact your votes are the only ones that matter.
Elections are not decided by republicans or democrats. Their votes basically cancel each other out. They sway from one side back and forth, but rarely are the deciding factor.

In most presidential elections, the percentage difference is around 5%. If all the people who say their vote doesn't matter would vote, then they would matter. They would easily sway the vote one way or the other. The direction our country takes can easily be changed by a small percentage that does not vote. The very people who say their vote does not count.

**In practical reality, your votes are the only ones that do count.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

I'm train_subject8344 of r/assistance. Each Christmas we provide tens of thousands of dollars worth of toys and presents to redditors around the world in our sister subreddit: /r/SantasLittleHeplers.

Right now the place looks like it was designed by a serial killer. I mean it is terrible. We want it to scream Christmas. Right now the only thing it screams is I don't have a clue how to of how to make a site look like Christmas.

We seriously want it to make it look like Santa had an acid trip there. So we are looking for someone to decorate the place up for us. Here is a real chance to show your creativity and help us bring Christmas joy to the world. Anyone feel like taking up the challenge? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something real slow and that uses simple chords. But real pretty when sung solo by a male? An old classic is preferable but not required.

It would be a toward the end song. You know when everyone is tired and ready to call it a night.

Almost like a lullaby type slow.

---------------------

Totally awesome suggestions. Keep 'em coming itf you would. Some of these may not be the ending lullabye but some that I will still want to work in.

But this is the song I think I'm going to go with. Tell me if you agree:

I do not want this subreddit to be a place where  responses to real problems are answered in pennies. But I admit I am totally ignorant to all of this.

What do all think about this? Please help me. I am clueless to all of this. Does this really offer any real assistance or is it just an insult to those in need? I know every penny counts but we are interested in real solutions, not making people beg for scraps. 

It may be a solution to a small sector of people who are into this but is it really something for the /r/assistance community?

Please give me your opinions and advice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After the McDaniel loss last night, I hear all this talk about how pissed the Tea Party is and how they want to split from the party. But as an outside observer,  I'm find myself confused and really can not tell the difference between the two. They have voted the same in all congressional votes. Basically no no and no and yes on Obamcare repeal.

I mean what is really the difference between the two. I just don't see it. One may talk crazier than the other but they both vote for the exact same things.

What is the actual  difference when it comes to how each of them vote or what they stand for?

I want to get it fixed but fear if I go to the dealer they will way over charge me for a simple job.

How would you smart guys here approach this problem. Or should I say how do you recommend someone like me approach it so I don't get over-charged hundreds of dollars for a simple problem?

<TEXT> Being the head mod of r/assistance, I have made it a policy, to make or endorse a request for anyone to avoid any conflict of interest.  But I am making a rare exception because one of our own needs us in the worst way. /u/baes is one of the nicest people I've ever met on reddit.
 
Last year in r/SantasLittleHelpers, I met him and he loved what we were doing and joined in to help in every way he could, even though he was undergoing chemotherapy for the cancer that invaded his life. 

We loved him so much, we made him a moderator in r/assistance and he instantly fit in, continuing the wonderful work he had done during Christmas. But his condition has deteriorated to the point he can barley see the screen anymore. We keep in touch because his wife reads my messages and helps him compose the ones back to me. 

It really saddens me how such a good guy is having to go through so much. And to make it worse, he and his family now face considerable financial troubles. I could go into them but lets just say they need our help in the worst way.

**THERE ARE TWO WAYS YOU CAN HELP**

**Make a donation of any amount at:**

* http://www.gofundme.com/9to2is




**Purchase an item off the wish list his wife has supplied:**

This wonderful man has helped so many. Now it is our turn to come to his rescue.  He really needs us. Please find it in your heart to help with **any** amount you can. If you have ever wanted to help someone, this is the guy to help.

I will start this off with a $100 donation. Let's make this one count. He is one of own own. And like I say, one of the good ones.

**And please and send him a message to let him know /r/assistance cares and what a great guy he is:**

<TITLE> Be able to send a mod message to a user that all mods can see and participate in </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-02 01:42:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Currently a user can initiate a modmail thread that all mods see and can participate in. 

But a mod can only initiate a thread other mods can see. We don't have the ability to include another user in that conversation. 

My reasoning behind this is when we have issues with a user, the mod has to send a personal message to them that only he and the user  see. It would be much more useful for all the mods to see and participate in it. That way all mods know what is going and can offer their input as well. 

It would really help keep the mod team on the same page and for the user to not be singled out by one mod.

I know it can be done. It is exactly what happens when you ban a user. A message is sent from whoever banned the user to the user and to modmail that all the mods and the user can see and participate in.

I think this would help both the mods and the user. Everyone wins.

Thank you considering it. :D </TEXT>

Just like when you ban a user, that thread appears under the mod that sent it, but all the mods can see it and participate in it.

This way when we have an issue we need to communicate to a user, all the mods will see it and can participate in it. Current we can only do that when the user initiates the thread.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When you ban a user, it starts a mod thread that all the mods can see and also the person you banned. You have a mod thread with the user and the mods.

Is there a way to initiate that type of thread from a mod so all the mods will be in on something when we send messages to a user?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I run /r/assistance and currently it is allowing users to submit linked posts. It never used to allow that. It is important to us that only text posts be allowed.

I have the box checked under subreddit settings to **text posts only.**

Yet it still gives users the option to make a linked post. We've been text post only for a long time now. I don't know how or why it is behaving this way.

Any guesses?

**Edit:**

Looks like timotab figured it out. It's only letting the mods do it. Thanks timotab! </TEXT>

I thought I would send something like flowers but I wasn't sure that would be appropriate. What do you think? Have any other ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is ATT the only cable provider blacking out the Kings/Duck playoff hockey games on NBCSN in the Anaheim area? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-12 22:50:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've talked with so many other people and no one but U-Verse subscribers in Anaheim (Fullerton) are being deprived of the game. This is the first time in LA sports history that two local teams are meeting head-to-head in a playoff and the most devoted fans are the only ones who don't get to see it. 

And the only reason is we made the mistake of having U-Verse. ATT has really screwed us big time. I've called them and can't even get an explanation. They say it's because it's on a local channel which is a lie. It was during the regular season but not for the playoffs.

And it's not like there should be some contract dispute that doesn't allow it. DISH, Direct, Time Warner and everyone else but U-verse people get it.



-------------------------------

**EDIT:**

After spending two days on the phone being given every excuse in the world and finally being told it is just blacked for me, and there were no options for me to get it..., for some reason I am now getting it. I think I was more frustrated by them not being able to give me a valid reason and telling me lie after after lie. But I am watching the game right now.

<TEXT> The series of the year is being blacked out on my TV (Fullerton, CA) and ATT says it's because they have not negotiated a contract with NBCSN. I think they are BSing me because I still get the channel but it blacks out just during the Kings/Duck game. I near yo folks in Los Angeles are getting it but we in Orange County do not? That does not make sense.

My question to you out there in LA, are you getting the games? And what city do you live in? I am hassling with them right now and need to know whether or not I am going to quit my service.

<TEXT> The Kings/Ducks hockey games have been blacked out for my area.

They are not blacking them out on Direct TV or Dish from what I hear. They are just being dick heads.

 

What in the heck is going on? This is ridiculous. This is the first time in history two LA sports teams are meeting each other in a playoff and we in the local area don't get to see it. Seriously I am really frustrated about this.

<TEXT> All of a sudden it takes a couple seconds for the keystrokes and mouse clicks to show up on the screen after I enter them.  I have done malware and virus scans. No help there. I have defragemented, and I still have all kinds of space left on my computer. It also doesn't register anything after I get six or seven characters ahead. So I have to type five ore six letters and then sit and wait for it to catch up. And even then some of the words I typed aren't there. 

It is extremely irritating.

<TITLE> 2" ABS drain pipe broke under the house where it meets the main 4" sewer line </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-05 08:12:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The pipe broke and left the inch or so that inserts into the female part of the main sewer pipe. It's flush with the the female sleeve. Here is the generic photo of the connection:

http://cloudfront.zorotools.com/product/full/1CNT9_AS01.JPG

It is a 4" to 2"

I would like to fix this without having to replace the piece above. I just need to get that one or two inch piece out of that fitting so I can put a new pipe in there. Someone  told me to chip it out with a screwdriver but I am afraid I will break the female part in the process.

Another person said there might be some kind of drill bit that looks like a spade that I can use to drill it out. I have no idea what it is called or if it even exists.

At this point I'm not sure how to proceed. I was hoping for some suggestions on how to chip or drill it out with more ease and without breaking the female part of the fitting. Or any other methods you might have up your sleeve.


----------------------------

**EDIT**

Off the advice of a redditor, I used a rubber tee with a clamp and it fit over the female part of the coupling.

It looked like this:

I had given the wrong size in my post but was still able to find a fitting that worked. It ended up being the 2" opening off of a 3 X 2 tee. But all that matters is it worked. Once again washing clothes without flooding the underneath of my house.

Thank goodness for reddit. :D

<TEXT> I have a wood shed, built several years ago resting on a cement slab. There are paver stones that go right up to it. In fact about and inch under. Water leaks under the bottom plate and gets the floor of my shed wet.  Is there a sealant I can buy that will stick to both the shed and the stone an will prevent water from leaking in:
