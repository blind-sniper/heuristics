<TEXT> If you can get it to the table a lot and you have the right group for it, **Sheriff of Nottingham** is a lot of fun and great value. But you *need* the right group for this. It's very dependent on people willing to play loose, get into the theme etc. It falls very flat if you don't.


For pure gaming, absolutely get **Castles of Burgundy**. It scales magnificently from 2-4, has tons of replay value and is loads of fun. Has some luck with the dice rolls but you can mitigate that with knowledge tiles and worker guys. I love the tactical feel at 2P of blocking your opponent and the more strategic feel at 4P of focusing/maximizing your own strategy first and foremost. All time classic.

2. You are correct, being an asshole and reading have nothing to do with each other. However, as I initially said, it's fairly obvious what OP was trying to say, without going out of your way to be a dick and take the sentence as literally as possible using his poor grammar. 

3. Even with OP's poor title, there is absolutely nothing that would imply causation of Shaggy being Arab-American "BECAUSE" the guy who voiced him was Arab-American. Literally nothing.

<TEXT> If a flag is (correctly) claimed, it cannot be unclaimed later because a tactics card would allow a wild or extend it 4 cards needed instead of 3. If the flag is claimed, it's claimed for good. Which is the reason for the "advanced" rule it offers in the instructions, that a player cannot claim a flag until the start of their following turn, so to allow a player to stop a flag from being claimed via a tactics card.

**Tokaido** is a very clean, attractive looking game.  

**Evolution** has beautiful, watercolor style art. 

In **Fresco**, you play as a master painter and it's a very good looking game. 

**Pictomania** is a pictionary-esque game so it's drawing based with a little bit more going on. Lots of fun.

<TEXT> I like Dead of Winter. My collection was almost all heavier euros, so I've been trying to round it out a bit to have something for all occasions, and getting some lighter games when the brain burn gets high. Which is why 1775 is so high on my favorites. It's definitely not Twilight Struggle. You're moving armies around the board and it's a ton of direct conflict with some dice roll (which is done in a really neat way). The 2v2 (you can also play 1v1 with each person controlling both armies on a side) aspect creates a great environment for the game. I love it. It's on the lighter side, it's not terribly long at all but it has great replay-value and a good amount of strategy and decision making. It's just fun.  </TEXT>

I had gotten into the hobby 4-5 years ago when my friend picked up Catan, and we played that to death over the next year. Then he found Puerto Rico and that opened the floodgates for our group. A couple years ago I picked up Dominion Intrigue and Agricola to start my collection. It's grown and grown from there. 

[On top]

* Core Worlds, Five Tribes, Trains, Blueprints and some party games: Time's Up!, Wits   Wagers Party and Pictomania. If you look veeeery closely you can also see Fortune   Glory hiding in there. 

[Top Shelf]

* Bohnanza, Race for The Galaxy, Babel, Splendor, Stone Age, Mr Jack Pocket, Takenoko, Settlers of Catan, Le Havre   1775 Rebellion.

[Middle Shelf]

* Dominion Intrigue/Dark Ages/Hinterlands/Guilds, Star Realms, Eminent Domain, Castles of MKL, Tzolkin, Dead of Winter


[Bottom Shelf]

* Last Will, Agricola, AquaSphere, Brass, Terra Mystica and Fire   Ice Expansion, Twilight Struggle, Bora Bora   a Trains map expansion



[My personal favorites!]

1. Terra Mystica

2. Le Havre

3. Twilight Struggle

4. 1775 Rebellion

5. Dominion

6. Eminent Domain

7. Bora Bora

8. Tzolkin
9. Agricola 

10. AquaSphere 



Five Tribes   Core Worlds are new purchases so I haven't gotten them to the table yet. And I already know I'll have to get at least one Core Worlds expansion. Brass was a January purchase but still hasn't made it to the table unfortunately. I have the Evolution + expansion   Mottanai Kickstarters coming in August (hopefully) so I'll have to get those played before the new ones come in. Fortune   Glory I just hate. Maybe it'd be more fun if I gave it more of a chance but there's just too much going on for me to make it fun for what it is.

<TEXT> I know this game gets a ton of love here, but it just falls flat with me. I bought it while aboard the hype train after its initial release, and have played it about 10 times since. The first couple plays were fun, but then it just never progressed. My biggest issue is that I never get a real sense of completion. The castles seem small at the end, and there tends to be AP by the master-builder which stagnates the game at times. Each play, I'm just underwhelmed after.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my lifetime I was roughly 0-6375463549 in playing Carcassonne against my friend John. Each game, played out like the last: my meeples scattered in unfinished castles, starving along roads to nowhere, slaughtered in fields outnumbered two to one. I'd watch his scoring marker danced along the track, circling and circling the board. Adding expansions only made the misery more prolonged, more insufferable. 


Yet I persevered. Then one day (oh this glorious day!), did the tiles fall into my favor. Square by square, I completed majestic, shielded castles. I built long, windy roads that had a beginning and end. I frolicked in the fields my opponent dared not enter. And I won. By the angels in heaven and the hammer of Thor, I won. 


With my new found confidence and Carcassonne prowess, we reset the battle field so I could take back to back victories. 


And I got killed.


But I will always have that one. That sweet, sweet one. Damn you, John.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First...I own Domion Intrigue along with Hinterlands, Dark Ages, Guilds and the rest of my group has the base, Seaside, Prosperity. I've played it a ton. Don't let some of the poor artwork blow the game for you. And to the theme nuts out there...who the hell cares. It's a game where you use the 10 kingdom cards available to get the most VP's. And it works beautifully. With the wealth of expansions (and cards in each expansion) the breadth of replay value is, perhaps, unmatched. It's an easy game to learn, and one that also has a lot of depth and strategy (see www.dominionstrategy.com for that). Dominion has reached the status it has because it is great.


Secondly, I also own **Eminent Domain**, **Core Worlds**, **Trains** and **Star Realms**. I guess I like deck builders. Dominion will always be my favorite, but I love the mechanics of Eminent Domain and Core Worlds. They each offer unique experience (Eminent Domain with role sections and followers, Core Worlds with invasion types, worlds, etc). You can't go wrong. The only downside to Core Worlds is that you really need the expansion(s) to make it a complete game so it turns into a $60 game. If theme is important for you, which it seems to be, Core Worlds offers, in my opinion, the best theme of any deck builder. 

Trains works well with theme as well with the enhanced mechanic of an actual board and pieces. It's pretty much Dominion with a board. You feel more of an experience like you're building a train line (even if it just little cubes). 

Star Realms is fun for up to 5-10 plays. 

DC deck builder is terrible.

<TEXT> **Alchemists** is a pretty heavy game. There's a lot going on there and the teaching/learning time is *steep*. It's a really great game, but if you're wary about dropping some heavy on your friends, you might want to wait on that. **Ca$h 'n Gun$** and **Mascarade** aren't really competitive. They're more just social party games and Mascarade offers some deduction elements. 


**Battlestar Galactica** plays well with 5P if you want to go the co-op/traitor route. Take a look at **Power Grid** for a classic medium weight that plays well at 5.  **Kemet** is a medium-light game that works great at 3-5. It's quick, action packed war game and not too hard to get into at all. You can even combine it with **Cyclades** which is super cool. And there's always **Cosmic Encounter** for a crazy good time.

Very historical, tactical, some card drafting (you have 12 cards, 3 in hand at a time), moving soldiers around Colonial US   Canada. Lots of fun. A bit lighter than your traditional war game. I think the 2 v 2 aspect is a fantastic option as well you don't see often.

<TITLE> [Strategy] My hog rider attack strategy questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-12 16:11:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> During clan wars, I've been using a hog attack strategy that seems to be pretty hit   miss lately. It's especially miss if there are inferno towers. I use 38 hog riders (max), 10 barbarians (max) and 25 archers (max). 


I typically send the hogs in at the same side side of the base, but slightly apart to form 2 close by fronts. For spells, I drop 4 heal spells for them throughout the attack. 


I run into issues if 1. there are inferno towers, they destroy the hogs. or 2. I get unlucky and hit a lot of traps. If the base also has a good amount of upgraded wizard towers or archers, that gives them problems. 


What could I do to tweak this attack to make it a little more viable and consistent? Thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **1775: Rebellion** isn't necessarily gateway, but it's actually pretty light and a lot of fun. It's basically a move and battle game with good tactics. And it's history based. The rulebook offers a lot of history behind the cards and events too which is great. 


**Pandemic** is a very popular game that is lighter and cooperative so can help with the community engagement. The dice version, **Pandemic: The Cure** is great too.


**Takenoko** is a great gateway game. Light, has some depth of strategy and is beautiful looking. It's one of very few games I can get my SO to play. Appeals to a large demographic.


**Bohnanza** is one of my favorites. Very easy to learn, social trading game. Lots of fun.


**Hanabi** is a great social game. Very cheap too. 


**Lords of Vegas** maybe. Just a fun game. Some strategy, but mostly just a fun, crazy time of building casinos, gambling and rolling dice. 


Some other party games like **Wits   Wagers**, **Time's Up!**, **Concept**, **Mascarade**, **Pictomania** and **Snake Oil** are all great options too. Tons of fun there.

edit: pandemic mix up

<TEXT> **Jamaica** might fit very well as a lighter option with all that heavy stuff your group. Quick, light, fun pirate themed game. 


**Archipelago** may fit the bill! Cooperative with secret objectives, it's a nautical/resource/economic management game. Lots of fun.


**Panamax** was just released to pretty strong reviews. Haven't played it myself, but it has ships that do ship things I guess. 


**Le Havre** technically has a port/nautical theme, and regardless of theme it's a phenomenal game.


**Amerigo** is a great Feld game where you discover new lands and develop trade routes etc. 


**Black Fleet** is also a lot of fun, and a little lighter if you want.

After Game 1 all I heard for Blackhawks was "the team that wins game 1 wins the stanley cup 284456% of the time." After Game 2 for Lightning, "the team that wins Game 2 has never allowed a goal ever again." After Game 3, "any team that has won Games 2 and 3 of Finals is automatically given the cup and enshrined in Valhalla for eternity."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't even break it up into sessions. You'd still have to sit through 2-3 hours of video to watch someone play a game. People won't do that. Even Rahdo trims his down to under an hour and then gives a separate link if you really want to watch the extended gameplay. Look at what TableTop does in a lot of their videos...at some point they typically have an 'In the interest of time..." cut montage. And in the normal span of the video, they've edited out down time in the gameplay.  </TEXT>

No one has ever woken up one day and said "I'd like to watch a two and a half hour still cam video of someone playing Smash Up."

<TEXT> All good games, but personally I'd absolutely lean to **Eclipse**, especially with 4x. It's a beautifully designed game. It scales well, you can feel the game escalate as you go, there are lots of different viable paths to victory. Battle is a lot of fun, and the alien races really help to further mix it up and add variety.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a sweet old card table. Great find. It's a card table so any kind of 4P trick taking game would be perfect...**Ticchu**, **Diamonds**, **Chimera** (3P). Small 2P games would be great too: **Jaipur**, **Targi**, **Battle Line**, **Hive**, **The Duke**, **Race For the Galaxy**.

Other 2-4P games that don't take up much room that I can think of quickly...**Blueprints**, **Dominion**, **Bohnanza**, **Love Letter** (or any micro game), **Forbidden Desert**, **Hanabi**, **Scrabble**, **King of Tokyo**, **King of New York**, **Spyrium**.

<TEXT> A lot of Stefan Feld games scale wonderfully well. **Castles of Burgundy** is fantastic at any player count. **Trajan** scales well too and to mix it up, different strategies work better at different player counts. I've enjoyed **Aquasphere** and **Bora Bora** a lot with various player counts too.

<TEXT> If you're asking for feedback...

* Just posting here and saying "Here's the link" doesn't show much effort or passion for your game


* Most importantly, the backer levels are insane. $20 or $35 just for a freaking digital image of the game?? What is that about? $50 for a game that looks like that? Seems high. Then another $100 **FOR TWO GLOW IN THE DARK DICE?!** WHAT?? $250 for a game, two dice and an autograph from someone that's never designed a game before?? And $750 for a glossy version?? At this point it starts to read and feel like a scam. 

I wouldn't touch this kickstarter with a 100 foot pole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Intrigue is the better game. Slightly more advanced cards, ~~more player interaction~~, a bit more depth to strategy and variety in the kingdoms. You won't go wrong either way, but I'd give an edge to Intrigue. 


edit: not more player interaction. I'm wrong. Taken from the Dominion Wiki...

 "Intrigue developed a somewhat unfounded reputation as a highly attack-heavy expansion: in actuality, Intrigue contains fewer Attack cards than the base set and fewer than the next expansion, Seaside. This reputation arises in part from the fact that the Attack cards Intrigue does have all have a reputation as particularly annoying attacks to get hit by (even the relatively weak Saboteur, which is unpleasant out of proportion to how effective it is), and in part because it has some non-Attack cards (Masquerade and Tribute) that affect players in ways that occasionally make them feel like they're being attacked." </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want a loose, fun, gambling type game check out **Lords of Vegas**. 

**Acquire** is an absolute classic. 

**For Sale** is about buying   selling real estate

**Last Will** is almost the reverse. Super fun game about blowing your inheritance as fast as possible.

**Merchant of Venus** may be a stretch, but in that you're playing space traders seeking the biggest fortune.

<TEXT> **The Duke** is a 2P game where you're moving tiles on a board, akin to chess. The only functional things you'll need to do is move a tile, flip a tile or pick a tile out of a bag. If she can't, you could do those for her. 


Can your wife at least pick little things up with 2 fingers? A lot of worker placement games might work. **Le Havre** (cards are laid out in front of you, not in hand), **Bora Bora**, **Manhattan Project**, **Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar** there aren't cards-in-hand involved; just moving/placing workers or goods.  </TEXT>

* Lastly and likely most beneficial, a [recent Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64ouncegames/board-games-now-blind-accessible/description) for **64 Oz Games** put out a product that helps (some) board games become blind accessible with transparent sleeves and custom dice. The campaign has completed, but they are [operating at their website](http://store.64ouncegames.com/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's much more interactive. Instead of just having 'Tokyo' as the board, the board is all 5 burroughs of NYC, and Manhattan acts as 'Tokyo.' If you're not in Manhattan, you have to be in one of the other burroughs, so everyone is always on the board. Each burrough also gets 3 stacks of 3 tiles that act as buildings on one side that you can knock over (the dice are different in KoNY). You can get points/energy/hearts for knocking them over but once you destroy a building, it releases military vehicles/tanks/planes that can attack you, so it litters danger for your monster all over the board (you can also defeat these with die rolls). 

It adds more strategic decisions besides just "to punch or not to punch" and "get points." It's great.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> With the track record of prior first time publishers having a lot of problems   delays (i.e. Two Rooms and A Boom) getting their game out once they receive a successful (or maybe more problematically, very successful) funding, how can use ease concerns one may have on your game? Do you have an infrastructure in place to meet foreseeable demands, especially with delivery dates listed as soon as August 2015. What does that production infrastructure look like? What if you double/triple/quadruple your goal? 


I wish you the best of luck!  </TEXT>

Also, I'd go KoNY over KoT. It adds a little more depth and strategy. 

From the rest of your games you want, it seems like you're looking at lighter, more social games. I'd check out **Sheriff of Nottingham**, **Small World**, **Forbidden Desert**, **Flash Point: Fire Rescuet**, **Bohnanza**.

I'd say 2P games would be less played if you have 4-6 people because it's more intimate, it feels slightly weirder to split into 2 groups.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well that's just not true. Look through this thread alone for evidence of that. And as a few people have pointed out, Roethlisberger was never even charged with anything. Just accused by a woman he had sex with in a bathroom. Sleevey? Definitely. Rape...maybe? no one will know at all for sure. And Lewis was charged with accessory, meaning he was there, but charges were dropped. Again, obviously not saying deflating footballs is remotely close to anything in the realm of rape/murder/DV. Which is the point. Pictures like these are trying to make the NFL look like they value both the same. And that's just stupid.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get your point for sure. I think it was the absolute perfect storm for him. There was a definite quiet boiling of public ire at the NFL for their treatment (or lack thereof) of players with records of domestic violence. Then Ray Rice in the elevator happened, with the added bonus of the smoking gun in the form of a video. That visceral evidence blows it out of the water. Can you imagine if tape surfaced of Mike Vick killing dogs? Or of Greg Hardy beating the hell out of a series of women? They'd have never set foot within a country mile of an NFL city. Ever. They'd have been burned at the stake. People don't forget when they see the evidence. 

The NFL completely underestimated this growing resentment and media interest in the Ray Rice case. They tried to cover up and give a weak pass to protect their brand and keep pretending they're a nice company with nice people. Then the public flipped out and the NFL had to conjure up "new evidence" that led them to suspend Rice indefinitely to appear tough on DV.  </TEXT>

Mayweather convicted and served jail time and absolutely everyone agrees he's a piece of shit. Roethlisberger: acquitted (make your jokes). Ray Rice: suspended from NFL indefinitely and still remains out of league. AP suspended last year for remainder of season. 

They all were either acquitted in trial or depositions, or served far worse punishments than anything Brady will get. And no one thinks these are comparable moral actions. Just stop with this crap.

Terra Mystica is my all time favorite game, especially if you're looking for heavier. For worker placement, I'd look at Manhattan Project, Stone Age, Lords of Waterdeep or Spyrium.

Also, it's not a two week notice when you say "immediately."


Edit: Seriously people on the "what's so hard to understand about the two weeks notice?" Take the title of her post out of the equation and look at the letter. Not a single time does she mention giving notice of two weeks. All she says is "immediately" at the end. As an employer, if I got this letter, I'd be surprised as hell to see this girl show up the next day.  </TEXT>

They say he's been fined 3 times prior. Apparently you only get 1 game per number of instance. What a joke. 

And it's a joke that the NHL takes into account injury. Players get injured in totally legal plays. Why don't those legal plays get suspensions if injuries are reasons to suspend? And plenty of players are incredibly not injured, like in this instance, or others like countless boarding penalties that could have resulted in devastating neck injuries. It's the ACT, not the result that merits the suspension.  </TEXT>

Let's say we lock up last place, then lose the lottery getting 2nd pick and Eichel...I'm worried that Murray throws some insane package out there to trade the 2nd pick, Reinhart other prospects/picks for McDavid. He seems to be one of the few that think the gap between McDavid and Eichel is pretty big. I don't think it's that huge...at least not bigger than what it would take to trade for him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Truly understand their needs

Drugs   alcohol is their needs? Systematic humiliation? Are you kidding me? You know you can actually talk to these people right. You can ask them what they need. Who in here is promoting the humiliation of homeless people? If someone is begging on the street with the sole purpose of extorting money for free booze   drugs, than they're systematically humiliating themselves. If you got off your inane libertarian pedestal you'd see that. if you asked someone what they want, and they said 'cigarettes,' ask why. Chances are if they're that honest, your perfectly picked exception, is probably accurate. If they say food, then you offer to buy it for them, and they say no, then they're lying and want drugs, not something helpful. Your argument isn't controversial. It's short-sighted and lacks any thought of actually engaging the person in conversation. You're just lazy and don't want to be bother finding out what the person needs, you just want to absolve yourself of any responsibility while up on your pedestal of moral disposition.   </TEXT>

And if you live somewhere that gets cold...scarves, hats, gloves, etc. Lots of cities are popping up with scarf trees or poles, where people tie scarves (or hats) to trees so the homeless can anonymously grab whatever they need. Donating these warm items and other daily essentials are some of the most important donations to shelters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because you're likely enabling a substance dependence/abuse disorder and not actually helping them get nourishment they may need? Because most chronically homeless have some sort of mental disorder; roughly 1/3rd of the homeless have very severe mental disorders. They're often not in a mindset to differentiate between what's good and bad for them. You may not give a shit if someone drinks themself unconscious or uses heroin, but don't act like you're doing it out of some sort of moral principle. You just don't care.

<TEXT> This isn't WTF. This is actually helpful information, albeit posed in a very dramatic manner. I've worked for NPO's focused on aid to impoverished and homeless, and done volunteer work for like organizations in my city. Do NOT give cash. The vast majority of the chronically homeless have mental disorders and substance abuse issues. Maybe they do want food, but when they walk into the 7-11 with your $5, you're damn right they'll see those 40's and buy a couple instead. If you want to do something right there for them, go into the nearest convenient store and buy them a hot meal or hot cocoa. Or find a local organization and volunteer or donate to them. and if you want to make sure the charity you're donating to is worthwhile, visit www.charitywatch.com, www.charitynavigator.com or www.givewell.com. 

Edit: I'm not sure if a lot of these responses saying 'homeless guy said fuck off or threw my food away when I offered' are trying to prove my point or argue against me. You are allowed to talk to them, and ask if they would like food and if so, what they can eat (being aware of allergies). If they say fuck off or no, then just keep on moving, they were only looking for free drugs/alcohol anyway.   ....   and thanks for the gold anonymous stranger! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never backed anything on kickstarter, so I'm not sure how it totally works with the add-ons. I'm looking at backing Trickerion, but I'm wondering if I need to. I'd love all those stretch goals...do stretch goals normally go into the production or are they exclusively to kickstarter backers? </TEXT>

Dad yells at him to not hit, 18 month old waddles over to Dad, and with a sad face puts his arms up to picked up. Dad picks him up, kid open hand smacks him in the face. 


Later that day he took the kids to a play place for kids. They have a big sandbox there. 18 month old would go around and throw sand at all the boys and kiss all the girls.

I was reacting to 1. the quote in the link trivializing and marginalizing soldier's emotions and reactions to war; and 2. on why the movie was and to what aspect of war it chose to focus on. I never said that war movies have no affect on their audience. That's an entirely different debate of whether that is a responsibility film makers should choose to bear or not. Similar to 'athletes have influence on youth, thus they should be required to act like a role model' whether that athletes cares to or not. Clint Eastwood wanted to make a movie about Chris Kyle's life. What people think when they leave the movie is up to them. But it's not wrong to make the movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Wrong people" is a completely subjective opinion. The director of this movie wanted to focus on what a soldier (who I'm pretty sure is an "actual" person) goes through, so he focused on exactly the right person. There are other movies that focus on the citizens of a war torn area. If you prefer those, that's fine. But don't say something is wrong or broken because it looks at an immensely and impossibly large scope through a specific lens to tell the story they want to tell.  </TEXT>

It's a movie. Soldiers enlist for many different reasons, and during their service, yes, things "make them sad" and a million other feelings as well. Humans enjoy seeing stories about the human emotion; at heart we are empathetic creatures, and are pulled to stories that pull that out of us. People like this "comedian" are infuriating.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Buffalo, NY so I have some insight. Buffalo has an insane amount of infrastructure to prepare for winter conditions. The city and each surrounding town has an incredible number of plows and salt storehouses. They can clear highways and main roads in no time. 2 feet of snow on a Tuesday night? Bet your ass you're going to school on Wednesday morning. 

Other cities just don't have the infrastructure for it and, just as devastatingly, people don't know how to drive in the conditions, which clog up roads so those few plows that do exist can't get through. It basically comes to cost for these cities: is it worth it to purchase millions of dollars of plows, storehouses, salt stock and pay workers for the 1 storm a year or every few years? Generally, no </TEXT>

Lemieux will be a solid 2nd or 3rd line power forward. Loves to hit and has good hands. 50 points and 120 PIM in 46 games in Barrie this year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Boston said the same for Seguin. He's doing ok for Dallas. 

And regardless of where you stand in the trade, if you think our GM and brass didn't do proper research when pulling off a trade like this, you're delusional. Is it a risk? Maybe. But "attitude" stuff is so overblown. Seguin got run out of Boston because he partied and supposedly had a bad attitude. If Kane scores 30 goals, I don't care where he travels to.  </TEXT>

Hurts to send away Armia   Lemieux, but that's been the plan all along. Acquire as many prospects and picks as possible and use those assets to trade for proven young talent and get as close to the top of the draft as possible. Elite talent wins.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** is loads of fun. I like it better than Suburbia as it's less fiddly without the population/income tracks   checking other peoples' towns. Plus the theme is great. Castles are awesome! And the Master Builder mechanic adds some nice depth and strategy to it. Easy to get to the table, easy to teach and fun to play for newbies or experienced gamers.


Of everything you listed, **Dominant Species** would be the hardest to get the table. It's heavy and a really long game. Can easily be 4 hours. 


**Terra Mystica** might be hard if people aren't into heavy games. This game is heavy. There are a lot of rules and sometimes they're a bit scattered in the rulebook. That said, it's #2 or 3 on bgg for a reason. It's a masterpiece of a boardgame. Everything works together wonderfully, it looks incredible and has loads of replayability.


**Machi Koro** is definitely light, but it is fun. If you get this, get the Harbor Expansion with it. It evens out some of the OP strategy. 


For Co-Op, you can't go wrong with Pandemic. It's a classic, and you can uprade the difficulty if you want to to make it more challenging. Same with lots of Co-ops.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been to Snakes   Lattes and their pub location Snakes   Lagers a bunch. Their set up, business plan and atmosphere is wonderful. And they are slammed. I live about 90 minutes from Toronto, so we usually try to make a day of it, show up first thing on a Saturday and game all day. By 2pm they're on a wait, and during peak evening hours it's probably a 2 hour wait. And the crowd is a very even mix of guys and girls. Gamers and social people. The social people are definitely the bread   butter, playing CAH, cranium and other party games. Their menu is limited, but it's good food. They do have a lot of games for sale (generally at full MSRP, but some were less). And I didn't really see anything for miniatures, but you could probably bring your own and play. They'll just charge you the regular $5 cover. We've brought a couple of our own games before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Battle of Tichu**

It was a bloodbath. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Every hand loaded with 5's, 10's or Kings was bombed by our opponents. We tried to go "Grand Tichu" to hit a home run comeback. It blew up in our face. We were lost; scrambling like lost puppies in a rainstorm. We were being laughed off the table. The score was 385 to -110...but while the final battle seemed upon us, the end was not quite as close.


The tide began to turn with The Hand. Like Gandalf arriving at Helms Deep, sun parting the dark clouds of doom, it appeared in my hand to save the wretched day. Organized, the mahjong 1 card sat afar to the left...with sequential order the whole way through. A less daring Tichu has never been called. 3 tricks later, my opponent went out. Points rained upon us as our confidence boosted and our opponents began to doubt themselves for the first time. 


The next hand...fire in our eyes, we both went out before our opponents, knocking them into a stunned, scared state. Suddenly, every card played was doubted, every move questioned. They had lost their way. We could taste our moment on the horizon.


But our opponents momentarily recovered. They steadied themselves amidst the next two rounds, winning 50 and 40 points each, taking the total to 475 - 465. This would be the final battle. Possible glory for two, possible total embarrassment for our friends that would be endlessly mocked for blowing such a huge lead. 


My hand was dealt. I searched the cards for faces of Kings and Queens and Aces and Dragons. Nothing. Nothing but a lone Jack amidst a sea of small numbers. But upon closer look...a bomb of 3's. consecutive pairs of 66/77/88, three 9's and the Jack. As the beginning tricks of the round were dropped with singles, I passed. Sitting. Waiting for my moment. The perfect hand to bomb. It never came. A fair hand passed that my opponent would take, but it was bombed and lost. Our opponent was down to 4 cards. It was now or never, he played a pair of Q's. I bombed. And then readied myself for the final strike. 66/77/88. No one could match. Three 9's. No one could best them. And then I dropped the lone Jack, ridding all my cards first. The last out gave me their taken tricks and remaining cards. We counted the the final tally. It was victory for us. From the brink of defeat. From -110 points below our starting due to failed tichu's and thwarted hands, we rose and conquered our dear friends. And have laughed at them ever since.  </TEXT>

I would definitely try to stick to vocally interactive games like many party games or CAH. Co-Op games like **Pandemic** would work nicely as well. **Pandemic The Cure** is a little lighter too if you can get it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Games in this list that I can speak to...

**Firefly: The Game** is not good at all. It hits some nostalgic notes if you're a fan of the series, but if you take that out of the equation, the game falls very flat. I wouldn't go with this.

**Splendor** is such a good game. The mechanics are extremely simple (you either take tokens, buy a card or reserve a card), but you'll find a good amount of strategy, interesting decisions and replayability with it. And it's quick to play, and scales well for 2-4. 


**Lords of Vegas** is loads of fun. Has some good strategy to it as well, with lots of fun twists. This game is somewhat dependant on your group...for instance I have a couple guys in my group that always love to take the risky options in games for the hell of it, so that makes this game a blast every time. It's such a fun time.


And if you like co-op, **Robinson Crusoe** is an absolute masterpiece and a must-own for any big co-op fan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That could be true. I also think there's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy with established high ranked games. People pick them up because the see the rating and want to like it too because they think they're supposed to. Obviously they're all tremendous games, but there could be a bit of that too. I know I can give high ranked games more of a chance after a bad play because I know they're supposed to be very good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure! Like anything, if people can easily find you and if you provide a unique insight while being entertaining, people will follow you. I think the most important part (outside of being able to be easily found) is to provide your own unique perspective. I watch a lot of video reviewers like SU SD, Watch It Played, Rahdo and Dice Tower and they all offer their own experience and angles. Be unique. Find your own angle that works for you, reflects who you are and is genuine. If it's good, people will stay. 


edit: and to some of your questions - for me, nothing makes me fall asleep quicker in a blog than extensive rule run summaries. If I wanted in depth rules, I'd read the manual. I'd say if you're doing a full review, maybe stick to a brief overview of the theme, object and basic gameplay mechanics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow...the game itself isn't similar at all to Terra Mystica. In TM you have direct   indirect interaction where you're cutting people off for land and building adjacent with money/power/vp exchanges. TM isn't the most interactive game, but it definitely has interaction, especially with 4-5 people, and 3 as well to a lesser extent. Castles of Mad King Ludwig has none of that. Each player has his own play area where you're building your castle. And unlike Suburbia where you can get bonuses based on what other's have built, in Castles you only get bonuses/penalties for what's in your Castle. The main interaction in Castles comes from the auction block. The "Master Builder" (which rotates like a 1st player marker) gets to take the 5/6/7 room tiles and arrange them in any order he wants on the auction block (ranging from $2k, $4k, $6k etc). So if you see people really need a certain room type, you may want to make it more expensive so they have to pay (and pay you, the master builder), but maybe not too expensive so no one buys it. So there's some interesting decisions to make on how you organize the auction block, trying to predict what people need and what they will or can buy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got a brand new shipment of **Brass**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, and **1775: Rebellion** in from Amazon, but was able to only play CoMKL of that group. I really like this game. We have Suburbia in our group as well, and our group does tend to lean on heavier games, but Suburbia just always felt fiddly to me...easy to mess up with erring on adjusting scores across red lines and missing a tile on someone's board. Castles really streamlines all that and the theme is much more fun. We laughed at each other's castles and made ridiculous kingly declarations as we built. Loved it. 


Also got my all-time favorite game in, **Terra Mystica.** 4 players, I finished a distant second as the Dwarves, with the Fakirs cruising to victory. Fakirs used their Carpet Ride ability to grab the 18 point bonus at the end for biggest land mass, and they had 3 of the 4 cult tracks. Tons of end game scoring for them, very well played. This game is just so good with 4 people. I love it.


Had some lighter fare as well. Busted out a couple games of **Splendor.** I really enjoy this with 2P. I think it highlights the 'reserving a card' as you can use it a bit more defensively if you see someone grabbing coins obviously for a card that fits it. Very simple game with great replay-ability and solid depth.

I played **Machi Koro** for the first time. It was...meh? It didn't really grab me. I got a few cafes and the building stealing card and cruised. I'll play it again if people want but wouldn't recommend it.

And finally, in the Dice Chucker theme, this fits right in...I got a co-op game of my favorite dice chucker game...**Fortune   Glory!** This game is stupid fun. Traveling around, rolling dice, killin nazi's, finding treasure. It's awesome if you don't take it seriously and just have a good time with it. I've always leaned towards heavier euros, and cared more about mechanics than theme, but this game just grabbed me from the start with its Indiana Jones nostalgia, miniatures, funky artwork, I dig it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is basically no theme. I guess you're building a castle manor with some animals and knowledge and ships and buildings? I've played this game hundreds of times (often online at boiteajeux.net) and I freaking love it. It's in my top 10 of all time for sure. It scales wonderfully from 2-4 people. It's simple mechanics, a fair bit of depth   strategy and lots of replayability with the different mats and randomization of when the tiles come out. It is a superb game. As everyone here will say, how the dice are used is really neat. It's a bit of luck sometimes what you roll, but with the workers and some knowledge tiles you can mitigate that and keep your long term strategy. It's fantastic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As you get deeper into board games, especially once you delve into medium to heavy weight euros, you'll see the thematic elements wane and strategy/mechanic elements increase. Some people love that. Some people look for board games to be more of a thematic elements aka "ameritrash" games. You may just prefer those types of games right now; lots of randomness, look, story telling, immersion and theme.

Try games like **Fortune   Glory**, **Betrayal at House on the Hill**, **Zombicide**, **Last Night On Earth**, **Nexus Ups** and many more. Those are all very heavy thematic and games with more of an immersion into the experience and theme.  </TEXT>

Question for you: how do you think something like this will do on indiegogo/kickstarter. The traditional product on this is something that the consumer can get or receive (i.e. a boardgame, toy, music, electronic etc), but as a brick   mortar store, only someone in your area could physically benefit from this. Why, besides out of sheer generosity, would someone outside your area be compelled to support this? Or are you simply expecting the support and funds to come directly from the Beverly area? </TEXT>

It was magical 2 years ago when he hit all those game-tying and go ahead homers. Magical. But let's not kid ourselves. This isn't trading Gretzky in his prime. It's trading a home run specialist, whose main position is the same as your top prospect, in a time where you need to juice up the farm system. It's a win for the Braves.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Keith Law on the Gattis trade </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-15 15:59:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's insider so I copied the text below. [Here's the link](http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/keith-law/post?id=3225 ex_cid=InsiderTwitter_Law_GattisTrade)

In dealing a trio of prospects for Evan Gattis, I really don't understand what the Astros are doing. The prospect depth they have in their system could allow them to acquire a player of a much higher caliber than Gattis, preferably a younger one as well, someone who's going to contribute to the next good Astros team in a few years. Atlanta, meanwhile, has gone from a bottom-five system in baseball to likely a top-10 system, overhauling their major-league roster while adding a broad mix of near- and long-term talent to their farm, in this case trading a player somewhere near the apex of his value for a very strong return. 

Gattis is already 28 years old, coming back to pro ball late after several years of off-field problems, and he brings four years of control. In two not-quite-full major-league seasons, he's shown big power, poor defense, horrible on-base skills, and huge platoon splits -- killing lefties but posting a .241/.297/.469 line against right-handers with enormous problems against right-handed breaking stuff. While Houston's a good ballpark for dead-pull right-handed power hitters, he's virtually positionless and doesn't address the Astros' major needs for hitters who get on base or at least make more contact. He's also disappeared in the second half in both of his years in the majors -- whether due to physical wear and tear or inability to make in-season adjustments -- and his body isn't durable. He's probably a bench guy, or a platoon player, but not a full-time solution at any position. The Astros also pick up James Hoyt, a hard-throwing (93-97 mph) right-hander that Atlanta signed from an independent league for $500 after the 2012 season, a good bet to provide some value in middle relief right away. 

In exchange for Gattis, Atlanta gets three prospects with question marks, but all of whom are legitimate major-league prospects with real asset value today. Mike Foltynewicz is the big get, and I would have traded Gattis for him alone. Folty is a high-beta prospect with the upside of a potential No. 1 starter if he can develop a more consistent arm slot and find an average third pitch to go along with an 80 fastball and 70 curveball. He drops down on the fastball at times and comes back up to get depth on the curveball, a trick that major-league hitters will exploit. His changeup will show plus, and ditching his slider (which he did early in 2014) may help him spend more time working on the change, but the change isn't good enough now to keep lefties from sitting on his four-seamer. Drafted in the first round in 2010, he's never seen the DL, and has the size and frame to be a durable 200-inning starter. His floor is a Nate Eovaldi type, and he'd be a wipeout reliever, but Atlanta has to develop him as a starter and hope the changeup comes along to the point where he can lead their rotation in 2017. 

Third baseman Rio Ruiz has developed nicely as a hitter, showing outstanding patience -- his walk rate put him among the top 10% of minor-league hitters this year, even though he was just 20 in a high-A league. Lancaster is a tremendous place to hit, however, and his power output was a little light given his home environment. He has good natural feel to hit and much of his contact is hard, but his load is getting too deep with his weight too much on his back side, interfering with his timing and reducing his ability to drive the ball out. At third base, he has the hands and arm, but he lacks rhythm in his feet and the ball tends to play him unless he's coming in on it; he has a chance to play at third, although it's at least 50/50 that he moves to first. Unlike a lot of young left-handed hitters, he has no real problem facing lefties. He projects as something similar to what Matt Carpenter has become for the Cardinals -- a high-OBP doubles hitter, a little less glove, a little more pop -- if he can stay at the hot corner. 

Andrew Thurman was a command right-hander when the Astros took him out of UC-Irvine in the second round in 2013, then started hitting 95-96 in spring training last year, only to head to the cold weather of the Midwest League and struggle with his control. He'll pitch with a 55 fastball and shows three potentially average or better secondary pitches, but nothing is plus and he has to throw strikes to succeed. I still like him as a potential fourth or fifth starter, but that assumes that he can harness his newfound velocity and stop walking guys. Of the three guys Atlanta got back in this trade, he has the lowest ceiling and the lowest probability, the latter due to his difficulty against low-A hitters last season. 

There's a good chance Atlanta walks out of this deal with an above-average starting pitcher and an everyday third baseman, which would be a heck of a return for a flawed player like Gattis. The Astros get four years of control of Gattis, and if they choose to use him behind the plate on occasion, the acquisition might free them up to trade one of their many catchers ... but is this the kind of player the Astros should be trying to acquire right now? They're not contenders this year, probably not in 2016, and by 2017 Gattis will be turning 31 and past peak, which we've probably already seen. I have no objection to the Astros trading from their passel of prospects to add real major-league talent, but they should be aiming higher than an OBP sinkhole who doesn't add value on defense. Foltynewicz is well-regarded throughout the industry, and I think he could have headlined a package for a much better player, now or during the 2014 season. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My only tip would be to all play as humans. Keeps everything even throughout the players and lets you get the understanding of the game. and ass /u/Show-Me-Your-Moves said, don't add house rules before you play the game. I've played lots of Eclipse and have never removed missiles and it's not a big deal. Sometimes someone gets missiles early, sometimes they come out real late. Sometimes someone gets a bunch of awesome discovery tiles and you don't. Things balance out during the game and each game unfolds differently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I enjoy the [Settlers of America](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/67239/settlers-america-trails-rails). Cities   Knights is probably the most popular expansion (i think?). 


Overall, in /r/boardgames, you're going to find a lot of Catan hate (and some love). It's such a popular game, a lot of people got their board game start playing it, and playing it to death, before moving on to games with much more strategy and depth. 


How old is your son? Ticket To Ride is a great intro game. Other games like Carcassonne or Dominion are easy enough to pick up, but off a ton of depth in strategy and replayability. Splendor is a new hotness that's simple, fun and strategic. Takenoko is a big hit with my gf who hates board games. It's a light, fun, beautiful game, and has a similar hexagonal tile element.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8 hours?! Yeesh. Even with rule checking etc, sounds like you guys have a lot of analysis paralysis. I own the game, and have never had a game go over 4 hours. My recommendation: agree to a shot clock. Don't sit in the headline phase for 5 minutes agonizing over which event card to play or where to place influence etc. Set a time limit that you'll both agree to stay within to the best of your ability. And that should organically work out anyway as you get more comfortable with the game and what cards will be coming.  </TEXT>

He has reimbursed me for the camera but I'm wondering if there's anyway to fix the water logged one. It's been a couple months since so it's had sufficient time to dry out, but it doesn't turn or anything. Any chance I could take it somewhere to swap out a part or fix it somehow? </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Dead of Winter.** 

It is an overall cooperative game. You need to complete the main objective together. However, everyone also has a secret objective (none, one or some of which may be a betrayal objective) that each person needs to attempt to complete so they can individually win. It adds a lot of tension, suspicion between players (you never know if anyone has a betrayal objective or how many people may). This game is phenomenal.  </TEXT>

It's a lot like Cards Against Humanity but with a sales pitch. One person is the "customer" (aka they'll have a card that says 'babysitter,' 'engineer,' 'beggar' etc) and everyone else will combine 2 of their cards to make a product. So instead of everyone just laying their cards down and 1 person picking their favorite, everyone pitches their product to the customer! If you play it with the right group, it's fun as hell.

<TEXT> I am with merqueen. When it comes down to it, yea Harry is the savior of the wizarding world (but not by any skill, genius or merit), he's just a kid. He's a teenager going through teenager shit. He's not the smartest, or the strongest or the fastest or cleverest. He's awkward, self-conscious, extraordinarily self aware and he's got a world of shit to deal with. Everything from trying to ask a girl to a dance from seeing friends murdered in front of him. But at the core he goes through things that teenagers go through, and through those tribulations he emerges [usually] victorious through his personal bravery, friends or simple dumb luck. If you're of a similar age, going through similar circumstances of self-doubt, awkwardness, often singled out and picked on, you look at Harry and think, "damn, I can do this too." </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a counselor, I woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak. As I walked from the front to the back of the cabin, I noticed one of the top bunks where a camper (let's call him Timmy) should have been. Neither Timmy or his sleeping bag were on the bed. I peek out back, thinking maybe he went to take a pee and didn't tell me. Nope. Timmy's not out back. Maybe he went across the field to the bathrooms to take a dump? Go look out front. Peer across, no light on in bathroom building. But now I see a shadowy, hunched figure in the middle of the field. I approach, mag-lite, in hand. As I approach, the smell worsens and the faint sound of tears begins to become audible. I find little Timmy, alone in the athletic field, crouched in his sleeping bag full of shit. 

He had awoke that night and was too much of a pussy to walk to the bathroom in the cold, so he tried to hop in his warm sleeping bag. He couldn't make it fast enough and his body's need to shit soon overcame his weak mind. He stopped, dropped his pants (inside the sleeping bag) and shit inside his place of sleep. Once the relief of his massive shit passed, he realized what he had done, froze, and remained there in his humiliated tears for over an hour. He also peed. 

edit: gold cuz my camper shit himself in a sleeping bag?! thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Markakis isn't getting close to $15mill a year so he wouldn't be a Lowe/BJ/Uggla situation. I'd guess he'd be looking at $8-10 mill? I wouldn't mind Aoki for the right price though. His LD% increased, and some peripherals like HR/FB and infield hit rate were actually lower than his first couple years. He doesn't strike out much either which is nice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you'd rather stick a minor leaguer that's not ready? Magically create a young stud RF that can develop in RF and hit his prime in 2017? Just bench every good player on lose every game until 2017? Put Jose Constanza in RF? You need someone to play there. There's no reason not to get a serviceable, veteran guy who can help mentor young players and won't (or shouldn't) cost that much. Let's be clear here. The Braves aren't turning into the Astros and tanking. They still want to be good, they just know the priority is rebuilding the farm system. Signing Markakis has absolutely zero impact on that. None. It doesn't hurt the team in any way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's a solid veteran leader to have around young guys and in the clubhouse. He improves the team's disastrous strikeout rate by giving a solid contact guy. Basically, see everything that /u/PM-ME-UR-PROBLEMS- said above.


And for your argument...show me where he's trending downward? You provide zero evidence. One could argue he's due for another increase in numbers. His BABIP last 2 seasons are well below his career norms, his K% has decreased, his contact rate has gotten better. If anything, the peripherals suggest he could improve his numbers. His LD% dipped in 2014 and his IFFB% jumped. So you could say that was an anomaly and will trend back to their respective means as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2014 Player Comparison

Player A: 573 AB / .271 AVG / .351 OBP / 735 OPS / 74 R / 155 H / 26 2B / 11 HR / 58 RBI / 67 BB / 98 SO

Player B: 642 AB / .276 AVG / .342 OBP /729 OPS / 81 R / 177 H / 27 2B / 14 HR / 50 RBI / 62 BB / 84 SO



Player A is Heyward, Player B is Markakis. Markakis makes better contact, strikes out less, and has just about the same line drive and HR rate. Markakis has slightly better numbers in O-Swing% and Z-Swing% and much better contact rates at O   Z-Contact% than Heyward. 

Yes, Heyward's defense more than makes up for any disparity at the plate (fangraps WAR for Heyward last year was 5.1 and Markakis was 2.5). But Markakis won't come with Heyward's price tag (after 2015) and gives us a higher contact bat in the lineup. Would I rather have Heyward? Yes, of course. But Markakis isn't bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On paper. And we had the 2nd worst offense, only to Padres, in all of baseball. Simba, CJ and BJ were strikeout machines. All of the infield, except Freddie, were black holes at the plate. Freddie slumped, didn't hit for power. Heyward got on base at a good clip, but didn't hit all that well. JUpton's numbers were buoyed by a few great streaks. One of which came in that big losing streak so it was wasted, not that that was any fault of his.

Why are people saying Chris Johnson was good at the plate this year???? Did you people watch games???  </TEXT>

Heyward has 1 year left on his deal, and by all accounts the Braves weren't going to be able to match what he may get on the market. Shelby Miller is young and, more importantly, has **4 years of control.** For GM's in baseball, money and contract control is HUGE. There's no way this trade would be done if each player had the same remaining contract length </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the article for those without insider:


Monday's trade between the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves indicates the Cardinals are going all-in for 2015. 

Jason Heyward is just a year from free agency, but that one year will be a very valuable one, even if he just maintains the status quo. Getting away from the parade of dubious hitting coaches he worked with in Atlanta may help him unlock the still-untapped reserve of superstar potential in his bat. 

Heyward consistently rates among the majors' best defensive outfielders in terms of both advanced defensive metrics and traditional evaluations. A decent center fielder in high school, he outgrew the position but maintains the athleticism and strong reads that allowed him to play there as an amateur. He's a smart, disciplined hitter who gets on base at a good clip and doesn't strike out excessively, though he has had a lot of trouble maintaining a consistent swing around some shoulder issues; he often cuts off his load, producing too many ground balls with a shorter swing path. 

Oscar Taveras' death left the Cardinals without a clear right fielder for 2015, and this move locks down the position for just $7.8 million, making the team 4-5 wins better right away. It also gives the team the chance to work with Heyward and see if they can make him the MVP candidate most folks (myself included) expected him to become. 

The Cardinals also get two years' worth of right-handed reliever Jordan Walden, who throws a heavy mid-90s fastball and has developed a plus slider. According to pitch f/x data from baseballsavant.com, hitters swung and missed at one of every five sliders Walden threw in 2014, and put just 1.4 percent of them in play for hits. It's an ugly delivery, and he always has had command issues, but I believe the Cardinals have some kind of special fairy dust they sprinkle on relievers to get a little extra something out of them. And even if I just made that up, he'll give them 50-60 above-average innings of late-game relief work. 

[+] EnlargeShelby Miller
Jamie Squire/Getty Images
Atlanta-bound Shelby Miller posted a 2.92 ERA after the All-Star break in 2014.
For their trouble, the Braves get two premium young arms, one ready to step right into their rotation and one who immediately becomes the best pitching prospect in their farm system. Shelby Miller now has two solid, healthy seasons as a major league starter and won't be eligible for arbitration until after 2015. He seemed to find the perfect formula for his pitch mix in the second half of last season, working in his curveball more and using the four-seamer less; in turn he missed more bats, got more called strikes and cut his walk rate substantially. He's a mid-rotation starter at worst, as long as he stays healthy, and given his delivery and the evolution of his approach, I believe he can end up as a solid No. 2 starter. 

Tyrell Jenkins was the No. 74 prospect for me going into the 2012 season, then shoulder injuries robbed him of much of that season and 2013. But he came back healthy this year and was one of the best prospects in the Arizona Fall League. When I saw him there in October, he was 93-96 with good downhill plane, turning the pitch over quite well even at 95 mph, generating lots of ground balls. His slider was plus at 83-87, with curveball depth, and actually got sharper into his second and third innings. His changeup was fringy, straight at 86-88, effective because his delivery of the pitch is close to his fastball delivery, but lacking any life or action. He's as strong as ever, and his shoulder is the healthiest it has been in more than two years. A former three-sport star who had a football scholarship to Baylor, he repeats his delivery very well and has the aggressiveness you'd expect (and want) to see from a former quarterback. He immediately becomes the team's top pitching prospect and should be ready to begin 2015 in Double-A. 

The trade makes a ton of sense for both teams, although it's an acknowledgment on Atlanta's part of the weaknesses of the current roster and farm system and may not read very well to some of their fans. The Cardinals are -- and should be -- in win-now mode; they needed to upgrade their production on the corners and have some pitching depth to play with. As good a prospect as Jenkins is, he has thrown just 215 innings in the last three regular seasons combined and has never pitched a full, healthy season in pro ball. They can replace Miller in the rotation with one of Marco Gonzales or Carlos Martinez, assuming Michael Wacha returns healthy to be the fourth starter behind Wainwright, Lynn, and Lackey, and they have other young arms on the way. 

Atlanta was likely to lose Heyward after the season to free agency, and their farm system was left in terrible shape after former GM Frank Wren's tenure, so this deal helps restock their system with four more years of Miller and potentially six of Jenkins in exchange for one year of Heyward and two of Walden. Atlanta needed to make a trade like this to get younger and extract value from Heyward while they could. The Cardinals didn't have the same urgency, but they strengthened a weak spot on the roster and did so without significantly damaging their future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! I played it earlier this year at a demo day and it's a lot of fun. I'm not even a huge fan of Pandemic or co-op games in general. But this game moves quick, it's easy to pick up, there's a very good balance of luck and strategy. I'd definitely recommend it, even more so if you're a Pandemic fan.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scoring is not opaque at all in Terra Mystica. It's just done differently than some other games. Instead of a linear progression of building more valuable/higher scoring buildings, there are **scoring tiles** for each round that give bonuses for that round only. 

For example, Round 1 might give a bonus for every spade used. Round 2 may give a bonus for every trading house built. So it's very beneficial to time your buildings (if possible) to coincide with the round scoring bonus. That and other things like the cult track are linear progressions...the higher you go, the more you score. When you build a town, get a bonus tile with points. Pretty straightforward. 

Side note: Terra Mystica is my favorite game of all time. Freaking get it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Twilight Struggle** we didn't score the scoring cards properly. We just took whoever "won" and what they got, and never scored the other person. So if someone had Domination, we never gave points to the other person for having Presence the first two games. No wonder the USSR blew out the USA early in both games, ha. Figured it out in game 3, and the game went muuuuch more balanced.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great week of gaming!

Mid-Week I hung out with a friend and we played an intense game of **1st   Goal.** I turned the ball over 4 times, got 3 penalties, lost 2 onside kick attempts, and my buddy had no turnovers, no penalties and won an onside kick. I got stomped, but it was so much fun. The game is just fun. You can't take it seriously or else you'll get frustrated! Just a silly game, with some strategy/trying to know what your friend is going to play.

Sunday night we ended with a great game night after football. Game of **Small World**, which I'm not the biggest fan of, and ended up finishing 3rd. It's a good game, but I've just been more into heavier games lately and this just never clicked with me since I learned it a couple years ago. 

2nd up was a 4 player game of **Terra Mystica**. I got the Nomads and tried to expand as fast as possible early. I ended up being kinda mean, cutting off 2 people and won in the end by a good margin. I was lucky too, as the 1st round scoring tile was for dwellings, the 2nd for trading houses so I lined those up nicely. I absolutely love this game. It's my favorite of all time. Especially with 4-5 players so there's much more interaction and territorial conflict. Everything just fits together so so nicely. And it is gorgeous to look at.


We then moved on to a quick game of **Tichu**. Such a great 4 player/pairs of 2 game. Love the dynamic of the dragon/phoenix and scoring cards. 


A couple friends left so to the end the night, my friend and I busted out **The Duke** for my first time ever. WOW. This game is brilliant. I love it. So simple, lots of strategy, some luck/randomness in which tile you randomly draw. I wonder what would happen if you made a variant where you don't randomly select which tile to draw: just leave em all out on the side and you can pick which one you want every time. Thoughts on that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at Z-Man VIP Table Top Day. I have two extremes of feedback. 


First, I absolutely loved Pandemic: The Cure. It was fun, quick and super engaging. All around great time. Will be an insta-buy in the coming weeks of availability.


Secondly, Contagion was possibly the worst game I've ever played. It's not Pandemic. They branded it as such for marketing. It was dull, repetitive, slow and I couldn't wait to be done playing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have 5 different Dominions and Trains. If you don't have Dominion in your collection, it needs to be. It's an essential game for board gamers. If it's definitely one or the other at this moment, go with Trains. There's more player interaction and some additional depth/more paths to victory due to the board. 


Rising Sun is an expandalone. Similar to Dominion: Intrigue, it fits in with the base game as an expansion, or can be played as it's own as it comes with all the components.


tl;dr You can and should have both. If you can't, I'd say Trains. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This will probably get buried, but can everyone stop getting butthurt about Americans remaking Utopia?? The issue is not if the original is good enough as is, the issue is ACCESS. The vast vast vast majority of Americans do not have access or aren't technologically savvy enough to find access to Utopia. My parents sure as shit aren't going to find torrents to download, but they'll watch the show when it's broadcast on HBO.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm at level 15 right now, and the Crucible was fairly frustrating as I would get rocked by lvl 20-25+ players with more abilities than I have. So I was excited when I logged in today and saw the 'CLASH' sector that says 'Level Advantages Disabled.' I entered a match, and it was the same exact thing. People were level 25-28, had over-armor and boost abilities that I didn't and I got rocked again. What's the deal with CLASH? The level difference is really really annoying, makes me not want to get into the game at all </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im sorry, but I dont want to be an emperor. Thats not my business. I dont want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others happiness - not by each others misery. We dont want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.


Greed has poisoned mens souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost....


 The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.


To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. 


Soldiers! dont give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Dont give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You dont hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Dont fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!


In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: the Kingdom of God is within man - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.


Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!


Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all mens happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!

Just grabbing whatever I can afford to buy/combat every turn. But Star Realms really escalates with the ally powers and it's much more advantageous to do your best to stack up a color. And the bases are much more influential than a mechana construct or others in Ascension </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely love the show. The writing   acting is fantastic. Each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat and the plot moves along too, it doesn't get stagnant. But I talk to friends and most haven't even heard of it and those that have, haven't seen it or know much about it. And I didn't hear much of anything regarding it leading up the Emmy's. What gives? </TEXT>

Came home from worl today to find ice formed in a bowl and all along the hose attachment. They refuse to fix anything, saying the city isn't giving enough pressure (no neighbor is reporting this, we checked) and won't raise the heat. Several of the apartments have dogs. They are threatening to file litigation against anyone who doesn't pay rent or tries to break lease and move out. I'm still holding on to my rent money. 


tl;dr - do NOT move into one of their buildings.

<TEXT> My friends and I played our first 3 player game last night and I have some questions with problems we ran into. I started on the West Coast in Vegas and quickly fell behind as it was very expensive to span out, and my buddy found cheap expansion in the midwest and I could never really catch back up, because later I was completely blocked from expanding East as all the cities had 2 houses on them. This leads to my other question...the Step 3 card is at the bottom, and we had 2 houses on every single city in our 3 areas (the other 2 people had built 16 each), but we still had lots of power plant cards to go. So we spent several rounds simply holding auctions/passing on auctions, collecting resources   money. Until we got to the Step 3 card, built a bunch of houses and the game was over. Is this normal?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a 4 year old mini australian shepherd. He's fantastic with people. Loves em all. However, he doesn't do well with dogs. He gets uber-excited when he sees them and immediately tries to sprint right at em and jump on em (I'm 99.9% sure it's playing). This freaks other dogs out and they growl/bark/snap at him, which then scares him and makes him defensive. I know he needs to be socialized more, but I can't because of this and friends with dogs won't bring their dogs over or really want him at their house. 

I was thinking about bringing him to a doggy day care for some immersion therapy but I don't want him to end up being crated the entire time because he can't get along with any dog. What kind of tricks or training things can I do?

TL;DR my dog sucks with other dogs, need training advice </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just got Twilight Struggle and have unbowed and am looking through the rules, and I just want to clarify something on placing influence tiles in a region. 

So if the enemy has influence or control in a country, can I gain control simply by placing more influence tiles? Lets say my enemy has control of Cuba (3) and I over a course of some turns place 6 influence, do I gain control? Can it be better to do that, if possible, over rolling for realignment or coups?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-01-03 20:10:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my friends and I have no played Eclipse twice and loved it. However, it seems to me both games progressed very peacefully then the end of the final round and it blew up into a massive onslaught on each other for  a few high valued hexes. It made the game seem very "last round dominant" if that's a thing. Has anyone felt the same while playing the game or are we just bad it? Is there a way to get to the game to progress so the first 8 rounds don't just feel like a set up for the final 9th round where everything was decided? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friends and I love the German style strategy games and have played a ton of settlers, Puerto Rico, Dominion, 7 Wonders and eclipse (played for the first time a few days ago and loved it). Now it's pretty much my overdue turn to contribute a game and by and large everything I've read for these three games are all positive reviews. I'd like to find a balance of complex, randomness to encourage replayability, and something that doesn't take crazy long like an Eclipse or Through The Ages. Just looking for basic pros and cons, personal experiences with the games, and what not. Thanks! </TEXT>
