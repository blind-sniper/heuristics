<TEXT> The private fake agents would've missed 100%.

TRUST ME: they truly sucked. And were officious jerks.  At least with TSA, you see some glimmers of professionalism.

Don't forget: private security companies like Argenbright and their ilk in NYC and Boston were the ones that let boxcutters and skeevy people onto the 9/11 flights.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're missing my point -- the private security agents could do whatever they wanted.  

At least now they're somewhat accountable.

However I don't think a machete would've been allowed pre-9/11.  I flew from San Diego to DC in the 70's and I remember I took a clock radio with me.  They made me plug it in at the gate to make sure it worked.  I was perhaps a 12 year old boy. 

I live in DC now.  I hate the security theater.  Coming back from a Nationals game last month, there were all these DHS paramilitary police in black in the Metro.  WTF?!!!

But better them than the Argenbright Security Barney Fifes. </TEXT>

The tavern is City Tavern on M Street.  That story might not be true, but Jefferson definitely ran into a tipsy Hamilton somewhere in the vicinity one night, retired to a tavern, and hammered out an agreement that resulted in a national bank.  My understanding is that it's most likely the City Tavern. </TEXT>

Maybe things are different now, but I grew up in the 70's and you would dial 1 for the international line, then country code, then the local number.

Holy crap you're right, and they still seemed to have had trouble listing the clones properly:

 Tatiana Maslany
as Alison/ Cosima/ Helena/ Rachel and Krystal/ Sarah

Why the "and" in there?  For when one clone pretended to be another?

They missed the transgendered clone, too, but maybe he didn't appear in season 3?

<TEXT> My computer's messed up so no pix of it, but I found what appears to be it via Google:

http://images.europeanwatch.com/images/21/21542.jpg

The numerals on mine seem to be slightly smaller and crisper but that might be the perspective of the photo.  On the back there are two symbols under the IX and a teensy 18K at the bottom -- almost unreadable.  It's in really good shape -- no major scuffs on the lens.

I have very little reason to believe it's a fake.  My cousin had way too much money and the executor of the estate had everything of value appraised.  

The Rolex meanwhile is a Submariner with black dial, steel casing, and no date bubble.  I'm 100% certain it's real.  It came with the box, certificate, receipt, and the little anchor keychain.  

Thanks!

Edit: I then remembered to check visit this page and there are more photos and a valuation.  Is that accurate?  

http://www.europeanwatch.com/21542.html#

All of the other photos stack up except that Patek Philippe is not embossed on the inside of the watchband.  The clasp is identical though.

<TEXT> Oh Jesus, your jet lag is going to be epic.

Cabs are I think $65 or so to downtown.  For Dulles, the only service is Washington Flyer.  If you can afford that, absolutely take them.  Super Shuttles are less but take longer and are in a van, but also charge per person, so maybe a Flyer is better for two travelling together.

The point is both will carry your luggage with you.  Easy-peasy.  

Just ditch your luggage in your room and go wandering.  Just get a hotel within walking distance of the Mall.  Your time is too short to learn the Metro.  If you have lots of money, the Willard is the absolute best choice.  Hotel Harrington is near it and more price-conscious.   </TEXT>

Regardless, call the Hotel Harrington.  Stay there if you need a hotel room, but if not, I'm pretty sure they have a baggage room that's amenable to tourists needing to park their bags.  It's right off of the Mall.  Kinda shabby, but perfectly nice.

Anyhow, when we get clobbered, Chicago's used to the recovery, but we dig out after a few days just OK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've spent limited time in Chicago but watched pretty much every ep of ER, The Good Wife, and Shameless.

Be prepared for a Chicago-condition winter but one that will last only a week.  Our summers will be tougher to acclimate to -- 95F plus humidity is life-draining.  Our springs and autumns however are world-class.  I swear during cherry blossom week, DC is this prettiest city on the planet.  

Washington itself is much smaller obviously so I bet faster to get around.  The L from O'Hare to downtown amazed me how long it took.  

DC's got a weird duality in that it's insular amongst social circles yet everybody welcomes a newcomer.  The city is also much more international than Chicago -- a good chunk of your class will be foreign.  

You'll be fine.  Lots of midwesterners here.   </TEXT>

But anytime I'd see an EST type on TV, the females sounded like that, while the males weren't too different from modern self-help types.


For my mini-generation, I think that's remarkable as normally it's the adults thinking the teenagers were going insane.

There was a terrific movie where a real-life EST girl coralled a director.  It's on the tip of my tongue.  

Anyhow, that movement was weird.  I hear Erhard has vanished.

<TEXT> This is exactly correct.  If you have an over the air antenna you can the FCC-controlled broadcasters listed above, but redditor above forgot The WB, which is the home of Supernatural which I will keep watching until the bitter end.

The broadcasters also have a number of sub-channels.  For example, my ABC affiliate has a channel 7.2 that shows reruns of the best 70's and 80's shows.  My CBS affiliate has a 9.3 that shows the weather radar loops.

Meanwhile on cable/sat there's basic cable -- AMC with Breaking Bad -- and premium cable -- HBO with Game of Thrones.

<TEXT> I'm not sure what exactly you're referring to as Ackroyd and Martin were aping a Czech accent and the woman a manufactured accent, but for the people speaking normally and having been grown up in the 70's, I can add

- on the SNL skit, that's Larraine Newman in the middle.  She was hilarious.  The accent you hear her speaking in was the famous Mid-Atlantic American accent from the 40's Hollywood.  See My Girl Friday.  She didn't normally talk this way, but I bet thought it the best choice for an arts patron of the period.

- JZ Knight is more interesting.  The accent before she went into character is only of the 70's.  It's the way people involved in the self-enlightenment programs such as EST spoke.  You could spot them immediately.  I never encountered one in real as I was too young, and I think it was mostly a West Coast thing.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in zone 2 and regularly leave my car in one spot for mulitiple weeks.  I don't drive very often.

OP it depends on your immediate neighborhood.

Street cleaning rarely happens unlike say NYC.  I don't think I've ever been affected by it.  DC lets Mother Nature clean the streets.  

How long it takes to find a spot is up to your immediate traffic patterns.  For me, Friday nights is the worst, but I know not to drive on Sunday mornings due to all of the churches in the vicinity.

The absolute worst is when a neighbor throws a party and hires parking attendants to valet park their guests' cars.  Every block within reasonable walking distance gets shut down.

I like having my own car.  You can easily live without one if need be though -- zipcar is quite the rage these days.  Do a cost/benefit calculation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno about that.

I remember during the Vancouver Winter Olympics, Digg sent a reporter to interview alpine skier Julie Mancuso.  The format was no holds barred as there was no FCC involved, but the interview was announced 48 hours before it began so diggers could submit questions and she had to answer the top ten "digg'd" questions.  It was a wonderful interview -- she had dug in in a chalet, was wearing a cuter Russian fur hat for fun, and happily bit on the more salacious digg'd questions.  She was in her element.

I thought it was one of the single best athlete interviews I've ever seen.  

At the time, I thought that I was seeing for the first time what new media was truly capable of.  

Then Digg imploded.  

No NBC, no BBC, no whatever press operations wanting to get to her, and all they had to do was listen in for content.

IT WAS GREAT.  The single best Mancuso interview I've ever seen.

It wouldn't have been not that hard for reddit to adapt that format to LIVE AMA

Digg was ahead of its times.

Here's pic of Julie in that era:

Dunno how well this link will work, but it appears the construction site is probably where that pic was taken from, but you'll notice trees just west of it:

<TEXT> I might accept that challenge.  But it'd be a little underwhelming -- I too live in DC and all of the ones I recognized are the same.

That pic of the White House threw me a little bit though.  I think the portion that's got the trees on the roof is actually the East Wing, which is now the First Lady's base of operations and the main actual entrance to get into the White House.  They must've have a promenade on the roof back then.

The West Wing wasn't built until the 30's or so.

The Castle, the Capitol, Treasury, what was then the State   War Department and is now the Eisenhower Building -- they all look exactly the same.

I don't recognize the Printing   Engraving Building or the Pension Office.  They may have been razed since these were taken.   </TEXT>

The corset thing sort of hid it, but when you see her move, it does look like she was wearing a diaper.

The ep I saw had something to do with the rescue of a scientist with a secret potion.  Diana loved kicking a Nazi's ass once as Wonder Woman.  She was actually in danger in this ep.

<TEXT> I do!  DirecTV with an over-the-air add-on and a woefully maxed-out DVR.  

Bonus: it's hooked up to a CRT television.

I can't stand watching TV over the internets.  Lower quality, horrible sound, etc.  

Mind you the only thing I watch live are sports or the occasional season finale.  Sometimes reality TV eps in order to bitch   moan live online.  

Edit: Plus live newscasts -- you can't beat live TV when a hurricane or blizzard is in the mix. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Breaking Bad, easily.  I watched the pilot as it first aired.  It had been getting favorable pre-reviews across the board.  I have DirecTV so it wasn't even in HD at the time, which might have made WW's tightie whities a little easier to take.  Had I seen them in HD I might've bailed.

2nd choice would be Buffy.  I fudge on the rules a little though: the first ep I saw is what turned out to be the S1 finale, however, S1 was a half-season.  They re-ran that half season in order over the summer, I watched or VCR'd each ep and then launched into S2 without missing a beat.

I plead forgiveness for fudging as this was the late 90's. </TEXT>

I was standing in the main viewing stand with the official countdown timer just in front of me.  I remember that just after they announced the abort, the heatwave from the main engines hit me and lifted the cuffs of my pants.  

I can only imagine what the full launch would've done. 

Earlier that year, maybe even late '84, I happened to be in a parking lot in Santa Barbara waiting for a bus shuttle to LA when two sonic booms startled me.  

Yup, a shuttle landing at Vandenburg.  I had no idea what the sound was until I got home.  It sounded like a pair of surround sound shotgun blasts, but catching you more in the chest. </TEXT>

I didn't know it existed.  I grew up in the 70's so if there's any detail you need, I was there.  

Did they report on the Schwinn banana seat bicycle?  That was the defining thing to own for my generation as boys.

Typically though I find these retrospectives are done knowing now what happened and filtered accordingly.  

Jerry Ford's handling of the Pueblo Crisis is a footnote now, but I remember it got my attention.  We'd just gotten out of Vietnam and suddenly North Korea wanted to mess with us.  We really didn't need that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't know the Brits relegated the games to third-tier broadcasters.  Promote the matches, get them on the air where everybody can see them, and I bet the audience would grow.  I'd imagine little English girls would be just as interested as little American girls, which is the core audience that seeded interest in the '99 WC.

It seems like this is just benighted broadcasters not realizing what they have on their hands.

<TEXT> States can operate in parallel to the federal government.

I read that a state contested Flying Dog's Raging Bitch.  

It's ultimately apparent that they're talking about canines so the word bitch in the context isn't pejorative.  Whatever state it was withdrew the challenge, but the feds had already let it go through.

My bet is that you need to get pre-approved for federal purposes but the states can challenge it as they see fit. </TEXT>

Anyhow, adding some context to the story, this is in Adams-Morgan (thus the play on the bar's name), which at the time had been having a spree of pop-up electronic music dance parties occurring in unlicensed venues.   

This is what chimed in /r/dc :

 I think ABRA was concerned about the onslaught of those dance clubs that would pop up in unlicensed venues. So in order to stomp them out, they had to ding up Madam's Organ to show that they were enforcing noise violations across the board.

<TEXT> Ah he wasn't a draft dodger by any stretch.  He was 34 when Pearl Harbor was bombed.  That being said, he didn't exert himself to serve.  I have read that the WWII vets resented him for all of his war movies.

From wiki:

America's entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status, classified as 3-A (family deferment). He repeatedly wrote John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit, but consistently kept postponing it until after "he finished just one or two pictures".[4]:212 Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him; Herbert J. Yates, President of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract,[4]:220 and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.[4]:213

Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944.[4]:253 with the USO[27][28][29] By many accounts, Wayne's failure to serve in the military was the most painful experience of his life.[4]:212 His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: "He would become a 'superpatriot' for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home."[30]

U.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne had, in fact, made an application [31] to serve in the OSS, today's equivalent of the CIA, and had been accepted within the U.S. Army's allotted billet to the OSS. William Donovan, OSS Commander, wrote Wayne a letter informing him of his acceptance in to the Field Photographic Unit, but the letter went to his estranged wife Josephine's home. She never told him about it.[32] Donovan also issued an OSS Certificate of Service to Wayne.[33] </TEXT>

<TITLE> [bug] Never ending reddit is conking out too quickly. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-22 06:34:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *What's the problem?*   
I reformatted my computer three weeks ago.  Never ending RES used to get me to 1000 or more and is now conking out at 200. 

Just now I got "There doesn't seem to be anything here! (Why not?)" at 25.



*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
On Firefox: AdBlock, BetterPRivacy, FEBE, Ghostery, HTTPS-Everywhere, NoScript, NoSquint, RES, SecureSanitzer, TinEye, and the only new addition to my line-up YouTube High Definition 36.0.

Except for YouTube HD, this was my exact line-up pre-reformatting.  

Is there anything I can do to get back to seeing never ending reddit displaying deep into the 800's?


*Did you read the known issues and search /r/RESissues?*  
Yes but nothing seemed current.

<TEXT> If this is an RES thing, please advise and I'll submit there.

I'm stuck with a perpetual -1 next to me.  When I try to upvote or downvote myself, it increases the -1 to -2 and -3, but I can get it back to -1. 

I don't know how I did this, but I spent a lot of east coast USA late hours in /r/olympics last week while tipsy.  I think I may have inadvertently tried to upvote a comment I forgot that I had made -- things were moving very fast in say the womens slalom thread.  Maybe I tried upvoting an event thread which were self posts?  

Any idea how to set myself back to neutral?
