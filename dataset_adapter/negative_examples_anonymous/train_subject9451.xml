<TEXT> As an aspiring chef-to-be, I'm working on incorporating world food cultures into my repitoire. I want to know how history and everyday aspects of life shape and develop your cuisine.

I want to know how neighbouring nations, religion, gender roles, family, changing populations, etc., has carved out your distinct culinary lifestyle.

If you can help me out, Reddit, tell me about your food. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every cook develops hands that don't respond to heat as much, and every cut isnt a cut, but a future "chef tattoo."

Also for the aspiring cooks out there, if you're nervous about knives, take this advice. Every minor cut will heal, so stop worrying about princess hands. Same for hot stuff, burns heal too.

At any given time I have at least 2 little cuts and singed fingertips. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I enjoy some good classic Family Guy, especially the Star Wars parodies, but I never felt like Bojack was anything like it.

Yes, it starts dumb, what adult animated doesn't? Then I got further in and the characters roped me in. I got attatched to the romance dynamic Bojack had to Whatsherface, what an emotional rollercoaster.

Never had an animated show (and verrrry few live action) teared me up like that. 10/10 would recommend. </TEXT>

I used to have a good friend who got drunk, had sex with her boyfriend, regretted it, and tried to get police involved.

If you can't hold your liquid or drugs, dont take them. Do not try to ruin other's lives because you fucked up.

P.S., not friends with that girl anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Story time!

I'm in my second year at a culinary and hospitality college, and it's pretty damn diverse.

So I'm in the kitchens with my buddies, and people are ordering their food from the servers. Well most of these servers/hospitality students come from overseas to learn. So whenever there's a bill that has an "ask server" note, they come over to explain.

I'm all for cultural diversity, but if the head of the kitchen doesnt understand a fucking word the servers are saying, you shouldn't be in that job until you learn the local language.

TL;DR; learn how to speak to people before you try to be in a business criticality dependant on communication. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for detailed rant.

For privacy reasons, I will be called Dave( male 21), and my girlfriend will be Jess (female 20).

Jess and I have been dating on and off for 4 years, and currently 3 months into a committed relationship. Jess said she may be moving to get away from her abusive mother.

Jess has depression and thoughts of suicide. Her best option is to relocate 1300 kilometres away to her nearest family.

I am a cook and in my second year of college with 9 months left. We both know I can find work in any city in the world.

Most of my life has involved psychiatrists and I've only had a somewhat normal life for about 2 years. Jess feels this has left me unstable still, and is thinking we should split and leave me behind.

We have all the strong feelings for each other though, and we're looking for advice on the subject.

Personally, I prefer any advice on how we could make the relationship stable and work, but I'm open to all advice.

TL;DR; girlfriend moving away for health, should I follow and make work or end relationship? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you read into the comments of the article, most of them involve bashing liberals who hate on Harper.

Put the party ties away and face it, under Harper's leadership, there's been scandals, questionable changes to the cabinet, massive environmental cuts, continuous funding on a proven ineffective war on drugs.

I'm not saying I support other political candidates for office, but we need new leadership, as well as that dusty box of cobwebs we a senate removed.

On a personal note circling back to environmental cuts, my father finished his third diploma in environmental engineering 2 years ago, and in his final year nearly every government position he could have applied for was terminated. He wanted to repair some damage done to this country, but now he's stuck working 90 hour weeks testing asphalt quality in the middle of nowhere. </TEXT>

Idk about you guys, but I don't have the time or energy to work enough to live in something better than a box, drive to work, eat, and raise a kid at $30000 a year (assuming the cost is split with a partner). As it is, I'll probably only be making $30000 a year for the next 5-10 years after college. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ISS is truly a testament to human ingenuity.

A statistic I read somewhere suggested that the US military budget accounts for appoximately 50% of the combined military budgets internationally. One country spends half the world's military spending.

The above 5% figure proposed is hardly a drop in the bucket. US military could easy thrive as the major superpower with even 30% of the international budget. That would free up 8% of American funding, or 312 billion (using requested budget expenditures figure for 2015 fiscal year). 312 billion would build two more ISS satellites (up to 2010 construction).

I'm not saying that we need more research stations orbitting the planet, but that American priorities may be a little (or in my opinion vastly) skewed in the wrong direction. </TEXT>

Let me summarize; rolling green hills of The Shire, birthday party, Frodo gets the ring, rolling green hills of The Shire, walk around The Shire, rolling green hills of The Shire, Ring Wraiths, rolling green hills of The Shire, Tom Bombadil, a freaky forest... rolling green hills of The Bloody, God Damn Shire.

It continues like this for nearly the entire book. For anyone that has seen the movie before the book, you will get a third of the way through it and start getting annoyed that they arent out of The Shire yet, but wait, there's more of it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love hanging out with my friends and playing some games, watch a movie, get some takeout, whatever. Sometimes we split a few bowls, chat, and have a great time. Never once has anyone talked about how much they did/could smoke or harassed the others about doing more. Its entirely about the social experience for us and we love it. And we don't get together for the high, usually its to hang out or have a barbecue, fun stuff.

Edit: we aren't even typical stoners; I'm in college to be a chef, my best bro is a entertainer, and our friends are university students for engineering, music, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have never seen such a misinformed post in my reddit experience.

Yes climate change is a big deal, but its definitely not very big as to why US is running short on water.

Many of the surface water sources are polluted, aquifers are nearly drained to sustain cities that shouldn't exist, such as Las Vegas and parts of California.

Whenever a governing body deems there is an excess of a water source (there is no such thing when it is one of the few things sustaining life on earth), they sign really shitty contracts to sell to Nestle for next to nothing.

The US is running out of water because of decades of corruption, greed, and mismanagement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You start the game level 1, no gold, no stuff, no skills, no connections. You put in some work to get skills, making some money along the way.

Maybe you need to kill some kobalds to make your gold today. You get experience, you get more skills, and you make more money slaying giants. 

Now you can afford some stuff, have a few skills, moving up in the world. Then while killing black drakes in The Badlands you see some level capped raider flying by, decked out in awesome gear. You want to be that guy, but you need more skills and experience for that job. But you want it, and will work for it.

Now you are that pimped out, level capped guy. But then a new expansion rolls, better gear and new opportunities open up. Make better gold, have nicer stuff, maybe get a promotion in your guild.

Anyone else seeing how WoW basically is a timeline of employment? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Copeland's Clarity and any stage of Sandman's Pouch is BiS for destruction. 90% of their dps comes from those trinkets.

I use Weakauras2 to track when Sandman's procs, then I use my Dark Soul-Copeland's-potion macro immediately. The procs often comes in the first 10 seconds of a fight, so I try to get 3 full embers before 9 seconds left on proc, then unload Chaos bolts.

If there is a second target available that will survive long enough, Havoc that target and hit main target/boss.

If the proc comes early, try to get two Bolts out and wait until next Dark Soul phase (use second Dark Soul after opener with 3-4 Bolts ready).

Always Havoc when proc/Dark Soul is up if possible.

Also use Glyph of Havoc. Large dps gain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While stating young people shouldn't drive is beyond stupidly obvious, older age groups should be retested for licencing.

To avoid age discrimination, I think the best way would be for medical professionals be legally bound to forward recommendations to governing bodies that control drivers licencing if there is evidence to suggest comprised ability.

Example, John the 76 year old retired machinist sees his optometrist, who records eyesight that falls into a predetermined range of questionable public safety, so he goes and gets retested on driving ability.

It's not as simple as "old people make driving dangerous," and I know first hand. My great grandfather is in his early 80s and is in better condition than people half his age. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how this comment has so much support, but I'll plead my case anyways.

Couple years ago I took nutrition, and we had assorted fresh fruit and vegetables brought in, organic and traditional varieties.

All of the organic forms tasted less bitter and looked healthier.

Before any one of you say that organic food is a scam of any sort, go try it. Compare a usual strawberry vs. an organic one. You will immediately notice a difference.

As well, organic food is often comparably priced. Even up here in the Great White North, which is frozen 1/3 of the year, we can get quality organic food for barely more than the usual. Most of the cost of non-organics is shipping. Many common fruits and vegetables come from California. </TEXT>

I had some boards in the trunk, if I was leaning on the centre armrest at all, one of the boards would have broken my arm.

Didn't matter to insurance that my 18 yo car was in mint condition (no scratches, rust, etc) with new tires and small engine upgrades, didn't get near enough payout to get another car. Been stuck using a transit system about as reliable as a crackhead. </TEXT>

But the shit and abuse Ramsey pulls is all for shock value on camera. Those people working in there most likely sign papers waiving rights to sue for the emotional abuse he deals.

Things were different say 20 years ago, ive heard stories of chefs smacking people around with large ladles or throwing insert pans across the kitchen. That doesnt fly anymore. Thats now included in battery charges. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being in the culinary business, its shit like this I hate. Sure its small, its supposed to be. That kind of salad is meant to prepare your palette for the main dish.

I'm going to guess you're used to your drive-thrus and 6 big mac combos, with diet coke because you're watching what you eat.

Food is more than shovelling horrid quantities in a gapping maw. It really is an art. It must taste good, and look good too.

As for the pricing comments I'm seeing, it is pretty common for upscale restaurants to have a flat rate and pick a starter, main, and dessert. It may be $40, that's because 75% of the cost goes to paying people who spend years and tens of thousands of dollars training to do the job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It varies with every brand and type of knife. Cheap knives are made to not be sharpened, because they're essentially disposable. Good brands like Henckels, Victorinox, and Global are standard edged, so just put the blade 12* to the stone.

Some other notes, I prefer water stones because its a little quieter, but you end up with water all over the counter (not a big deal).

As well, there's two common styles of sharpening, European and Asian/Japanese. Basically European starts with the block lengthwise towards you, and sharpened by dragging the heel of the blade towards and to the side of you, to get the whole blade. Japanese is faster, but trickier. Take the knife in a good grip and use a chiselling motion from tip to heel (holy hell don't stab the stone and break the knife!).

I like to start Japanese on a rough stone to start with a new edge, then work up over three grades of stones with European. Every few strokes run your thumb perpendicular the blade to check for a lip. If there's one you oversharpened one side. And use the steel rod to finish. And keep using it when using knives a lot. I run my French knife over steel every 15-20 minutes of continuous use. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Professional cook here, if the knife in question makes a lot of noise during sharpening, the person sharpening is doing it wrong.

On rough grits it should sound quieter than walking on gravel, smooth grits shouldn't make any noticeable sound.

If you mean running the edge over the steel rods, that is the most satisfying sound we love to hear in the kitchen. That doesn't sharpen the knife, it straightens the blade, and should sound gloriously smooth if sharpening was done right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My senior year thesis-style essay was written about this and how remotely separate the two subjects are. IIRC the overlap of gamers and reported violence (either school or criminal records) is about 0.03% according to the average of my sources. Its pretty minimal.

In my section where I played devil's advocate, I allowed for some grey area where children play a game and then reenact it. This doesn't happen with just violent video games though. Ever since the begining of time children have copied what they see in the world. My great grandfather was a farmer, so my grandfather played with toy tractors. My grandpa was military and big into war history and movies, so my dad played soldier and had toy tanks.

Those extremist parents blaming games for violence, I think, are unable to distinguish reenacting and acting out violently as separate subjects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a couple factors why I haven't carried cash in years. First of all, its inconvenient. Why should I waste my time, a cashier's time, and the time of others in line finding enough coin and bills to pay, when I can stick or tap a card at a device, and be out in under 15 seconds? Other factors are, my wallet doesn't have a change pocket, and neither do I feel like keeping change loose in my pockets. Also, cash is a liability. Most muggings do not end up in violence if you show your wallet has nothing but secure cards, at least where I'm from. </TEXT>

Its the warrior/druid cc monkeys that need to calm down.

I main a warlock as well, and while I agree cc is out of control, fears are literally my survivability. Not only am I losing most of this or its getting nerfed into the ground, I lose my only defensive cd as well. Warlocks are being gutted and it's why I probably won't pvp after 6.0 anymore, until Blizzard realizes they literally killed a class's viability.

Edit: grammer, spelling, priest content.

Yes we're usually nice. No we don't apologize for everything.

Tim Hortons makes the worst cup of coffee in the country.

Maple syrup is amazing. This is a fact.

We don't say "aboot" we just talk faster than Americans.

Our military is small because no one doesn't like us.

<TEXT> Running the same instances over and over to level cap is the reason I don't level tanks or healers anymore. I recently leveled a Forsaken rogue 1-90 in 74 playing hours exclusively with quests, give or take an hour or two farming what few low level (or any level) Alliance still play on Area 52. I try to visit areas I haven't been through in a long time, which dramatically improves the leveling experience.

As for endgame, Cataclysm, while having a few cool raid mechanics in some fights, was largely unchallenging; Pandaria is faceroll. Nearly cleared Mogushan Vaults in first week of raiding in 2012, which prompted me to take a year and half hiatus from the game, before returning for PvP this spring. Flexible raiding does improve the raid scene, while LFR is pure cancer (I haven't had a group that could clear any raid in months). Unfortunately, Blizzard doesn't know what the game needs anymore, and is leaving LFR while removing Flex.

If anyone decides to want to try WoW again, I would highly recommend avoiding any raids and switching to ranked PvP. Yes, most people are idiots and will throw games. Join a good guild, get some gear, and do some arenas and rated battlegrounds. At first it will likely be easy as you climb the rsting ladders, but around 2000 or higher rating, you'll get stuck. And that's where the challenged and the fun begins.

TL:DR; stop raiding, start beating up players, the PvE community is for filthy casuals. </TEXT>

-Go to order coffee and grilled cheddar panini.
-Foreign employee at the register taking orders.

-Neither the worker or workers co-workers understand a word of English I say when I try to order.

-I have to point at the menu just to get an order.

-Get burnt coffee and bread, without cheddar or even butter on it, with one side of each piece burnt to charcoal.

-Mention it to manager. Manager doesn't speak a word of English.

How can you appreciate food without this philosophy? When I was trained to cut up whole chickens, I gained a lot of useful knowledge, and respect for butchers that know how to make the cuts look so perfect at the supermarket.
If knowing Jell-O comes from an animal bothers you, but you eat fast food at all, you're looking in the wrong direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I can tell playing around with Diana and seeing what much more skilled players say and do, the reasoning on rushing zhonyas is simply survival. Diana is a devastating nuke with crazy stick to enemies, but is also very squishy early and mid game, even with the shield. The general play for her is gankcrazy burstzhonyascooldowns resetround two (more of a late game thing). She has the power for hyper-agressive drives with small risk of it backfiring with a zhonyas.
Now with that said, there is absolutely nothing wrong breaking the build meta. Sometimes I goof around with full attackspeed builds, but there's not a lot of reason to change when its arguably the best (safest) build path for burst AP champions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why does it seem like nearly every book these days is a "New York Times Bestseller." </TITLE>

<TEXT> Walk into any book store, see a book at a friend's place, recently saw the post of a black guy (humorously) reading How to be Black, which had "bestseller" on the cover.

What criteria does The New York Times put out for the right to publish the book endorsed by the paper?

Do publishers/readers think labeling ever book defeats the purpose? Might thr standards be too low?

I've read some pretty bad books, some with that bestseller label on it at least three times. </TEXT>

If my phone, laptop, and desktop go down, I still have a nice rack of music to pick from; two, my uncle has about 1100 CDs and vinyls on the wall, and it's always a conversation piece; three, what roadtrip is complete without friends, junkfood, and a stack of your best bro's favourite albums?

<TEXT> I started with 3rd edition and 3.5 playing Neverwinter Nights, which somewhat prepared me for 4th edition (4th had a lot of changes!). My best advise, go to the local game shop, there's almost always groups of every kind of card/pen+paper player there, and watch, ask questions, borrow a book or download a pdf. You start theoryceafting nasty character builds. Example, I broke my leader druid by giving him a 2d6 weapon that thanks to a druid mechanic, rolls 2d12. Just to swing a heavy stick!
Edit: you WILL make new friends doing this too. Plus it's more fun to go out to a common place, or host d d and beer nights. </TEXT>
