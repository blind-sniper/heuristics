<TEXT> Great analysis Dan, I agree of course on putting your backers first, but you can actually accept pre-orders in a good by charging the customer instantly through [Grandst](https://grandst.com/).
When we ran our [1Sheeld Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma), we accepted pre-orders afterwards, shipped to our Kickstarter backers first, then pre-orders, then got it on Amazon and in retail.
It's an interesting approach though as we are launching another product soon and it makes sense to fulfill your Kickstarter orders first then worry about other orders, I'll consider it in plan :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My recommendation is to put a switch to change the mode of your shield between 3.3V (for the Due) and 5V (for the Mega).

Have you heard of the [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com)? It has that switch and the manufacturers share the schematic design to be open source, check it on [Github](https://github.com/Integreight/1Sheeld-Schematics-and-Board).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recommend the [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com) Arduino shield. It turns your smartphone's hardware into 40 different shields through an Android app.

So you have the sensors like a Gyroscope, Accelerometer, GPS, Proximity, Temperature (I don't know if you have that in the S4).
Also voice recognition, storing data, text to speech, posting on twitter, facebook, video streaming through Skype ... etc.

Check the list of [shields](http://1sheeld.com/shields/) and the getting started tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LlfBoycKE8).

I built with it some projects like a [candy grabber machine](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-create-your-own-candy-grabber-machine-using/), where I used the phone as a Gamepad controller for children to grab candy and teach them about Arduino and coding, it was a nice game in the maker faire. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This one is the easiest, you use 1Sheeld that connects to an old phone, the Arduino is connected to the master fuse so you can send it a message to stop remotely.
With the GPS and accelerometer in the phone, it sends you a text message with the location of the car.

<TITLE> Arduino heavy users, do you think enabling 1Sheelds to connect remotely to each other is worth the effort? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-26 21:48:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you aren't familiar with [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com), it is a physical Arduino shield that connects to smart-phones using bluetooth and make use of their sensors and capabilities inside your Arduino sketch.

It is used mainly for rapid prototyping of your ideas. Instead of buying multiple shields and components to connect them to your Arduino, you can make use of your smart-phone's accelerometer, gyroscope, gravity, gps, speech recognition, screen ...etc with out buying them individually. Currently we have more than 30 of those. You can visit our [website](http://1sheeld.com) or our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma) campaign to know more.

We are planning to launch a new feature to our platform. We will enable 1Sheeld users to connect to other 1Sheelds from their Arduino sketch using our Android app.


This feature will enable you to:

* Read a digital pin from your remote Arduino(s).
* Write to a digital pin to your remote Arduino(s).
* Write to an analog pin (PWM) to your remote Arduino(s).
* Send string or float messages to your remote Arduino(s).
* Get notified whenever an input digital pin in your remote Arduino(s) changes its state.

You have to have 1Sheeld board, an Arduino board and a Bluetooth-enabled Android smart-phone in EACH network node to make use of this feature.

Here is an example code for what the sketch will look like: http://pastebin.com/6AJdXZfY

So what are your thoughts? do you think it worth the effort? We think it will help people prototype connected-hardware projects and ideas easily.
And if you think it is beneficial? what other features can we add? </TEXT>
