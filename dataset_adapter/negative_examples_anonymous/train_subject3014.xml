<TEXT> I'm pretty sure it's about Harry Houdini's son. 

The one scene I remember is where the kid picks the lock of a mailbox and crawls inside to hide from a guy chasing him with a knife. The knife guy finds the kid in the mailbox but can't get him to come out so he drops the knife in the mail slot.

Thanks for any help! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This question may be a little odd, but I'm looking for as many different colored shirts as possible. Long sleeve and short sleeve but no button ups. I don't want logos, patterns or pictures, just solid colors. [This] (http://cdnd.lystit.com/photos/2013/05/07/old-navy-dark-green-heather-classic-vneck-tees-product-1-8542319-185125367_large_flex.jpeg) is the type of shirt I'm describing. 

Ideally I'd like the widest selection of hues there can be so I can use them for a special project I'm working on in one of my classes.

<TITLE> [Help] Should I buy a heavily used Galaxy S3 or a new Galaxy Grand Prime? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-01 00:13:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm in need of a phone and this will be the first that I ever own. Due to my relatively small budget I don't have many options. I've narrowed my choices down to a used Galaxy S3 from Craigslist, or a brand new Galaxy Grand Prime from Amazon. After reviewing all the specifications for both phones I've found that the Grand Prime has an edge with almost every feature; screen size, battery life, camera resolution, weight...

The S3 does have a few things going for it though. Twice as much ram (2GB vs 1GB) and twice as much internal memory (16GB vs 8 GB). Although the internal memory shouldn't be a problem because I plan to use an SD card to expand it. The S3 also has a few extra sensors that the Grand Prime doesn't, such as a gyroscope.

One major factor that I'm considering is the fact that the S3's screen has many cracks in it, and I really would love the q-hd screen the Grand Prime has.

Thanks for any information!

TL;DR: I think the title sums it up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [SERIOUS] Go see The Monkees live or take my brown belt test in karate? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-15 18:32:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I've been taking a karate class for seven years and just next week I'm getting the chance to be tested for brown belt.

I will be testing with at least one other person, possibly my sister. I've been thinking about quitting for a while because my sensi (teacher) doesn't seem to be taking this class as seriously as he used to. One reason I don't want to take the test is that I WILL get hurt somehow, it might be because of getting punched, being slashed with a knife, or I could be hit by pole, but every single person who has taken the test has been injured in one way or another.

On the same day as the test, The Monkees are starting off their reunion tour, and It would be an amazing experience. The venue where they are playing is only forty-five minutes away from where I live, but where they are going to be playing after that is about seven hours away, in New Jersey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess it depends on where you live. Pretty much all of the schools near me have drug/bullying problems, nothing major but enough to garner attention. The short time I did go to a "real" school wasn't bad at all though. In fact I rather enjoyed the whole experience! All my friends who were home-schooled and went to school are very happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was younger my parents had a lot of input about what I was doing for school work. These past couple of years I've been overseeing myself mostly. No tutors per say, but my mom knows a lot of teachers and she sometimes gets them to do something like, a weekly math class for a month or so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worth it? Just from interacting with teens your own age everyday? It's cool that you stayed home-schooled for so long, a couple of my friends decided to go to school a little younger than that. Most of them went to school at around 11 or 12 years old </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me, in an orange t-shirt and brown shorts playing tag with my cousins. I remember this because it was *the moment* I realized I existed. I know it sounds weird, but at that moment I stopped playing for a second and thought: "I'm here"

I then went on to win that game of tag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that no one knows if there's an afterlife of any kind. Thinking about this used to REALLY freak me out when I was younger, I mean full on panic attacks. It still makes me sick to my stomach when I think about it now.

<TEXT> Finally! Me and my cousin have been making weird and wonderful flavor combos for ages. We've tried at least 2 dozen different things. Some of our favorites include  


  Potato chips + Cake frosting  
Jell-O + Mashed potatoes   
Asparagus + Raspberry jelly  
Bananas + Maple syrup  
Tomatoes + Baked Beans  

And cinnamon, lots and lots of cinnamon. We put that on almost everything: Pizza, salad, eggs, soup, sandwiches, hamburgers and even on fruit!

<TITLE> [TOMT] [Song] Modern(ish) Jazzy song? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-01 00:34:43 </DATE>

<TEXT> I've only heard the song I'm looking for twice. Both times it was played on a radio station that plays bands like: AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and other bands, mostly from the 70's and 80's. I think it has piano, drums, bass, vocals and flute for most of it. Just one man is singing. I can't remember any of the lyrics to it. Please let me know if there is anything else that would help!


Edit: It's not a rock song at all. It sounds like it should be on an easy listening station or something like that

Edit 2: I took a look at some more Jethro Tull songs and the one I'm looking for sounds a lot like Jethro Tull's [Serenade To A Cuckoo cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh4GZJlQCfY) except with a singer and more upbeat. </TEXT>
