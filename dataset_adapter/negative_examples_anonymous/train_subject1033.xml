<TEXT> can Salon just be banned?

Why does the American Right always insist on censoring or banning anything with which they disagree?

Reddit is, by deliberate design, meant to be a haven for ***USER***-submitted, ***USER***-curated content.

Reddit was never meant to be "a place where reactionary right-wingers won't have to risk getting their poor widdle fee-fees hurt." Previous management of this very subreddit found out that censorship, user bans, and false appellations such as "Not US Politics," "Off Topic," and "Rehosted Content" only backfire. Most of those Mods are gone now. 

If you long for the comfort of a "Free Republic"-style echo chamber on reddit, try /r/conservative for one, where any mention of the Republicans' multi-decade ["Southern Strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) will get you flat-out banned.

<TEXT> As always, it is important to note that *The New American* is the house publication of the John Birch Society.

The John Birch Society believed that both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy were "active, willing agents of the International Communist Conspiracy."

They also believed that fluoridated water was a Communist plot designed to stupefy the American population and prepare us for the inevitable Communist invasion to destroy America and all she stands for.

It's not at all difficult to see the parallels between the John Birch Society and other more recent movements on today's reactionary right.

See the "Jade Helm" paranoia, for one, in which Chinese soldiers are supposed to emerge from newly-dug tunnels beneath shuttered Wal-Marts to take over the United States.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I mean, more specifically, is the subdivision within the Republican coalition which Establishment Republicans lead.

At best, the Wall Street/Country Club Wing of the Republicans humors (a better word might be "tolerates") the single-issue 'morals' voters -- but *only* because they bring the votes. Once any of those "moral planks" starts costing them votes, they dump it.

The Wall Street/Country Club Wing of the Republicans couldn't care less about the social issues, but they are happy to exploit rage over them to win the votes of a population that, were it not for these id-tapping rage issues, would have no objective reason for to voting Republican.

For example: the Republicans have lost on marriage equality. They can't continue to rant about "the homosexual agenda" and be taken seriously. They know this.

That leaves only a few single-issue wedges they can still reliably exploit for votes, one of which is abortion.

On abortion: the Republican Party has no intentions whatsoever of banning abortion, despite all of their rhetoric over the decades. Anyone who votes for Republicans on that issue should abandon all hope. The Republicans had the Presidency, a solid majority on the Supreme Court, and full control of Congress for the majority of the Bush/Cheney Era (2001-2009.) Yet they did nothing on abortion. (They did, however, try to kill off Social Security in their 2nd term.)

To sum up, the Republicans will continue to play single-issue anti-abortion voters until their tactics alienate more voters than they attract, just as they did with by exploiting the fear and rage of their anti-LGBT wing for the past 15-20 years.

The Plantation Owners (and their latter-day apologists) invented all of these "Southern Pride! Honor! Heritage! War of Northern Aggression!" distractions to keep the Southerners of the time and their modern descendants from realizing the truth: ***the Plantation Owners viewed the lives of the poor white sharecroppers as worth EVEN LESS than their African slaves.***

Let's restate that to make sure it's even more clear: ***the Plantation Owners viewed the lives of their of African slaves as inherently MORE VALUABLE than of the landless white peasants they sent to die.*** 

*The Confederate Battle Flag is nothing more a sign of their own exploitation  that of poor, landless, Southern whites beneath the very same Plantation Owners and Slavers that the slaves were forced to suffer under.*

So why do so many of the descendants of these poor, landless, sharecropping whites sent to die in the Confederate-initiated Civil War *still* celebrate the symbols of the Confederacy as if it were something of which to be proud? Why continue honor those "Rebel Heroes" who sent their very own families to die for profit?

Yet they'll still run around claiming "Pride! Honor! Heritage!," even thought it was those same bogus "Pride! Honor! Heritage!" lies that sent their own ancestors to the grave in defense of the slaves (and most importantly,  the profits the slaves generated for Southern Aristocrats.) There's nothing remotely "honorable" about that.

<TEXT> Oh really? The Confederates "returned" Fort Sumter to the United States?

Or did they invade it, occupy it, and then use the very cannons and munitions they also stole from the United States to fire upon United States ships?

<TEXT> Most of the South freaked out and abandoned the United States months before Lincoln was even sworn in as President.

It wasn't Lincoln's fault that Plantation Owners were raging paranoids. 

Nor was it the fault of all the poor white Southern sharecroppers sent by the Plantation Owners  to die to protect the slaves in the fields. Do you know what that means? It means that all of the Confederate Ownership Class placed a greater value on the lives of their black African slaves than of lives native white Southerners.

It's always confused me why so many poor Southern whites still proudly wave the Confederate flag  the very symbol of the Plantation Owners that sent all their great-great-grandpappys to die  in order to protect the slaves and the profits they brought to said Owners.

The rich whites of the South kept all the money; the poor whites did all the fighting and dying for their White Masters.  It's not as if they had a choice. "Go fight in my Cotton War or get shot for desertion."

That's why the rich, Plantation-owning whites had to invent all this "Southern Liberty! Heritage! Honor!" horseshit: to distract the poor whites from realizing they were being used as fucking cannon fodder. Some, as we've seen, even fall for that old load of crap *today,* 150 years after the fact.

Yep, those Confederates and Plantation Owners sure were heroes! Why do so many poor Southern whites continue to celebrate the "Heritage" of the Southern Elites who sent their own families to die? </TEXT>

<TEXT> An uncomfortable truth for Confederate apologists, and their modern-day descendants and defenders:

***The Plantation Owners cared far less about the lives of the poor white sharecroppers than they did their African slaves.*** That's why they sent the poor whites to die on the battlefield. That's got to be a bitter pill to swallow, and the entire "Southern Identity" movement is centered on a collective refusal to acknowledge that simple truth.

"PRIDE!" and "HONOR!" and "HERITAGE!" had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Initiating and waging a war against the United States was an economic decision to make the South's fat and happy Plantation Owners fatter and happier, and they used the bodies and blood and limbs of the South's poor whites to do it.

The Confederate Leadership/Plantation Owners sent hundreds of thousands of poor white sharecroppers into a meat grinder because their sole goal was to keep their cotton profits rolling in, and that required safe, healthy slaves to harvest it. And poor, landless whites had no choice but to go war to defend the slaves who generated the cotton profits which kept the Plantation Owners and Confederate funders going.

So why do so many of the descendants of these poor white victims continue to lionize the engineers of their own families' death and destruction? In a way, weren't these poor white sharecroppers used by the rich white Plantation Owners/Profiteers used as pawns and slaves themselves?

There is one difference: the newly-Americanized slaves never worshipped their Confederate oppressors as heroes and role models. Poor whites who still defend the "Lost Cause" and believe the lie of "the War of Northern Aggression" have spent 150 years venerating the very Plantation Owners who sent their great-great-grandpappies to die to preserve and expand their personal profit.

These aren't ideas that Confederate apologists like to entertain, as if they think about it too hard they are forced to realize that they, like the slaves, were ***utterly used,*** and, very ***unlike*** the descendants of slaves, still continue to the lick the boots of those who sent their ancestors to die (even now, 150 years later.)

If so many poor American whites weren't fixated on maintaining this toxic "At least I'm bettr'n *you*" attitude toward poor Americans of other races, all could realize that, if united, have far more interests in common than they would ever expect.

American conservative leadership can *never* allow this realization to take place, or their uneasy coalition of the past 40+ years collapses from beneath them.

And the power of the "Southern Strategy" (employed so successfully by the American Right ever since Richard Nixon) is fading.

Why are the Pauls so afraid to publicly acknowledge their base? (See Rand's surreptitious meeting with Cliven Bundy about "Nevada state sovereignty.")

Calling attention to relevant facts is not a logical fallacy, no matter how much one would like to pretend it is.

Arguing it is of little use if one is a "true believer" in the Pauls and their phony "R*EVOL*UTION." Those who still support the Pauls after the extremist right-wing, paranoid conspiracy crap the Paul Family has squeezed out for decades tells us a lot about their alignments, their sanity, and likely both.

<TEXT> It's surprising that that shitty right-wing fantasy novel hasn't received more attention, given all of the havoc that it's inspired.

That book is where a lot of their "the gub'mint is a-gonna come git mah gunzzz!!1!" and "the coming race war" and "let's nuke the Jews!!1!" fantasies came from.

"The Order" in Denver used it to justify bank robberies and murdering liberal talk show hosts. Timothy McVeigh used it as a model while planning his domestic terrorist attack on Oklahoma City. The Bundy Militia are also big fans.

In case anyone doesn't know what were talking about, *The Turner Diaries* is a novel by a White Supremacist (under a pseudonym, of course) that right-wing domestic terrorists have viewed as an instruction manual for nearly 4 decades now.

Here's the wikipedia entry on it, which is a good start but doesn't nearly capture the poor writing and bizarre conspiracy theories which have come to define the modern American Right:

<TEXT>  this very small minority of southern crazies is literally making the entire south look bad

The same could be said of all the poor, white, landless soldiers that the Plantation Owners deliberately sent to die in order to protect their cotton wealth.

Instead, the descendants of those sent to die by Cotton Profiteers still fall for this "Pride and Heritage" bullshit invented by the Plantation Class to justify sending their great-great grandfathers to die to preserve the "Lost Cause."

Here's something for members of White Wing of today's right-wing to think about: *the lives of poor whites meant even less to the Plantation Owners than did the lives of their African slaves.*

And yet, these poor, angry White Supremacists *still,* even after 150 years, wave the banner of their own forefathers' death and oppression at the hands of the Southern Slavers as if it something of which to be proud.

A couple of years back, some remnants of the Ron Paul/Cliven Bundy/"LIBERTY!!1!"^TM crowd engineered a takeover at certain news and politics subreddits, then started flat-out banning users, content, and publications that they disagreed with.

Hopefully such Mod Frauds will be swiftly dealt with in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many who have a special interest in seeing that stories like these aren't widely distributed.

This is why *Salon*, *Talking Points Memo*, and even *Mother Jones* (for a time) were for so long effectively banned under the fallacious and Mod-imposed "Rehosted Content" rule. 

The de facto ban on *Salon* and *Talking Points Memo* was recently lifted, demonstrating that some Mods are receptive to reason. However, *Media Matters* (and others) still suffer under this artificial, Mod-imposed ban.

I believe that Reddit's /r/politics community should reflect *the community*, not the whims of Mods who seek to censor content which they may personally find distasteful. Reddit is meant to be a Free Marketplace of Ideas, based on user-submitted, user-curated content.

They've attempted to repeat their efforts at Reddit with some notable successes, particularly in "news" and "politics." Similar behind-the-scenes  "Digg Patriot" hijinks were revealed among right-wing extremist Mods, and (presumably as a result) the worst of them are no longer Mods there. 

Many of their hand-picked successors remain, however. These Mods remain quite fond of censoring legitimate user submissions under the flimsiest of pretexts if such stories do not align with their dogma, or reveal causes/personalities they support for what they are.

<TEXT> Here's my recent take:

It's a play to the the Republican's key demographic: poor, angry, rubes who fantasize daily "if this country wuz only run right, ***I'd*** be a Big Shot."

The worship of and reverence for incalculable personal wealth (to which many on the American Right cling) blinds them to their own low status and decreasing possibilities. (Witness the kind of voters that fall for people like Trump, Perot, the Kochs, etc.)

Almost inevitably, their support boils down to the old "well, he's rich, so he must be doin' sumptin' right" canard. </TEXT>

They largely have (see the Paul Libertarians-Chuck Baldwin Constitution Party, ) but they always come home to vote against the Democrats, because "damn lib'ruls."

How fitting that he still finds ways to come ever closer to the pride in unvarnished avarice, malicious ignorance, and unrepentant braggadocio of that bygone era.

Right-Wing Nut-Jobs/Militias are making a lot of noise lately. Worse still, they've become VERY agitated at all developments in the news this past week  the shunning of the Confederate flag, the Obamacare ruling, the marriage rights ruling...

When these people get pissed, they go big.

<TEXT> ... an explanation which the user community will never be able to *see*, as it's been removed. I don't get how the tautology isn't obvious here.

Leave the Mod-affixed label on if you must, but don't hide the content from everyone else.

Otherwise, it's just a matter of hiding behind a label with the direct intent of killing content, and further demonstration that some Mods enforce rules (which in some cases *they themselves* created) arbitrarily, with zero input from the user community.

Mods ***MUST*** be willing to defend and justify their decisions, not seek to deliberately hide them from the community's view. So, if you *must* label something, let the story stand so we as users can have a clearer vision of what the rules are and how they are applied.

You'd like us to obey the rules, right? How can we know what they are if you insist upon instantly hiding examples of violations behind a cloak of secrecy, in some cases in less time than it could have possibly taken for a Mod to read the article?

If Mod's decisions are justified, the logic of a rule's application should be self-evident, don't you agree? So why hide the content and the label away from public view?

If a Mod can act as judge, jury and executioner, how can we know that the Mod acted fairly and ethically, especially when the article is suddenly buried from the view of our user community? That makes it *seem* like there's something to hide. Those who cannot (or refuse to) justify their actions should not be the position to control user's access to content in the first place.

Is the need for Mod transparency on these decisions not clear? Do we disagree on that most basic of points? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You really have to give the political consultants on Jindal's campaign credit for the timing of this announcement.

The victims of last week's church shooting aren't in the ground yet, the Confederate flag has captured the news cycle this week, and tomorrow is likely to see the release of the Supreme Court's rulings on gay marriage and the ACA. 

And, Jindal announces his run *after* the deadline for tonight's evening news.

Jindal's staff is either timing-impaired or *trying* to bury news of his announcement. What's your guess?  </TEXT>

The poor.

Stop insisting on seeing things on race lines, and instead take a look in economic terms. The *poor* are the most likely to die from gun violence.

Follow this thought through and you'll realize who profits from promoting, exploiting, and continuing such divisions among the impoverished  and why they will give their all to perpetuate these divisions.

Thankfully, that hellish era seems to be coming to an end, though some of the Mods that were hand-picked and installed during that reign of terror and error are still in place.

Forgive us if we are not quick to trust the motives of those who participated in that failed coup of right-wing extremists *against* the actual wishes of the "User Community." </TEXT>

*Nobody wants your damn guns. Have as many damn guns as you like. Hell, ask a liberal to the range.*

The more paranoid that the NRA/arms dealers/arms manufacturers can make their audience, the better for their each of their bottom lines. The greater the fear, the greater their profits.

It's astounding how successful they've been all these past decades with their false "CONFISCATION IS IMMINENT!" meme. That myth makes the NRA and Wayne LaPierre a lot of money.

None of these sites should have been blocked in the first place, and some still remain on the Automoderator's kill list from the days in which the "Rehosted Content" fiat was first issued.

<TEXT>  That pack of losers gave a country with three times the manpower and industrial capacity a run for their money for four years.

At the cost of 740,000 American lives. That's more than have died in ALL of the military conflicts/wars that America has been involved in, before or since.

Don't expect any sympathy for the Confederate's Lost Cause, or some kind of honorary participation trophy for a useless war which was started by the South's Plantation Class using poor white sharecroppers as cannon fodder.

I don't get why the descendants of these Southern sharecroppers still celebrate their Southern oppressors. Maybe it's fun to play make-believe in order to convince themselves that all the death and suffering actually meant something.

The alternative to recognizing reality must be too heavy a cross to bear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And did any of the Confederate states make any recompense to the federal government for all of the federal property they seized illegally, including Fort Sumter?

No, they didn't did they? The CSA just seized all federal properties for themselves via worthless declarations, didn't they?

Many Right-Libertarians and Confederate apologists make another religion out the "NAP," the "Non-Aggression Principle."

So, whose property rights were violated here first, exactly? And who was it, exactly, that initiated force in violation of these well-established property rights? Who violated the NAP?

These are questions that make Neo-Confederates *very* uncomfortable. Usually, eyes bulging, they'll start sweating and reddening before finally stuttering out a spittle-flicked "S-S-ST-ST-STATES' RAAAAGGGHTS!!11!1!" before storming off like petulant children who *still*, even after 150 years, refuse to acknowledge that they LOST the duel THEY initiated.

<TEXT> Rich Southerners didn't care about white lives either. That's why the Plantation Owners and their Confederate government sent all the poor sharecroppers to die to defend their profits.

The Plantation Class was willing to send sharecropping whites to die to protect their black slaves, whose forced labor was the source of the all the Plantation Owners' cotton profits. 

Chew on that one, Sons of Dixie: the African slaves' lives meant more to the Plantation Owners than the poor white sharecropping class they sent to fight their battles for them. 

That's why it's so strange that the descendants of these same poor white sharecroppers sent to die still wave the flag of their own oppression at the hands of the 1% of their day, the Plantation Owners' Class. They even still fall for the "Southern Pride" and "Southern Heritage" lies that the Plantation Owners invented to justify the war for their Lost Cause. </TEXT>

Most of them were poor sharecroppers living on the Plantation Owners' land, and didn't have a choice. They were conscripted to preserve the economic interests of their Masters, who owned these poor whites nearly as completely as they did their African-descended slaves.

The "Southern Pride" meme that has taken root has helped these poor white sharecroppers and their descendants psychologically deal with their exploitation by their own white Masters who used them as cannon fodder to protect their cotton profits.

I believe that middle/lower-caste Libertarians are so goddamned starry-eyed over their greed-driven, bankrupt ideology that they they can't see how they'll be crushed under the wheels of the 0.001% leisure class they live to fellate.

And so we come to the central delusion of Libertarianism: most all Libertarians are so fucking gullible they believe they'll *be* among that 0.001% that calls the shots.

As satisfying as it would be to see all of these "Liberty-Lovers" working on chain gangs at the whim of their newly-installed Masters of Capital, prudence and a love of this nation prevents me from wishing they get a chance to find out how truly, deeply, and disastrously wrong they are.

<TEXT> *A reading from the Newsletters of St. Ron Paul*

Blast 'em?

"If you live in a major city, youve probably already heard about the newest threat to your life and limb, and your family: carjacking.

"It is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos. The youth simply walk up to a car they like, pull a gun, tell the family to get out, steal their jewelry and wallets, and take the car to wreck. Such actions have ballooned in the recent months.

"In the old days, average people could avoid such youth by staying out of bad neighborhoods. Empowered by media, police, and political complicity, however, the youth now roam everywhere looking for cars to steal and people to rob.

"What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposing of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).

"I frankly dont know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, Ive urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. **For the animals are coming.**"

<TEXT> White Nationalists have long fantasized about a "coming Race War."

There's a RWNJ decades-old race-war novel out there ("The Turner Diaries") that many extremists of the American Right view as a blueprint  (Timothy McVeigh among them.)

Ron Paul's racist 1990s newsletters addressed the  "Race War" topic often.

I fear right-wing domestic terrorists and their sympathizers are growing restless again. Given their self-gratifying "Hero Patriot" fantasies in which they "restore America," we should all be aware of the dangers they may pose. We've seen it boil over before, as in Oklahoma City.

"Rockin' In The Free World" by Neil Young

There's colors on the street

Red, white and blue

People shufflin' their feet

People sleepin' in their shoes

But there's a warnin' sign

on the road ahead

There's a lot of people sayin'

we'd be better off dead

Don't feel like Satan,

but I am to them

So I try to forget it,

any way I can.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world.


I see a woman in the night

With a baby in her hand

Under an old street light

Near a garbage can

Now she puts the kid away,

and she's gone to get a hit

She hates her life,

and what she's done to it

There's one more kid
that will never go to school

Never get to fall in love,

never get to be cool.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world.



We got a thousand points of light

For the homeless man

We got a kinder, gentler,

Machine gun hand

We got department stores

and toilet paper

Got styrofoam boxes

for the ozone layer

Got a man of the people,

says keep hope alive

Got fuel to burn,

got roads to drive.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The American Right doesn't give a damn about children, especially once they arrive.

But relentless exploitation of the ***"ZOMG ABORTION!!1!"*** issue sure is a useful tool to manipulate the votes of Christian Nationalists. Anti-abortion hysteria gets many Americans to vote in complete opposition to both their own interests and the best interests of the country.

Does anyone actually believe the Republicans want to lose their favorite wedge issue?

That's why today's Republicans will ***never*** allow abortion to be banned in America. The abortion "debate" brings the American Right Wing too many votes.

<TEXT> Why do people still fall for it?

Sometimes, I almost believe there's a subset of poor Republican voters that just flat-out enjoy the continued degradation and the humiliation.

Even today, the sharecropper still forced to lick the boot of Master still fancies himself higher than a slave. For some people and some voters, maybe that's enough in life.

Nonetheless it seems clear that this pathogenic belief is some foolishly clung-to remnant from the psychology of the European peasantry of centuries ago along with their love/worship of the very hereditary Monarchs that oppressed them so relentlessly. That attitude was transferred to America in the form of the class and caste structure of Antebellum South, and we fought a war that killed 740,000 of us to free ourselves of that remaining horcrux of the Monarchy, the landed gentry of the Plantation Class of the Old South. America all but destroyed itself to liberate itself from that deep-rooted poison.

150 years later, I see little difference in how so many still vote in complete opposition to their interests and that of the nation. It's not "the Gub'mint" that's the threat to our Nation; in fact, "the damn Gub'mint" is the only thing standing between the relentless privateers of capital and commerce who seek to own all for themselves and their families at the expense of all others living in unending servitude to our new Monarchs, the Monarchs of Capital.

So those who who join militias with the intent of "restorin' the Constitution" and "fightin' for our Liberty" should not be at all surprised when they wake one day to find they fought in "the Great Struggle" just to make a Koch their King.*

American stubbornness is not a virtue when it is so relentlessly self-destructive.

*See Libertarian Adam Kokesh's call for "the Final American Revolution" on July 4 a couple years back, or the continued self-delusions of the Sovereign Citizen/Bundy Ranch Milita zealots who fantasize themselves "Patriots." </TEXT>

How did the United States  a nation that survived the Age of the Robber Barons, the Great Wall Street Crash of 1929 with its ensuing Great Depression, and the Financial Meltdown of 2008 and its ensuing Great Recession  not learn the lessons repeated again and again within each circumstance?

<TEXT> Republicans have been playing the "the liberal media are persecuting us!!1!" myth-lie ever since Nixon introduced it in his "Checkers" speech.

[Here's the "Checkers" speech on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqjwBDH-vhY) Give it a listen and hear how Nixon whines and whines and whines about persecution just like the Republicans, Libertarians, and Republitarians today.

Highlights: when Nixon complains that (unlike liberals' wives) his wife Pat Nixon doesn't wear a fur coat, but a "respectable, *Republican* cloth coat" and also invokes the namesake cocker spaniel "Checkers" and how "we're never going to give her back, no matter what *they* say.

It's a masterpiece of self-pitying whining that the Republicans have looked to for inspiration for over 60 years now. Watch it -- it's really worth your time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stopping Reconstruction (at the demand of the South) was even worse.

The War to Preserve Slavery that the poor white sharecroppers were sent to fight killed 750,000 Americans, all for a cause that was already doomed years before the Confederates fired the first shot.

The descendants of these same poor white sharecroppers have misdirected their contempt at Washington DC ever since. It's probably just too painful for many of them to look in their own backyard and realize that they destroyed themselves to keep the Plantation Owner class in power (even a century-and-a-half later after it spat out their dead and broken bodies on that Fool's Errand.)

As always, war is a rich man's quarrels via the suffering and death of the poor, who are sent to fight the battles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  As someone who grew up in one of those "Christian" churches, I can attest that they hate democrats as much as they hate black people, women, and homosexuals.

But why? I'm continually baffled by this.

From whence does that virulent hatred come, and when did it start? Are they still sore over the Civil Rights movement? The New Deal? Richard Nixon's cocker spaniel?

Is their compulsion to inflict their destructive spite against their fellow Americans so great that they are oblivious to the grievous damage they inflict upon themselves? And if so, how can they *possibly* claim to be "followers of Christ?"

Maybe the Evangelical Protestants simply *believe* they're following Christ when they've fallen prey to a scam by "the Great Deceiver." Given the aura of hate, fear, divisiveness and greed that right wing politics has promulgated in America in the last hundred years under the cloak of "morality," it's an idea that merits consideration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Much of the South (and Americans in general) just can't seem to escape their "there are Lords (us), and there are Peasants (everyone else) who just won't learn their proper place" economic worldview.

Such belligerence, arrogance, and greed caused the Plantation Lords of the Old South to launch what remains the bloodiest war in American history, in which over 700,000 Americans were killed.

The sad thing is that so many of the poor, undereducated sharecroppers who are inevitably sent to fight and die for the Master Class will *still* defend those Masters to the death and call their devotion "Patriotism." It's almost as if they have been conditioned to expect and enjoy their own exploitation.

*Maybe* someday they'll snap out of it and actually begin to vote and work in the best interests of themselves and our nation, rather then spending their lives on their knees cringing before the Bossman  but American history teaches us to temper any such expectations.

<TEXT> We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."

Oral surgery has a greater complication rate than surgical abortion. Yet somehow these restrictions weren't placed on oral surgeons (or ANY other outpatient facilities that perform such minor surgeries.) Only women's health clinics were targeted. There's no requirement for double-wide swinging doors to accommodate hospital gurneys in oral surgery facilities, for example, nor will there ever be.

This is direct, blatant, selective, and persecutive legislation by the Texas government against women's medical facilities and obstetricians performing federally legal procedures.

How many cases of cervical/uterine/breast cancer will now go undetected because of these regressive laws? How many women will die from ectopic pregnancies because they didn't have access to basic women's health care? How quickly will cases of sexually transmitted diseases expand and multiply because no testing or treatment was available? How many women will lose their only access to affordable birth control?

This entire "But... but... *it's for the womens' safety!*" charade has never been anything but a damnable lie. But you already knew that.

Nope. Almost instantaneously, the women and their newborns become "welfare queens" and "welfare brats" (who don't even deserve enough in SNAP assistance to keep them alive.)

The fetus fetishists certainly don't give a shit about "honoring a Culture of Life" after launch, do they? Hiding hatred of women behind a cloak of "morality" is the exquisitely cruel SOP of the American Right.  </TEXT>

Imagine those poor Duggar girls lying there awake while they pretended to be asleep, waiting their "turn," powerless to stop their brother Josh from molesting their sisters right in front of the others, wondering what age he'd start on the next one, knowing that they were going to be the next one forced to lift their wrinkled nightshirt so Josh could poke and probe and prod and squeeze wherever he pleased with his sweaty, trembling fingers  

 and all the time knowing that ***it must all be hidden***, first, to protect the family, second because they were allowed no contact with those outside the sect, and third because no one would ever believe them anyway, instead calling them temptresses and liars and sluts and whores who had brought utter disgrace to the family and destroyed the family's means of support with their foul lies . . .  </TEXT>

This is one of the most trusty dog-whistles of the American Right. Translated, it means "what works quite well over there won't work at all over here, because minorities."

<TEXT> The Church has been so hyperfocused/misfocused on pushing right-wing extremism at the expense of the more traditional "Good Works" that they've alienated the last several generations of would-be Catholics. 

Catholics, despite what the American branch of the Church seems to think, just don't want to hear about the evils of abortion and birth control every damn week. If people want to hear that sort of shit, they'd go to some Evangelical Protestant Duggar-esqe "Born-Again" megachurch where all intellect is checked at the door.

This is why children and grandchildren of Catholics just don't go/donate anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About two years ago a gang of extremist right-wing "Censorship Mods" took over. Anything that these Censorship Mods disagreed with (i.e., showed the American Right for what it truly is) was marked "Not US Politics," "Off Topic" or "Rehosted Content." Many news sources (along with any redditors who dared to disagree with the Censorship Mod's fiats) were often banned summarily.

They even banned "Mother Jones" for a while (for the crime of breaking the "Mitt Romney 47%" story,) but the outcry was so great that they were forced to relent.

Within the last month or so, three of the most offensive and blatant "Censorship Mods" were bounced, as they should have been long ago. Their legacy remains, however.

<TEXT> First, stalk and shoot your victim. Beforehand, trail him slowly in your car for several minutes, then get out and follow him on foot. It helps a LOT if your victim is ... well, you know.

Then, plant some Skittles and Arizona Iced Tea on the body. Whack the back of your head on the pavement so you can claim he attacked you, thus violating the Non-Aggression Principle, and thereby allowing you to act in your full, reasonable, rational self-interest by plugging him one right in the heart. Tell everyone he started it, and that you were only acting in self-defense! After all, you're just the friendly Neighborhood Watch guy.

Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, and Murray Rothbard began deliberately cultivating an audience of paranoids and bigots in the mid-1980s. Rothbard even named this strategy "Outreach to the Rednecks." 

One product of this strategy was the infamous *Ron Paul Newsletters,* which have continued to haunt Paul and the Libertarian Party. [Ron Paul was the Libertarians' presidential candidate in 1988.]

That was a massive amount of stimulus spending, but Republicans will never acknowledge it, as it detracts from their masturbation fantasies : "all gub'mint spendin' is evil!" and "Saint Reagan unleashed the economy by cutting taxes!!1!"

They'll never mention that the Reaganites exploded spending.

Also, before some mouth-breathing right winger says, "but ... but ... Congress spends all the money! It warn't Saint Reagan's fault!!1!," here's a fun fact you'll never hear in the right wing media: in *every* budget the Reagan Administration ever submitted to Congress, more spending was requested than Congress ultimately approved.

<TEXT> It's a tragedy how Christian Fundamentalist extremists have managed to sully the phrase "Christian" in barely more than a generation.

"Christian" used to be a noble and honorable appellation, and in its traditional definition remains so.

However, given all of the scandals, scams, hucksterism, fraud, and extremist right-wing political activism we've seen among Evangelical Protestants in the last 30 or so years, "Christian" has picked up very negative connotations such as to imply ignorance, smug self-delusion, and false righteousness.

It should never have been this way, but there was too much money and power to be had.

<TITLE> /r/politics Mods pull Mother Jones article,"LISTEN: Alleged Kansas Gunman Frazier Glenn Miller Discusses the Tea Party, Obama, and Ron Paul" as "Not US Politics" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-14 21:08:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/230x3l/listen_alleged_kansas_gunman_frazier_glenn_miller/

This story was just pulled by the Mods from the /r/politics "New" queue as "Not US Politics." Decide for yourself if their characterization is accurate: the users of /r/politics aren't able to.

Here's the full text of the article:

In a 2010 radio interview, Frazier Glenn Miller, the man suspected of killing three people Sunday at a Jewish community center and a Jewish retirement center in Kansas, said he was interested in the tea party, voiced support for then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and spoke approvingly of Ron Paul, the Texas Republican congressman and presidential candidate. In late April 2010, Miller, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, was a guest on The David Pakman Show, a nationally syndicated left-of-center radio and television program. At the time, Miller was running for US Senate as an independent in his home state of Missouri with the slogan "It's the Jews, Stupid," and Pakman pressed Miller on his extreme views.

During the interview, Miller was unabashed about his anti-Semitic positions. When asked whether he thought the United States would be better off if Hitler had succeeded, Miller responded, "Absolutely, the whole world wouldHitler would have created a paradise on Earth, particularly for white people. But he would have been fair to other people as well." He added, "Germans are blamed collectively because of the alleged so-called Holocaust."

Not surprisingly, Miller denigrated most American politicians, but cited one positively: "If I had my way [all US senators] would be in jail right now for treason, if not hung from a sturdy oak treeRon Paul is the only independent politician, representative in Washington." He also spoke highly of another conservative: "Patrick Buchanan, he's a great man, he's a great historian, he's one of the very few journalists who has the courage to speak out against Jewish domination in the country." Miller called Howard Stern "a Jew liar." When asked whether he supported the tea party, Miller replied, "The school's still out on them. They're a new movement. I'm watching them closely. I suspect, however, they'll be infiltrated by the Jews and therefore led into defeat."

During the interview, Pakman asked Miller whom he would "elect, deport, and waterboard"given the choices of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and former Fed chair Alan Greenspan. Miller answered, "I like Obama more than the other two, by far." He chose to elect Obama, deport Greenspan, and waterboard Biden. Miller said, "I have a great deal of admiration [for] Louis Farrakhan," and he called Ahmadinejad "a great man" because he "has guts and he tells the truth about the Jews."

"I'm a convicted felon and I'm proud of it," Miller boasted, noting that he "was convicted of declaring war on the federal government and possession of illegal weapons." He added that Jews "were responsible for my conviction that prompted me to go underground and declare warMorris Dees mainly, he's a Jew that runs the Southern Poverty Law Center." (The SPLC monitors hate groups.)

In November 2013, Pakman had an exchange of emails with Miller in which Miller noted that he was "close friends" with Craig Cobb, a white supremacist who had attempted to form an all-white town in Leith, North Dakota. According to Miller, the two had worked together "on several White Nationalist projects, including the Aryan Alternative newspaper." Referring to the recent news that a DNA test indicated that Cobb had African ancestry, Miller told Pakman, "I can't believe a man as intelligent as you, actually believes Craig Cobb is an octoroon. Surely, you know it's just another jewsmedia fraud." </TEXT>

In response to another redditor's query: **"What are some trends on reddit that should die?"**

Censorship.

In some reedits, censorship of legitimate news sources, users, and user comments based on the whim of rogue, self-appointed Moderators is now the norm, not the rare exception.

Yes, /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED]r , /u/[REDACTED] , and /u/[REDACTED](among others,) you Censorship Mods over at /r/[REDACTED] ban users and sources at individual whim. This has been well documented and will only become a larger issue until the Admins of reddit deal with the censorship dictates you Neo-Mods have forced upon the largest political message board on the Internet.

You deem sources "unacceptable" and they are pulled before they even hit the /r/[REDACTED]/new newsfeed.

As a redditor, I don't need some vigilante Mods deciding what is and what is not acceptable to their whim and censoring content "for our own Good." There are tens of millions of redditors, and we don't need authoritarian control over the means of our communication. We can decide for ourselves, thank you very much.

Salon is banned on /r/[REDACTED]. Wonkette is also banned. For a brief time, until reddit outrage grew too large to ignore and the Censorship Mods were forced to backtrack, Mother Jones was banned. (Mother Jones is the media outfit that broke the "Mitt Romney 47%" story, the biggest political story of 2012.) But the Censorship Mods were forced to back down when it blew up in their faces; they were made to undo their unjustified and partisan ban of Mother Jones. Other of their arbitrary bans remain in place to this day.

What sources are you not able to see, fellow reddit users, because the /r/[REDACTED] Neo-Mods have decided that they know better than you do what is and what is not news and/or politics? (Hint: more than you think.)

Reddit exists because of the free flow of information. When self-appointed guardians of what is valid and what is not seize control to impose their spiteful will by force upon an unwilling community, they are violating the very premise of reddit. This is why Admin intervention is needed: this Censorship train needs to be stopped in its tracks before it becomes a trend among other would-be authoritarian Mods.

The "Digg Patriots" destroyed digg; we cannot stand by as "Reddit Patriots" force the same fate on Reddit.

Don't let the Censorship Mods win. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He said something about "primate nocturnal" or something and declared it was his natural right to devirginize my new wife.

I know he's right, because he is richer and better and smarter than me. But does anyone know what he's talking about?

This is a disappointing start to our marriage. I can't make ice in the Liberty trailer, so the Liberty champagne I had specially chilled for our honeymoon night went warm while we used the ice to keep her swelling and bruising down.

She just arrived here from abroad last week. I hope this incident doesn't skew her perspective on LibertyWorld, where the natural rights of Propertarians reign supreme, and they harvest our Flowers of Freedom at will. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When did you first realize that Ron Paul was not in fact "a Champion of the Constitution" but nothing more than a Neo-Confederate grifter who exploits the paranoid fears of White Supremacists?

Did you fall for the "Hey, he's 'Grandpa Peace 'n Pot!'" rebranding that started online in the mid-2000s to cover up Ron Paul's past and his decades-long associations with the *Turner Diaries* crowd?

How long did it take you to get out of the Cult of Paul? Are people you know still in?

<TITLE> What does the future hold for the Republican Party? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-15 02:15:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dont know what the future holds for the Republican Party.

The Republicans, desperate to win at all costs, deliberately targeted both the malignantly ignorant, the dangerously paranoid, and all combinations thereof. This segment remains prized for both their malleability and their susceptibility to flag-and-eagle porn. Single issue voters, who will often vote in direct opposition to their own interests for the sake of litmus test issues, are really all the Republicans have left.

Beginning with President Nixon continuing right up until today, the Republican apparatus has catered ever more to these loons to secure victory. As a result, the paranoid and proudly ignorant now make up the largest segment of the Republican coalition, and traditional Eisenhower/Rockefeller Republicans are not only excoriated as "RINOs," they're viewed as prize game.

The Party now finds itself in trouble: it can no longer win national elections due to this self-cultivated demographic albatross, yet they now have no chance of winning without those voters. It's not merely a matter of their individual votes: these are the activists who man Republican phone banks, donate money, walk the precincts, and hand out lawn signs.

There really is no place for a sensible American conservative to seek shelter these days. The Libertarians are even more tied to the extremist American Right and its bizarre "black helicopter" conspiracy fantasies than the Republicans are, so there is really no refuge for a sane Republican moderate.

<TEXT> Does anyone have any DIY plans? Can I use a kerosene-driven motor? (We're off grid.)

I figure I can salvage an old refrigerator by cutting a hole in the top for his head and then sealing the gap around his neck with rubber from salvaged retreads (along with duct tape to make a good, tight pressure seal.)

Also, is it feasible to combine this setup with a composting toilet? If I can avoid opening the fridge door more than once a year or so to hose out his filth, I'd *really* like to avoid it. (I'm very self-reliant and it is going to be a *real* pain to aim the hose with one hand while manually pumping his oxygen bag with the other, especially with him hanging there by his neck/head like a baseball bat hanging in a rack.)

To be frank this is a **lot** more hassle than an rugged individual like myself is used to. What I really need are Volunteerists to preserve this young man's life. If you *insist* on compensation, I can throw a few Bitcoins your way once in a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ted in 1977, to *High Times* magazine:

"I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up."

Ted in 2013, to the media at a Las Vegas Gun Show: 

"But here is what is wrong with America today. We have a president, and everybody better write this down, and memorize this. The president of the United States goes to the Vietnam Memorial Wall and pretends to honor 58,000 American heroes who died fighting communism and then he hires, appoints and associates with communists. He pretends to pay honor to men who died fighting communism, and then he hangs out with, hires and appoints communists. He is an evil dangerous man who hates America and hates freedom. And we need to fix this as soon as possible."

<TITLE> Analysis: This was Mitt Romney's "Sister Souljah" Moment. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-12 00:03:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just as Bill Clinton distanced himself from the "Jesse Jackson" wing of the Democratic Party by criticizing Sister Souljah's Black Nationalist lyrics, Mitt Romney's criticism of "ObamaCare" [a deliberate, derisive term the American Right has sought to implant as strongly negative in America's id] was designed to get the NAACP booing at him, thus strengthening the resolve of his own Party's Obama-haters. This will get Mitt Romney donations and volunteers, as well as convey a much wider message.

The Republican dog-whistle: "if *those people* think 'ObamaCare' is good, *you* should hate it, because *'morbidly obese welfare queens in new Cadillacs with 8 kids with 8 different fathers buying vodka at the liquor store with Food Stamps'*."

Just think how many thousands of times Fox News and American Right SuperPACs will run this from this moment up until the election, reference it in their blogs, and AM-spam it 24 hours a day. Look at what they did with the "New Black Panthers" clip, for example.

To deny that this was a calculated move on the Romney campaign's part would be as foolish as denying that Bill Clinton's "Sister Souljah" speech was meant to clearly separate the modern Democratic Party from any association with the rhetoric of the Extremist Left of the late 1960s. (It's important to note that most people had never heard of Sister Souljah before, or since.) Both were messages sent out to/clearly received by their respective intended multiple audiences. </TEXT>

"What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposed of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).

You think the newsletters were bad? The fundraising letters were just insane from that period." [italics added.]*  Cato Institute President Ed Crane told reason he recalls a conversation from some time in the late 1980s in which Paul claimed that his best source of congressional campaign donations was the mailing list for The Spotlight, the conspiracy-mongering, anti-Semitic tabloid run by the Holocaust denier Willis Carto until it folded in 2001."

<TEXT> *By NBCs Anthony Terrell and Domenico Montanaro

CARROLL, Iowa -- Ron Paul outlined what he believed was the difference between Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party.

Some are demonstrating, because theyre scared to death they wont get their handouts, Paul said yesterday. And the other half are demonstrating, because theyre sick and tired of paying for it. Im on the side of sick and tired of paying for it.

Paul's popularity has risen since 2008 largely because of the Tea Party. He doesn't lead in polling in any state, but he is routinely in the top three in states like Iowa and New Hampshire.*

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1968: George Wallace and the "American Independent" party.

1980: Ronald Reagan convinces lower-middle class Americans that they will become millionaires if only they approve massive tax cuts for multimillionaires. The multimillionaires become billionaires; everyone else: the impoverished, the lower-middle class, and the middle class are forced to eat dirt, but persist in their belief Reagan is a American saint. 

1992: Ross Perot, to be followed by his "U-nited We Stand, America" party.

1994: Newt Gingrich and the "Republican Revolution."

1998: Newt Gingrich and the Clinton Impeachment. While he presided over the impeachment trial of Clinton for getting blown by a young staffer, Gingrich was himself getting blown by a young staffers (while he was on his second wife. That young staffer's name? Callista; she is now his third wife, and evidently quite fond of shopping at Tiffany's.)

2000: Ralph Nader decides that if Ross Perot could pull 20% of the vote in 1992 and 14% in 1996 despite being a complete whackjob, *surely* he could pull 5% in every state. Nader aligns himself with the "Green Party" in hopes of winning Federal matching funds. He was very much mistaken. He doesn't break 1% in *any* state, but he takes 91,000 votes in Florida; this is enough to throw Florida to George W. Bush.

2001-2009: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. If you don't remember the hell they unleashed, go look it up.

2008: Sarah Palin.

2010: The "spontaneous, up-from-the-grassroots" Tea Party movement. Realizing that Ross Perot won the rageful, spiteful votes of a certain segment of the American population, a motley crew of Republican political advisors, Libertarian brothers (and multibillionaires from birth,) join forces with a right-wing media billionaire to re-run the Ross Perot campaign, minus Ross Perot. 

2011: The "TeaPublicans" determine that they will "save America" by steering our ship of state directly off a cliff into a vast canyon. No sane American of any political stripe

<TEXT> We, as Americans, realize that our National Parks belong to all of us.

The same applies to the resources under our land and under our waters.

Why, then, do we lease out our lands and water to private, for-profit corporations who then extract America's natural resources, process them, and sell the products to right back to us, the ones that owned it in the first place? Every penny they've ever generated in profit comes from the resources they've extracted

Maybe it's time we spoke up for America and Americans, rather than worshipping at the altar of the Corporatists. They take our resources for *fractions* of pennies on the dollar, and sell it back to us at a truly astonishing markup.

It's one of the greatest scams ever, and it's gone on for nearly 125 years now. We give away *trillions* to them for next to nothing. If you want to get mad about something, get mad about this. Yet, there are those among us who would blame schoolteachers for our economic plight.

We don't owe any allegiance, nor profit, nor to these private, for-profit  interests. We pledge allegiance to the United States of America, not Exxon/Mobil, nor Shell, nor BP, nor Chevron, nor ARCO. Defend these private interests if you must, but don't delude yourselves that they can, have, or will *ever* show any allegiance to us in return for what we have so foolishly given away for so long.

Perhaps we should pledge our allegiance to ourselves, and our nation.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Punishing them makes us no wealthier.

We chronically undervalue our own financial worth anyway, and it doesn't look as if any of us will be getting a life-changing raise soon.

The solution isn't to tighten the thumbscrews on Congress; the solution is to value ourselves, and the work that each of us do for ourselves and  the nation.

One Congressman's salary sounds about equivalent to what it takes to provide a good, solid foundation, provide a reasonable existence, and a path to a comfortable retirement for a family of four. Let's use that as baseline, inclusive of health care benefits and vacation time.

Why? Because we're Americans, and we not only owe it to ourselves, we have quite literally *earned* it. 

America, you've earned a reasonable existence, solid health care, a few weeks of vacation each year with the kids, and stable golden years. The question is, are we American enough to accept what we've already earned for ourselves?

Value your own worth, and that of all of your American neighbors. My life as an American is a bit worse today, because somewhere within our borders today, one of my fellow Americans died from cancer that would have been caught years ago, had it been diagnosed. One of my fellow Americans ended his life today because he can't find work and would rather die than ask for help.

We've earned it. Are we American enough to accept for ourselves and each of our fellow Americans that which we have already earned?

Let's make this Fourth of July one to remember.

If every American resolves to honor each and every one of his fellow Americans *as* an American, there is no peak we cannot surmount. It's all that's united us and saved us before, and no one's changed the prescription.

We WILL get through this, if we honor one another, and treat ourselves and one another as we ourselves would like to be treated. Our grandparents and great-grandparents proved our resilience, and we could do far worse than follow the example of those we rightfully call "the Greatest Generation." </TEXT>

I will admit, though, that a moment or two to myself would be nice once in a while. Perfect example: after a meet-and-greet with the Jaycees this morning, I was followed into the Denny's restroom by a group of men in T-shirts, stained jeans, and mounds and mounds of facial hair. They kept talking about how Linus (the blanket kid from Peanuts?) could help us line up an account with the FedEx, something something involving gold, something about Fiats also (crappy Italan cars?) They were nice enough, maybe a little awkward socially, but seemed to be decent young fellows and dedicated to the cause of liberty. I finally sent them on their way by autographing ten or so toilet seat covers.

Well, back to it. Who knew so many of my fans were proficient in Gregg shorthand?

P.S.: left tip in doubloons.

<TEXT> Count me among those who say Adobe Flash is "the past." Other, far superior alternatives to Adobe Flash exist.

I've often wondered why those who hate Apple/the Mac/iOS and snidely label Apple's ecosystem a "closed, proprietary system" refuse to evolve and embrace the open standards of HTML 5. Yet, they scream like little children who've had their Popsicles stolen when obsolete Adobe Flash and *its* closed, proprietary system, a fossilized artifact of Web 0.3b, acquired via Adobe's takeover of Macromedia back in the 90s, are ignored in favor of far superior alternatives.

I really don't understand this bizarre fixation on Flash. Continuing to support Flash with all of its well-known and well-documented instabilities and security risks makes about as much sense as demanding that all programs in 2011 be written in Basic.

Seriously, *what's with this Flash fixation?*  Is it some sort of offshoot of Stockholm Syndrome? Do people believe that when Flash dies, their free internet porn will go away? [It won't.] If they even remember RealMedia/RealPlayer, did today's Adobe Flash sycophants feel the same way when Real's third-rate shit software and delivery capabilities [*Buffering . . . . . . Buffering . . . . . .* ] died from both obsolescence and user frustration at Real's utter ineptitude? Will anyone besides basement-dwellers who make drag-and-drop porn banner ads with Flash actually miss it?

Can anyone explain this? *What's with this irrational love for Flash?* You might as well demand that Apple support Betamax. </TEXT>

This whole thing is irrelevant, as due to the Hyde Amendment *not a penny of Federal money has gone to abortion services in decades.*

In private, when they're being honest, the Republicans have a greater and more snide contempt for anti-abortionists than does any liberal --but because of the political support the Repubs are happy to toss them a bone once in a while. Such is this "Planned Parenthood" red herring.

<TEXT> Do you guys realize that the Republicans/Koch Astroturfers are absolutely laughing their asses off at you behind your backs?

You guys think liberals think you're stupid? The Koch Republicans *know* you're stupid. What kind of fucking idiots (people who actually had their own taxes *cut* by Obama, though they believe the opposite is true) would actually go to their corporate-funded Uncle Sam cosplay rallies and scream about "socialist takeovers" because their multibillionaire masters will have to pay 2 cents more per dollar of income?

You think liberals mock you? Republicans *detest* you. They take great pleasure in grinding your faces into the shit and dirt, then tricking you into blaming the liberals for it.

Remember: the American Right uses you to do all their heavy lifting, which only serves their selfish interests while undermining yours. Do you believe they have any respect for those who would work like dogs against their own best interests?

It's a lot easier to print up ten million plastic American flags in China and pepper the crowd with a few puffy-shirted, tri-corner-hatted, out-of-work-actors shouting out Tea Party slogans mixed with misquoted Founders and "patriotize" you into doing their dirty work.

Remember, every time you see them talking about "taking America back" on TV or at a rally, ***they are all laughing their asses off at you*** the ***instant*** your backs are turned.* 

Painful but accurate analogy for you: if your personal liquid assetts are *less* than $10,000,000 and you buy into the "Tea Party" narrative, you're no different or less foolish than a black American marching in support of the KKK.    </TEXT>

Does anyone know? And if it is the same OS, why couldn't we run iOS4 on iPads today? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hackers have planted viruses in video games for smart phones running on Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system, according to a security firm specializing in mobile devices.

The games  3D Anti-Terrorist and PDA Poker Art  are available on sites that provide legitimate software for mobile devices, according to John Hering, chief executive officer of the San Francisco-based security firm Lookout.

The games are bundled with malicious software that automatically dials premium-rate telephone services in Somalia, Italy and other countries, sometimes ringing up hundreds of dollars in charges in a single month. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Republicans in Arizona Can End Illegal Immigration Tomorrow Morning. Here's How. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-04-29 22:29:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You want to end illegal immigration tomorrow, Arizona?

Put a $10,000 fineper illegal, per dayon everyone who HIRES an illegal.

Whoops! Bet that won't go over too well with the Republicans who race-bait you with this issue, would it? Their buddies in agribusiness wouldn't be too happy about it, for one. 

SOPick your own fucking vegetables, build your own fucking house, mow your own fucking lawn, make your own fucking food, bus your own fucking tables, wash your own fucking dishes, wash and iron your own fucking clothes, make up your own fucking motel rooms, and [scariest of all, I know,] WATCH YOUR OWN FUCKING CHILDREN. 

My $10,000 per illegal, per day fine on *EMPLOYERS* ends illegal immigration TOMORROW, Republicans. 

Bet your Party's big-ticket donations would dry up *very* quickly, eh? And you'd lose your favorite "DEY TURK YER JERBS!" argument.

Here in America we have a saying: Money talks, and bullshit walks. So, Republicans, are you going to go after the *real* reason illegal immigrants come here? They come because they're PAID to by your major donors, who must have their cheap labor. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why the Tea Party/Conservatives Hate Barack Obama More than Anyone, or Anything. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-04-23 17:46:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For decades, conservatives have preached the benefits of personal responsibility and explained human success or failure via a theory of Social Darwinism. By this logic, the good and noble of society rise and prosper; those left behind in society have only themselves and their lack of dedication and virtue to blame.

Conservatives have long been very free with their criticisms of others; they'll sneer at the destitute or unemployed and say, "[Ross Perot/Ronald Reagan/Chuck Norris] made it in life; that shows it's possible.  Why can't you, *loser?!* HAHAHA!"

Obama's election means only to them that they have to eat their own words.  If a black guy from a very modest background can become President, it only underscores that they themselves *aren't* President, or anything even approaching the same level of importance or prestige.

Worse still, it proves to them they don't even possess the skills or abilities to achieve such heights. It shows them they were outdone by a better educated, more diligent, more dedicated guya better educated, more diligent, more dedicated *black* guy. 

Since they are happy neither with themselves nor their station in life, Obama's achievements just serve to underscore their own personal failures. Subconsciously they apply their Social Darwinist thinking to Obama, then look at themselves; they *really* don't like the result of that matchup.

As President, Obama is on TV and in the news daily; they can't escape news, images, and discussions of him. Every one of Obama's successes only serves to underscore their own failures.  This is why they have to constantly tear him down.  It's their means of mental self-preservation.

Thus, they don't just hate Obama because he's black; they hate him because he's black and is "better'n [me.]" </TEXT>
