<TEXT> Big movies and music are now being regulated by the government to push for transparency, obedience, conformity, honesty, and science rather than entertainment or myth. No more Lady Gaga extravaganza.

Science fiction movies are now rooted in reality (tomorrowland, Jurassic world) because science fiction isn't something that's real, and they want to get away from not real, superpowers, myth, fantasy. And make things more science, Big Hero Six, The Martian.  

Celebrities are suddenly becoming political to make the world think politically correct about issues. 

Movies and music are getting away from the extraordinary and focusing on small things, the ordinary.  </TEXT>

For those opposing it, if the reviews are good, would that change your mind about seeing it? For those excited about it, are you seeing it Thursday or over the weekend?  </TEXT>
