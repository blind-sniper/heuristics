<TEXT> He says it starts out with a guy in the woods with a zombie tied to a tree and he's experimenting to see what gets a reaction from the zombie.  Says first 1/2 hour has very little dialogue.  Then you find out the plot of the movie is that the government created the zombie virus for population control and now they are going around killing the zombies, but some survivors are also part of the zombie pack being exterminated and now they are fighting for their lives.  Anyone?  Did he dream this movie?  Thanks in advance, it's driving him crazy trying to remember!
Edit: friend says movie poster is a distant silhoutte of a man carrying a hatchet into the forest... </TEXT>

<TEXT> welllll....besides the premise itself, they explain how awesome the security systems are.  Then the kids try to break in and Ethan hawke is like, "well ya know nothing's '100%' safe".  what???  Also it's not the son's first Purge right?  So why is he letting people in?  Why does the kid even have access to the security system to begin with?  Why would there ever be a scenario where for one night, do whatever you want,  because then for the rest of the year you'll be on your best behavior!  Then, it just turns into another lame american horror movie where all the bad guys HAVE to cock their head to the side while wearing a mask before they kill someone.  The girls HAVE to be in white dresses holding hands skipping around.  Pick an any American horror movie from the last ten years and I can almost guarantee it will have a young white girl in a white dress.  Then oh yeah the neighbors are psychotic killers too.  Shyamalan twist bitches.  It just, ugh was so bad.  Could have been a fun b-movie schlock fest but took itself to seriously.  the only reason I went in the first place was a second date with a girl.   That was our last date : )  And don't get me started on Sinister!  Why is there Academy Leader (the 3 2 1 countdown) at the beginning of the reels of footage?  Did the bad guy take the reels to get post production work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do post audio for movies/tv and let me tell you, it's not just comedies but ALL movies.  After the 'economy' in 2009, this has become the new standard.  It's either Avengers, or independent stuff that will show up on Netflix and people will pass over because they haven't seen or heard anything about it.   It sucks.  The company I work for are constantly getting underbid by people working out of their garages and then the clients eventually come to us to fix the problems.  The middle class really is gone.  We have a team of five full time staff and we have to do four movies at once to stay open.  But to be honest this whole business is screwy....I wish I had more answers, but it seems people are just cutting costs everywhere.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I startd the game almost exactly like this, except I actually got pretty far with my magic and no shield.  Hell go watch a no shield fists only run to give you some confidence!  

Dont worry the game is a little confusing as far as 'where to go next'.  But that's dark souls for ya!  I say NG is like a practice run through and the real game starts NG+.  Keep a notebook and write stuff down like, 'black door in forest area wont open'.  By the time you get the necessary items you will probs forget where to go to use them!


The lady in Majula will level you up by the bonfire. Defs get some strength to hold a shiled and get a longsword and level it up.  Start putting points in att and int.  Do a rounded charactwr with faith and int.  You will find a staff that will cast sorcereries, hexes AND miracles it's awesome.  Also for a first run, join the way of blue cove so if you get invaded, a blue sentinel can be summoned automatically to help you kill the invader.  You can be invaded while hollow now.....

Oh and talk to everyone!!  And....pull the lever </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bonewheel skeletons and Bed of Chaos for obvious reasons.
Also I have a problem USING homing soul mass.  I wish it 'homed' better.  If I'm facing two enemies with varying health, I wish it sent one, then two etc to kill first enemy, then used the remaining mass to kill second enemy, as opposed to sending all to enemy that is closest.  But I guess that how's 'homing missiles' work.  I also wished Dragon's Breath sent enemies flying like gravelord souldance.  I mean it's 50 INT and kind of a pain in the ass to get it should do more than it does.  
Also I hope in DS2 that if I'm locked on an enemy and they fall off a cliff, I lose my lock on them as soon as they are in the point of no return on the cliff edge.

<TITLE> So I joined the Forest Hunter Covenant recently......(questions) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-23 05:05:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just some quick questions/rant....Sorry in advance if these are 'basic' questions...
Never took the covenants too seriously mainly because I think of Dark Souls as a game vs man (singular)....Anyways, got all the way to Smough and Ornstein in Way of White without summoning another player besides the two Knights for Gaping Dragon who I ended up beating without their help anyways....Was having some 'difficulties' with Smough and Ornstein and decided to upgrade my weapons with Andre/Giant Blacksmith and then figured I'd stay around Andre and join the Forest Hunter and see what happens, mainly because I want ALL the rings....  Little drunk during the whole joining process with Alvina, but all of a sudden bam I'm invading and fighting and at 99k souls when my max ever had been like 30k!!  The past two days haven't been as awesome and here's my questions....

1. Is forest hunter all 2v1 ???  
2. Anyone that's human running through this area has a chance of being invaded by me regardless if they want to, right?  
3. Is it random who I invade?  
4. Are people waiting to be invading/summoning me, and if so how?
5. When I get close to someone so our shields can touch they're all of a sudden backstabbing me.  How do I do this?  I thought I was good at it....
6. Can I summon another Forest Hunter member to fight people?  
7.  Is there a better covenant for someone like me who likes a more 1v1 approach?  I just don't like getting ready to fight someone then all of a sudden another summon is behind me blasting me in the ass.
8. Where the hell do I farm Humanity???
9. And finally, is Dark Souls online experience just another example of online gaming these days?  Where's the humanity!?!?!
Thanks again, I'm on a PS3 and want to keep PvP-ing........ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like this!  I need to do this...After I beat the Hydra I kind of just sat there thinking how cool this game is, gazing upon the bottomless lake.  Went up the ladder without completely running around the lake for that golem.  Really trying hard not to use guides except for which weapons I shouldn't be wasting my shards and embers on.  Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm level 38, Sorcerer (hi strength, dexterity and intelligence)....Have beat Havel using parrying and backstabs, beat the Darkroot Hydra, and Moonlight Butterfly etc, but CAPRA DEMON !!  Such little space to move around and those dogs!  I can kill one by throwing firebombs over the gate before I go in, but when I go in he just steamrolls me.  Using Drake Sword and Dragon Crest shield....What else do I need to do?!?!

I stood next to a young woman at an airport baggage claim who was on the cell phone telling the other party that she was in fact "waiting for her shit" to come through the conveyor, then she would meet said party at the designated meeting area.   Presumably to talk shit about each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (cracks knuckles) Seeing's how I'm on an ADR stage and waiting for the next 'talent' I thought I'd join this whole ADR, Pam, Pan debate.  If anyone calls it 'Automatic Dialogue Replacement' it's cause you're on set, record a take but notice that an airplane sound (or dogs barking, or a car horn or anything NOT related to the sound sonically) is on the recording.  Well you like the performance but the audio is bad, so you will be "Automatically REplacing the Dialogue" later to preserve the shot.
Generally speaking you should think of ADR as ADDITIONAL Dialogue replacement".  Such as Voice Over (narration) or bad quality audio that you don't notice till the dialogue edit happens.  Or if you have to revoice an actor for various reasons.  Hope this helps!  ...and her name was PAM like the spray.
edit: Also LOOPING refers to the days when we still used film for the ADR stage, they would just loop the line over and over and the actor would say the line in a loop.  We still do it sometimes these days, but the word Loop just stuck.   </TEXT>
