<TEXT> I agree. Just felt the F-22 was better suited for dogfighting than the F-35. 

Found this decent comparison.

 F-22 and F-16 have two major things in common: both are relaxed-stability designs and both have LEX. As such, similar wing loading figures and thrust-to-weight ratios will result in similar maneuverability, especially since F-16 was designed to achieve optimum performance when two wingtip AAMs are present.

 With 50% fuel, 2 Sidewinder and 4 AMRAAM F-16C has wing loading of 392 kg/m2, thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,186 and weights 10 936 kg. F-22 has wing loading of 313,5 kg/m2, thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,29 and weights 24 579 kg. Thus, while F-22 will suffer maneuverability penalty due to its size and weight, it is unlikely that F-16C will be able to outmaneuver it.

 With F-16A it is a different story. With empty weight of 7 076 kg, it has wing loading of 349,5 kg/m2 and thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,29 (figures for 50% fuel and 2 Sidewinder). While its wing loading is higher than F-22s, F-16A is far lighter and smaller, so it is possible that it could be capable of matching the F-22. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hillary will have Republicans out to vote in record numbers and Democrats either staying home or moving to third parties in record numbers. 

What are her accomplishments? 

As a civilian, she was a member of Walmart's board of directors for 6 years fighting against living wages, benefits, gender equality, and the right of workers to organize.

As senator, she voted for the Iraq War, the bank bailouts, and the Patriot Act.

<TEXT>  Watch for signs on Texas multi-lane highways that read "Left Lane For Passing Only." These signs let you know that the left lane on a divided highway is not a "fast" lane; it is a passing lane.

 After you pass someone, move into the right lane once you've safely cleared the vehicle. Impeding the flow of traffic by continuing to drive in the left lane is punishable by a fine of up to $200.

<TEXT>  Blocking the left lane isnt only illegal  every state has some type of law restricting use of the left lane on multi-lane roads and highways  but keeping it open for passing causes fewer accidents than speeding because traffic flows more smoothly and theres less tailgating and less weaving in and out of traffic. Other benefits of not being a left lane hog include reduced road rage, better gas mileage and getting to your destination faster.

 Any time you get a disruption in the normal flow of traffic, you are apt to increase the chance of an accident to occur, says Lt. Gary Megge of the Michigan State Police.

<TEXT>  Benet Embry, a 43-year-old black resident, saw things differently.

 Embry has lived at Craig Ranch, a planned community in McKinney, for eight years. He said it's a nice place. Racially diverse. People get along there.

 He said when he was at the community pool Friday, a crowd of teenagers showed up, even though Craig Ranch's strict homeowners' association rules prohibit bringing more than two guests to the pool.

 The teens huddled by the gate and shouted to let them in. Some jumped over the fence, Embry said. A security guard tried to get them to leave but was outnumbered, so the guard called police.

 "Let me reiterate, the neighbors or the neighborhood did not call the police because this was an African-American party or whatever the situation is," he said. "This was not a racially motivated event -- at all. This whole thing is being blown completely out of proportion."

 Embry did say he was disturbed to see the officer kneel on top of the bikini-clad girl and wave his gun at other teens.

 "I may or may not agree with everything that the police officer did, but I do believe he was trying to establish order," he said. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  PLEASE HELP! That (now viral) video of the officer in McKinney subduing a girl in a bathing suit was in OUR neighborhood. The situation was NOT what is being reported


 A DJ setup in a public space next to the private pool in our neighborhood on Friday and played loud explicit (F-bomb) music for multiple hours (it is unclear if he was invited by a resident as no one has claimed responsibility). The teenagers (both black and white) were being brought into our neighborhood by the carload because the DJ was tweeting out invites to a pool party for $15 (obviously unauthorized by our neighborhood). The teens began fighting with each other and pushing their way into our private pool. Some were jumping our fence. The security guard was accosted when he tried to stop the beginnings of this mob scene. Some residents who live around the park/pool area tried to come out and settle things down. The teens started yelling racial slurs at our neighbors and started assaulting people and property (throwing bottles at cars and attacking a mother at the pool with 3 young children). The first officer on the scene was by himself. At that time, the party had grown to a large, aggressive crowd. As the officer arrived, many teens started running through our neighborhood. Many of the teens were being very aggressive and yelling at the officers as more arrived.

 This was a very dangerous situation for the officers AND the teens/residents not involved. The news media has refused to hear the neighborhoods side of this story. The video being distributed is only a very small segment of what happened. This information being distributed by the media and others is extremely distorted and in some cases outright lies.

 PLEASE HELP US STOP THE BROADCASTING OF THIS IGNORANCE. The media is trying to make it look like our neighborhood is a whites only, racist area. Anyone who has spent even a few minutes in our area knows this is an outright LIE.

 The unfortunate result is that our neighbors are now being threatened. We have also had cars and property in and around the park area vandalized this weekend. Unfortunately, the press and social media are trying to enflame the situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree! I believe when we build support for incremental bills like this we should always continue to inform people that the fight is not over. That this is not the cure. That there is still much to do. I just know once this bill gets passed you will hear things like, "They just passed that bill that requires the gov to have a warrant to collect your data. We won!" and that would be far from reality. So, when discussing bills like this we must fight for their passage but also press the fact that this is not over. We would still have many mtns to climb. Defense of the Constitution is a constant battle. Its under attack from all sides, every day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree it would be a move in the right direction but would passing this bill close the door on discussions of the gov still collecting data? I am afraid people will take this bill as, "They no longer collect our data." Which would be false. This could lead to the discussion losing steam and nothing ever being done about the gov collection. They do not need company DBs to collect your data. So, what is stopping that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reps. Ted Poe (R-TX, 2nd), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA, 19th), and Thomas Massie (R-KY, 4th) said in a statement Wednesday that the bill -- the End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans Act -- would force the government to get a warrant before it can access **databases** containing American data.

This statement worries me. Does this mean they can still collect the data but can only access it if they have a warrant? That would still mean there are large DBs with all of your communications stored in them. How would this DB be protected? What kind of safeguards would be in place to prevent malicious intent? 

I would prefer them not to store any data on Americans unless a warrant has been issued.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998.    

 "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998.    

 "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998.    

 "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998    

 "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998.    

 "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." - Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.    

 "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." - Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.    

 "There is no doubt that . Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001.    

 "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." - Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.    

 "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.    

 "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is using and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.    

 "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons." - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.    

 "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.    

 "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002    

 "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do." - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.    

 "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002    

 "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Boot the computer and when you see the Dell splash/bios screen immediately start pressing Ctrl+F11.

So, I am assuming that this disc from your friend was not a Dell OEM disk. Probably a retail copy.

Is there a Windows license sticker on the bottom of your laptop? Check under the battery, as well. Key retrievers will not give you the correct key on OEM installs, FME. Try to find that license sticker. If you find the correct key we may be able to use the retail copy of the DVD.

Try calling Dell support and requesting a reinstallation DVD. They *were* allowing 1 per customer but I am not sure how old your system is or if they are still doing this for Win7 machines.

If Dell will not ship you the DVD try locating a Dell Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit DVD. Ask your friends and family. If you can get your hands on this DVD it *should not* ask you for a key. </TEXT>

A few questions:    

What version of Windows was installed on the laptop when purchased? Windows 7 Home Premium? 32bit or 64bit?    

What version of Windows is your product key for?    

How did you restore it? What procedure did you use?    

Have you tried Ctrl+F11 just to make sure the recovery partition is no longer there? </TEXT>

**TO ANYONE READING THIS:**    
*If you purchase a new computer, please take a moment and create the recovery discs on first boot of a new system. Most manufacturers come with pre-loaded software and a recovery partition to create these discs.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> haha, I have never met a Christian that has said anything of the sort. Not saying they do not exist but I live in the bible belt. Grew up southern baptist. The major reason I see or hear is confusion. Older people like things simple. On one side you have people saying its bad for you. On the other side its the cure for all things. Then you have the government that classifies it as harmful as heroin. Now you have to understand that majority of these elderly people have probably never tried marijuana. They only know that the US government says its as bad as heroin and that the news tells them that people who smoke pot are potheads and lazy. These elderly probably grew up during the aftermath of the Reefer Madness days. Then you had the 60s anti war demonstrators and the hippies who were portrayed as anarchists, murders, soldier haters. etc. In my experience, religion is the least reason people in the bible belt are anti legalization. With all that said, where do the majority of elderly retire? The south....the Bible belt. So its a catch all for the elderly who in turn has anti marijuana views because of the way its been portrayed to them the last 70-80 years. Some people will vote against on religious grounds. The majority? Not so much.  </TEXT>

Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001.    

 "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." - Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.    

 "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.    

 "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is useing and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.    

 "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons." - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.    

 "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.    

 "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002    

 "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do." - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.    

 "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002    

 "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, Britain was obligated to defend neutral Belgium by the terms of a 75-year old treaty in WW1. The US had no obligation. Probably should have tried a little harder to keep your region in-check. Britain, well Europe in general, always seems to wait until it hits the fan to actually do anything and when they finally do something its sub-par at best. Look at the Balkans in the 90s. Europe sat around while millions of people died. Who finally did something about it? The US Military. </TEXT>

<TEXT> George Washington showed you what we think of your kind. 

One of the leaders of the American Revolution visited England after the war. His host entertained him comfortably, but was the sort of fellow who constantly disparaged America and Americans generally and never could get over the fact we had beaten them in the war.

To amuse himself and to twit his American guest, the host hung a print of George Washington in his outhouse. It had been there for a few days, and the host knew the American must have seen it, but he had said nothing. Finally overcome by curiosity, the host asked his guest what he thought of the picture of Washington.

"It is most appropriately hung," the American replied. "Nothing ever made the British shit like the sight of George Washington." </TEXT>

A racist is someone who believes in the superiority of one race over another, or who acts differently (usually negatively) towards a person or a group of people because of their race. A bigot is a blinkered, narrow-minded person, usually also very intolerant and unable to see anyone else's point of view. People can be bigoted about things that have nothing to do with race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally have watched multiple illegal immigrants get employed using false documents. We actually uncovered a document scheme at a company I used to consult for. A legal immigrant was providing stolen documents for illegal workers. Had been doing it for 10+ years. Had provided documents to 1000s of illegals. The documents being provided got them through eVerify with no problems. This is just one company I consulted for in the past. eVerify is only as strong as the border and enforcement. The point is, if you are breaking the law you should be held accountable. Whether its knowingly hiring illegal workers or being in this country illegally. If you are here illegally then you are breaking the law. Those that are breaking the law should be punished. Secure the border, fund and push enforcement, verify legal status and deport those that are here illegally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am saying that if you sign a contract then be prepared to deal with the repercussions. The entire argument of the cat or knees is irrelevant as it would be illegal to write that into the contract. You are grasping at straws. People should be able to enter into any contract they want as long as it does not affect someone else directly. If I sign a contract saying that I am being loaned $100 and that contract says that the interest will be 75% if I do not pay it back on time, who is the idiot? I would never sign anything like that. There are millions of poor people. Do you know why those millions of poor people do not rob the grocery stores on a daily basis? Because there are repercussions to robbing that store. You will go to jail. Repercussions for actions. Is it cool that poor people that cannot feed their families will go to jail if they steal a loaf of bread? not cool, no. but its reality.

If he was so down on his luck and could not afford to live then he should have sold his ipad, iphone, shut off his internet, his cable tv, and just got the basics in life. He chose to use payday loans because getting rid of the other "needs", they are wants not needs, was too unbearable to think of.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I grew up very poor. I was also very poor while I was in college. I lived on bologna, water, and kept my electric and water on. That was it. I did not go sign contracts I could not pay back. I scrimped by. I went without. I lived in the bottom of the barrel for most of my life. What I didnt do was take someone elses money without paying it back and then blame them for it.  </TEXT>

Maybe he was spending his money on cable tv, internet, ipads, etc. Maybe he saw the ad on the internet. If he was so broke, he should not have had anyway to post on Facebook before his death. When I was broke I had electricity, bologna, bread, and water. That was it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I would say it is the most secretive White House that I have ever been involved in covering, and that includes  I spent 22 years of my career in Washington and covered presidents from President Reagan on up through now, and I was Washington bureau chief of the Times during George W. Bush's first term. I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Jill Abramson / Jan 2014

The real reason she is no longer at NYT, IMO. NYT has become nothing more than a media arm of the Obama admin.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And my original comment never said his point was invalid. I think your anger is really because I do not salivate at the thought of Harry Reid or Dick Cheney. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I was a person in the streets protesting the war. Protesting both parties for what they had done. I believe that both parties are culpable for our current state of affairs, including the Iraq debacle. Both sides disregarded many people from the international community that told us the intelligence was wrong. Both sides did not listen and got us involved in one the biggest foreign policy blunders in our nations history. I do not get caught up in the party paradigm so I guess its just easier for me to hold all elected officials accountable for their choices. I wanted the Bush administration investigated for war crimes. Thanks to the Obama administration we will never see that either. You fail to realize that both sides are to blame and so you come here and attack me for stating a fact. Whether his point was correct or not hes not really in a place to say anything as he is just as culpable. As I see you see things through a very biased set of eyes I feel this conversation continuing will get neither of us anywhere and just waste my time. I will forever hold both parties to blame for the Iraq debacle and nothing you say will change that. I lived it. I protested it.  </TEXT>

He voted to authorize the use of Military force in Iraq giving Bush and Cheney the green light for their pointless war. I just find it odd that someone who gave Cheney the authority to go into Iraq is bashing him for going into Iraq.  </TEXT>

Yes, people should be held responsible for the decisions they make. Especially a Senator that has the power to hold those responsible for falsifying intelligence and lying to Congress yet fails to do so.

<TEXT> Because I would expect r/politics to be unbiased views from all sides of the political spectrum. Instead r/politics has turned into r/democrats or r/obama. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I just like to see two sides of the debate. Which should be what r/politics is all about. But all you have to do is look through r/politics and understand what types of stories that are allowed to be discussed. Of course you may be biased yourself and not care or not see it. Everything in r/politics has a one sided bias towards politics. What does r/politics expect to get out of having an agenda? what do they expect to get out of everyone sitting around with the same opinions and ideas? I would call it a circlejerk. Its obvious to middle of the road people like myself. r/politics = r/democrats and if you believe otherwise you are either lying to yourself or you havent been here long enough. But you are right. Why do I continue to stay? I guess I just hoped at some point unbiased views would come along but when the moderators are so biased themselves and have their own political agendas its difficult to have have unbiased middle of the road political discussions. Moderators of r/politics flag posts right out of the gate if they do not align with the agenda of the left. Moderators downvote articles that do not necessarily break any rules but go against their personal agendas. Its sad really. I believe both sides of the political aisle are just as culpable for our current state of affairs. But you wouldnt know that reading r/politics. Not that the facts arent out there, its because anything that shows the left in a bad light gets shadow banned, pulled, or downvoted before a discussion can even take place. r/politics should promote both sides of the aisle and many opinions and ideas. If r/politics was the same towards the right I would have just as much of an issue with it. I cant stand political parties and it bewilders me how we can expect to move forward as a nation as long as we sit around in our own little circles pointing the finger at one particular party. But you have made me realize that no one in r/politics cares about the things i just mentioned so I guess you are right. I should unsubscribe and leave you all to your circlejerk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gross violations of our Constitution are not "minor issues" in my view. They are the most pressing issues IMO. Economic issues will work themselves out as both individuals will have a vested interest in our economy since they both rely on the economy to survive. I also believe they could find common purpose on economic issues. After what this country has gone through in terms of Constitutional violations in the last 14 years that has become my above all voting condition. Both parties have very similar overall views of economic policy. This is why policies have not changed very much in the last 30+ years. Its the issues such as Constitutional violations that have changed dramatically in the last 30+ years and have detrimental long term effects. Including on the economy. It is being speculated that the NSA revelations will cost American tech companies billions in lost revenue, annually. I believe these two men could find common purpose and do great things for the people and the Constitution of this wonderful nation. I just like to think outside the box. I mean what we have been doing surely isnt working for the people. So why not try something different? I am not a Republican or Democrat. I am just an American that cares about his country and I can see that something drastic and unrealistic may be our only chance at righting some of these wrongs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you believe that men that have two different core ideologies cannot find common ground move forward based on those common principles? Is that not the foundation of our government? Is Congress not setup to compromise different ideologies into one common goal or purpose. I reject the notion that just because they have different core ideologies that they couldnt come to a compromise on the best way to move the country forward. There are issues that need to be addressed such as NSA, Military engagments, NDAA, Patriot Act, etc where they could really lead the charge. The gross violations of our Constitution from both parties is appalling and I believe that as long as we continue to vote for the establishment we will get the same policies. I am just ready to think outside the box. We need men like Bernie and Rand to take on the political parties in this country. Both have a knack for going against the grain. I just believe as Americans we can do anything. We can find common ground and move our country forward. This is why I refuse to believe that these two could not find a common purpose. </TEXT>

Bush's first term. I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Jill Abramson / Jan 2014

<TEXT> From my conversations with Dell regarding this specific type of case - Windows 8 machine with Windows 7 downgrade - this is supposed to work.  The new Dells that are set up like this no longer come with Windows 7 COA License key stickers. (and of course Windows 8 keys are stored in the bios) Dell says to use the OEM Windows 7 disk so that it will auto-populate the license key when installing Windows 7. Of course I will also recommend creating the Dell recovery disc on first boot up. Dell recovery is the best way to recreate the system as it was from the factory. But if a disc must be used OEM should do the trick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. The moderator that removed it, IMO, had a biased reason to do it. The link worked from the time I posted it. I didnt edit the post and I tested the link numerous times. Even after the moderators looked at it the link worked. This is my biggest issue with this sub. Its clearly biased towards one party which stifles conversation on a broad range of ideas. Feinstein is a Democrat. The moderator that removed it is surely a Democrat, Feinstein supporter, or trigger happy.

<TEXT> I cannot force a company from overseas to continue to buy my product at an increased price. I can increase wages but I have contracts on product pricing. The customers that buy my products would buy from manufacturers overseas instead because they could get them cheaper. Does that make sense? We are not a US Economy. We are a world economy. My entire business is based on customers not based in the US. If my costs go up so does my product cost. My contracts would disappear leaving my company out of business and my employees out of a job. For the record Labor is one of the largest costs of making products. you seem to shove it aside as a non existent cost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol What you fail to understand is that if my labor costs change overnight I will be out of business in a month. Labor costs would be immediate. Revenue increases would not. I would be out of business before I ever saw a revenue increase. But you fail to understand that if my labor costs increase so does the cost of my product. So if the cost of goods increases where is the increase in pay? They will just be paying more for goods which would deplete any increase in pay they were afforded. You think things are black and white.. they are not. You can make it look good on paper all you want. Reality is it would be detrimental to our economy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. The most effective change needs to be done on the State level. Which is how our country is supposed to work. We do not need a larger federal government making general policies for everyone without understand what effects it has on individual local economies. Everyones needs are different. Plus I do not think we grasp the problem enough to implement broad federal changes at this point.. Things need to be done on the state level and done with what is best for that States environment. The problem with this is citizens always try to make change on the federal level. The biggest impact we can have is starting local and seeing what works best for individual communities. Things that work will translate into general public policy.  </TEXT>

If 1000 people lose their jobs that will be a much larger drain on the community than having people work, pay taxes, be provided health insurance, retirement plans (which we match), etc. Take that away and the local economy would be drained from all of the extra social services and less tax revenue. Tell your local commissioners to have all companies like mine shut there doors. Then come back and tell me what happens to your economy once this happens. You think its bad now it would be catastrophic doing things your way.  </TEXT>

You do realize US manufacturers have to compete with 3rd world countries correct? So we have to keep a balance or people will lose their jobs and be even worse off. This is not black and white.

So they would become an even more drain on the social system than they already are. If they want to make more money. They need to go get training and learn a skill that demands more money. And if increasing worker pay causes inflation to the point where the increase in pay is depleted by inflation cost in goods purchased then they would be in the same place they are now. Still requiring subsidies. On top of that my company pays out $millions$ in healthcare costs to subsidize the employees healthcare. Just like many businesses do. If we did not subsidize their healthcare they would be an even bigger drain on  social services.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I can only speak from a manufacturing standpoint. And if I remember correctly we are trying to ramp up manufacturing in the States. This would cause us to lose out to countries with lower labor costs. The only heavy turnover I get is from people that just don't like to show up to work. Workers cant go get a better paying job doing the same thing at other manufacturers either. Cause they are in the same boat as me. We are actually replacing workers with machines to increase productivity. I will not create work ethic for someone else. If they want a job and work hard they will get hired. If they do well I will look for ways to promote them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.  
  
This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.  
  
The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty."

<TEXT> All I heard from Kerry yesterday is that we must "protect Israel".. How about we let Israel protect themselves for a change. We have had too many American brothers and sisters killed or maimed protecting Israel while the Israelis sit on their couch and watch. You are the Secretary of State for the United States of America, not of Israel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They took an oath to protect the Constitution, the United States, and its people. Standing up for the Constitution should not be looked at as activism. They are upholding their oath.

<TEXT> "Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process." - ChangeDOTgov  

This excerpt above was pulled from the site 2 days after the Snowden revelations.  

Obama has used the Espionage Act to charge more whistleblowers than any past President combined.   </TEXT>
