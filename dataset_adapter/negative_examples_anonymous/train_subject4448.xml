Same here. The Spurs may not be their favorite team, but they respect us. And about the "boring" part the OP mentioned, we've always been low key compared to the other superstars. But that's how we do things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing the game on the iPad for eons, and while it crashes occasionally, a restart does the trick. 

This morning, when I woke up and started the game, it would just crash after the Lex Luthor quote. Over and over again.

I even uninstalled it, but same thing. I restored a backup of the iPad, hoping the issue would be fixed, but to no avail.

Anyone has the same issue and/or a fix? </TEXT>

Indeed, and there are even sites which have levels for writers. X amount for 'poor writing', XX amount for 'good enough writing', etc.
I don't remember what site this was, but when I saw it some months back, I was appalled.

The market is that bad, that yes, you can earn as a "writer" even if you can't write. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to disagree with "never working for free". There are cases when working for free has its own rewards.

When you're new, working for exposure can help - but not too often, and you have to be picky about where you write.

If it's a non-profit or a charity, working for free helps with exposure AND you get to help others.

There *is* something to saying "don't work for free", but "never" is too sweeping a statement in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting point of view. I remember reading a story about a boy whose father was an elephant herder, and the point of it was that an elephant never forgets - in a positive way. I don't remember all the details as I was very young then, but the young boy used to play with a young elephant and years later, in the midst of an elephant stampede the then adult herder was saved by the adult elephant, who never forgot.

But I ramble...your post is a good reminder. Thank you. </TEXT>

As for bullying, part of Hollywood and society in general - even online. It's admirable that she's doing something concrete and useful to battle the issue instead of just whining and starting flame wars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is more amazing then a moment spent hugging your child?  Or watching him laugh with all his heart in a way only children can.  Or a touch and a smile from your spouse that says more than words ever could?  Or an intimate moment shared that no one else will ever know about.  There is so much beauty in each moment and there will never be another exactly like it.  Its those things that are most rare that have the most value, and there are only so many moments that we get.  Choose to believe that you cant waste time with your spouse, because no moment with them can be a waste.  There is value in every second together.

I thought I had had a good balance, but am totally wrong. So point 2 ( Introduce non-computer centric activities) is what I am working on right now, which is quite difficult because my non-work activity is mainly playing mobile games and reading (still on a mobile device).

I'm working on taking a 1-hour work at least once a week, but I don't know if that's going to stick.

<TEXT> I suggest Vikings (pretty much the Nordic version of Spartacus in my opinion - wait there's no Spartacus on your list, so you may want to see that, too).

Then there's Salem, which is sometimes slow, but has its moments; and the premise might appeal to you.

Sleepy Hollow is pretty good, too.

For tech TV, try Silicon Valley for humor/caricature of well, Silicon Valley; and then there's Halt and Catch Fire (the start of personal computing in the 80s), which has a more serious tone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Also, at times like this it can be really hard to want to spend time with other people, but see if there's a friend or family member who you can spend some time with, just talking, and sharing. Having someone with you will make things that much better to cope with.

This is paramount and very effective if you make sure you're surrounded by people who truly believe in you and do not bring you down (even in unintentionally).

Chin up. You'll get through this.

<TEXT> He likes some of the DC characters, and I'm pretty sure he'd like the voice prompts (Quinn: "Got a booboo?"). While he wouldn't be much good at winning and leveling up, I think the swiping actions he'll enjoy a lot. Also, he loves emulating Ip Man, and I have a feeling he'll do the same with the characters of Injustice. That would be funny to see, but that's also what made realize that it might indeed be too early to introduce the game... </TEXT>
