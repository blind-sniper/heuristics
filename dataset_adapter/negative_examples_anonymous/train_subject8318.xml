<TEXT> I gotta go with The Lost World, man. People are hard on it, but I loved it so much when I was a kid. The Lost World is an absolutely badass movie. To me, it's like the *Aliens* of the Alien franchise. 

I remember going to the theaters to see JP3 when I was 7 and thinking it just wasn't as good as the first and second. I was really young, but I knew. I felt it in my heart. It didn't have the magic that Spielberg brought to the table. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's someone who takes himself very seriously. He is a very talented artist. I think his overconfidence has caused him to say a lot of things that have gotten him into trouble. But it also causes him to create a product and a message that he truly believes is God-like. The loyal consumer appreciates how seriously he takes himself because it means he ALWAYS presents a good product. I think he feels like he has something to prove because he is one of the most hated men in the world, while simultaneously being one of the most admired and influential artists. He's kind of a weirdo. He's always saying stupid shit(you know it's true...) But it's a hell of an interesting story to see this eccentric family (Kanye   the Kardashians) trying to live normal lives in a a world where they a preyed on by the media. I personally think Kanye is so awesome and I admire his story.  I love how Kanye has had such a tough time with the media.  It's like he's in a constant war with the media over the status of his reputation. He's a fighter. I like that. And his music is fucking awesome and genre-defining. And I think he has good taste. I think some of the Adidas line is awesome. He's a real artist. And he has a crippling ego. But I don't blame him; I bet it's way more fun to live that way. I'd choose to live like a God, too. Wouldn't you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damn lucky. I wish something like that was in Phoenix (or literally anywhere in AZ). I checked on ebay and they're going from $90-$800. Anybody know of any other options for someone to get a copy? A past time of mine is to chill and look at look books(I recommend the free Vans look books you can get at the Vans stores). Any clever ideas?? Any high quality scans? High quality printer shops? If somebody reads this and has any ideas where I can get stuff like this, I would love you. 3
thanks fam

edit: I might even want to compile high quality scans of look books for people to DL. Print media is awesome. I want to get my hands on the Odd Future look books too.

I got really stoned once and watched Breakfast at Tiffany's for the first time and I thought it was so cool I immediately went out and bought a big poster of Audrey Hepburn. I moved back home and I still have it above my bed, even though my family gives me strange looks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I posted this. I've been having some very grown-up thoughts lately. I'm 20 years old, and I've been an atheist as long as I can remember. I, like what seems like most people on the internet, always thought that religion is stupid.


This year, I've been revisiting some of my ideals. I became obsessed with space after watching 2001, the Cosmos, Contact, and Interstellar. The way I viewed the universe started to change. Are the scriptures all just gypsies and fairies, or is there any truth to be found? What is beyond the universe, and why did we come into existence? It's almost like I went full circle with my beliefs. Concepts that always seemed impossible to me now make more sense than ever. Marijuana and the art of film has given me a newfound spirituality. Pi and The Last Temptation of Christ gave me remarkable insight into what religion actually could mean. I thought that believing in God was close-minded. Now I wonder: is being an atheist the real close-mindedness? Shutting out all religious ideas doesn't seem 100% logical to me.


So tell me: ***Does God Exist?*** Has anyone else struggled with their sense of religious identity before? If anyone has any good science to bring to the discussion, that'd be great. Think philosophically, atheists. What lies beyond? Nothing? What could lie beyond? Could our consciousness transcend this dimension into another? Could extraterrestrial life be our biblical "God"?


Thank you! (I love having my mind blown!) :) </TEXT>
