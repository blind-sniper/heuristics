My relatives take in kangaroos after they have been orphaned, abandoned or injured. 

They have been doing this for 10-15 years and have never asked for donations, but as carers across the state are running out of space they would like to extend their kangaroo yard to be able to take in more kangaroos in need.

Please help if you can, any amount will be accepted with enormous gratitude! 

thank you!

Also, please check out their facebook page to see where your donations will go to https://www.facebook.com/eyrepeninsulakangaroorescue </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in a rural areas a know many farmers, there are some who view kangaroos as pests and put up fences and shoot them.  And there are some that don't think of them as pests and don't even have fences and definitely don't shoot them and have no problems with crop damage.  

These people are from the same area,  they very likely have the same numbers of kangaroos on their properties. The 'pest' label is largely based on opinion from what I can tell.  

Edit: there are no reliable studies to show that kangaroos are pests.  </TEXT>

A lady i know who has kangaroos found a joey on the ground right after it was born,  she popped it in the pouch and it survived but I'd assume there are plenty that aren't so lucky. 

Edit to add : the joey this lady found had the cord wrapped around its hands so it wasn't able to grip the fur.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, 

I'm just wondering it there are any other teachers/pre-service teachers here with anxiety? I am starting my first week of placement next week and am getting pretty bad anxiety thinking about it. It's something completely new for me and I don't know how to deal with it. 

I will be working in a kindy (pre-school) with kids aged 3-4, a good age I think, which will make things easier, but I'm still worried. 

any advice or stories from others in this situation would be very much appreciated! thank you </TEXT>

Don't say your opinion is the right one or the best one. 

Talk about stuff in casual and friendly conversation or polite debate. 

Don't take every opportunity you get to advocate for whatever it is,  or people will get annoyed/ bored with it. 

Bring it up in appropriate places and at appropriate times.

Be understanding of why others don't feel the same as you. 

Don't be forceful.

Be honest.  </TEXT>

Everything was pulled in. Blood and pain. So much blood.  So much pain.  So much.  

I almost called my sister to help me,  I was imagining having to go to hospital and have the rpilator surgically removed. But I would have died from embarrassment. So I got scissors and cut away all the hair that i could then yanked the epilator and the remaining hairs + some skin off. SUCCESS! 

never ever epilate down there.   </TEXT>

On a related logic: why does human kind have to evolve in one specific region of the world, and then migrate to the rest of it?

It doesnt 'have to' but all the evidence we have suggests that it did.  Like most other life forms,  there are kangaroos in Europe and there aren't bears in Australia. Different regions create different things, its going to be pretty unlikely that the exact same animal will evolve in two separate locations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont think it's shady, people swap doctors etc. all the time for lots of different reasons. 

It does make sense, that we haven't adapted to this high pressure, academic kind of lifestyle, which is why I think a psychologist would be useful to see, because it is stressful and discouraging at times. But on the other hand, if you do have ADHD, medications really really do help. But some people don't take medication for it and work on other calming and focusing techniques. 

Do a bit of research and read through other threads on this subreddit for ideas of how to deal with studying, and work out what you think will be best for you. 

It is a pretty confusing situation, with the different opinions on ADHD out there. I honestly didn't really think it was real until I was diagnosed and saw improvements in my studies on medication.

<TEXT> oh wow, thats expensive. Sorry it didn't go as planned. 

I'm not exactly sure what you should do. Maybe try a psychologist but keep searching for a better psychiatrist. It's excellent that you got the referral and the appointment so easily though, maybe you will be equally lucky in the future. 

I just did a quick google search, and it looks like there are quite a few psychiatrists in brisbane who specialise in adult adhd. Write up a list of names of any close to you and take that to your doctor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah, demand that referral, it really sounds like you need it. 

It sounds exactly like what I go through, the coloured notes, taking for ever to get work done and being too alert of my surroundings. exactly the same. so annoying. 

I didn't research drugs much, but my psychiatrist did give me some information sheets on the different ones available. its excellent that you've been researching it, I think it really shows that you're taking this seriously, I hope you doctor sees that. 

I think it's a good idea to take in your uni work, you might not need to show it, but it's good to have 'evidence', i dont think it will work against you. 

Good luck with your doctors appointment. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> my psychiatrist gave me a few options for medication, but I only recognised dex, so i chose it just because of that and he didn't have anything bad to say about it. 

I know how you feel, about putting so much effort in to everything, it gets really tiring, it's not fun at all.

I'm not sure if psychologists can give referrals or not, sorry. But my psychiatrist recommended I see a psychologist as well as take the medication. I only had one appointment though, I wish I'd stuck with it, but I just couldn't be bothered I think. it wouldn't be a bad idea to look into seeing a psychologist too, and I believe you get 10 free sessions a year. 

Just be honest with your doctor, and be demanding if you have to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd suggest you start looking now, and try and find one that will specialise in ADHD, when I was searching I found that there were quite a few around so hopefully you don't have any difficulties with that. It's just that some don't believe in ADHD for whatever reason, my cousin sees one who doesn't believe in it, but she lives rurally so has no other options, he's very rude and condescending. 

The dosage and type of medication will vary. I chose dexamphetamine, and my psychiatrist recommended I start on 20mg a day and then increased it to 25 after a while. It will depend on your body and how severe your possible ADHD appears.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep,  the script is for 6 months worth of medication. the wait for psychiatrists is generally a few months, it was three months between getting my referral and having my first appointment.  I'd recommend you get onto it soon because it's likely you'll have a long wait also. 

Try not to worry about what other people think. This is your life and you have to do what's best for you,  its hard not feeling good enough,  constantly failing or struggling. Get to a psychiatrist asap, and even if it turns out you don't have adhd, I'm sure they will be able to help you in other ways.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's probably different with different psychiatrists, but my first appointment was 1 hour, where he got me to answer a bunch of questions, then we discussed my family history, my personal/social/student life and such. when he had determined that I indeed did have ADHD, he told me about the different medications and therapies available. He recommended that I go on medication because it was really affecting me, i was failing uni classes, so I chose to go on dex, just because I'd heard about it before. 

the appointments after that were only half hour ones, where he asked for an update, gave me my new prescription, then we talked politics until the time was up. 

I thought it was good that he gave me option other than medications, but that he recommended that I take them.

<TEXT> I think it's fine, and it is what I did. Doctors are there to help everyone. You are hopefully just over-thinking this and it will actually be a very simple process getting into a psychiatrist. 

It sucks that there are those people out there who ruin things for others, but hopefully medical professionals can tell the honest ones from the liars. 

Also, my psychiatrist charged $70 and my appointments were every six months, so it was pretty affordable, but I was getting youth allowance and had a centrelink health care card for the medication discount (something like $5 down from $30) - if any of that helps. 

Explain everything to your doctor if you feel the need, or if she asks, like your mother not believing in it, having to save up, be honest and open about how your studies are affected.

<TEXT> I'm Australian too. If you're really concerned about being judged, you can say it's for your mental health in general. University can be very stressful even without additional difficulties with ADHD. If you aren't lying to get your referral, I suppose it doesnt matter which one you go with. 

Also, I looked up psychiatrists in my area that dealth with ADHD, as some wont, or don't think it exists. important to find someone who will listen to you. 

Although, if your doctor is half decent she shouldn't be judging your reasons for seeking a psychiatrist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not an expert at all, but I would say it's definitely worth getting checked out. 

I worried about that too, people assuming I just want drugs, but my psychiatrist asked me a lot of question, about family history and everything, and I suppose I could lie about everything, but he seemed certain that I had ADHD and thought it was unfortunate that I hadnt got diagnosed earlier, because I really fell behind in school. He then told me that dexamphetamines can sell for up to $10 per 5mg, which seems like a lot, but I didnt find out. 

I would tell your doctor that you believe you have ADHD, maybe do a few online tests (I know they are diagnostic, but there are pretty accurate ones out there) and take the results in, I did that and the doctor agreed that I should be checked by a psychiatrist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You sound a lot like me, very very similar problems. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 23 after suspecting it for a few years. 

I think you should tell your doctor that you want a referral, not ask her, but straight up tell her. She can't refuse to. 

But also ask her about ways to help your memory and organisation, because learning those things is really important to, and she might have some good techniques that can help.  </TEXT>

This is a pictute of me before   starting day 1 of 'Zombies 5k' 
I've tried and failed to lose weight numerous times over the years (im 25, been overweight since my early teens ), but i recently reached my highest weight ever and i realised how important it is to get healthy and lose this weight.  My starting weight was 107kg in November, since then i started the keto diet and am now 97kg. Now I'm increasing my exercise. 

Im hoping  that by sharing this that I will  have more motivation to stick to my weightloss this time and finally be successful, i want to put a progress picture alongside this one and see real change in my body. I want to lose this weight and I'm going to lose this weight.  Hold me to my word reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was asked recently and someone gave a good answer that was really easy to understand.

Edit: " Although there were many other females living at the time of Mitochondrial Eve, none of them were able to produce a direct, unbroken line of females to any present-day woman. In other words, all the other women at the time either died or gave birth to only males at one point in their lineage. Since mitochondrial DNA is only passed down through females, all these other lineages met dead ends if a mother gave birth to only sons. Mitochondrial Eve is the only female who produced a lineage of women that lasts up to this day. Thus every female alive today can trace their mitochondrial DNA back to this lineage." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes it's just a side effect, not necessary, but not avoidable either. Such as bombing industrial areas, ships etc to hinder the enemy, there will likely be many people/workers at the location that are killed as a result.  

Killing also obviously reduces the number of people to fight against giving you better odds at winning. 

In a lot of cases it isn't necessary but gives a strong message of power, and can hasten the end of war.  The bombing of Hiroshima  killed many in awful ways but possibly  prevented far more deaths by ending the war sooner.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have never been the most important person to anyone. I've never felt like I'm needed, just me, for filling a space in someones life that no one else could. Everyone in my life has someone else that could easily take my place and it makes me feel so useless. 

I know there are people who care about me and love me, but they also care about and love other people equally or more. 

I feel like if I was in that sinking boat scenario with a few other people, I would never be one of the people chosen to live...

Edit: Thank you for the replies, they have truly been very helpful. In really dark moments, when it feels like no one cares at all, it's amazing to know that people, even strangers, are there to help. I'm taking on a lot of what has been said and I can already feel the difference it's making.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking this same thing recently, and came to the conclusion that we need both subconscious and conscious control of our breathing or we would quickly die. 

for example, if we always had only conscious control of our breathing, we would die as soon as we fell asleep. 

and if it was only unconsciously controlled, we wouldn't be able to hold our breath, like if we were underwater, our body would be in control and continue to try and breathe.

<TEXT> Some people are over weight due to medical reasons, illnesses, medications, syndromes can cause sudden rapid weight gain. 

my cousin gained a lot of weight recently and was diagnosed with PCOS, she had been skinny her whole life to that point and the weight gain caused her to develop severe depression,  which she is now medicated for, side effect of the medication is weight gain.  

She is overweight,  but shouldn't be shamed.  If you shame all fat people,  you're also shaming people who honestly have very little control over their weight.  She's losing weight but it takes a hell of a lot longer and is a hell of a lot harder to lose it than gain it.  

But also, shaming people isn't going to change them,  or help them, it just makes them feel awful.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> throughout my teen years I didn't care about germs at all, I hardly ever washed my hands, even after touching things like bus seats, covered in all kinds of gross. I would get mildly sick about once every 18 or so months and only for a day or two.

since I've started to wash my hands regularly and I'm not going out in public as often, I get sick every few months. 

so, exposure to 'germs' plays a part in building a strong immune system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a student with adhd and depression things were generally a struggle. 

I was falling behind in one subject, but one weekend I was determined not to fail and spent all my energy working on and finishing two assignments. It was hard, but I did it and I was really proud of myself. I handed the assignments up on the Monday. 

 After a week or so, I hadn't got any response from the teacher so I asked him if he'd marked them yet. He said:

"I haven't looked, I'm not wasting my time because I don't know if it's worth it" 

Crushing. It's been 10 years since he said that and it still brings me to tears.  </TEXT>

Maybe try a different doctor, some are insensitive, some are really good, I learned this though experience, it took me about 5 doctors until I found one that actually cared about me. You might be able to ask others from your area (online?) if they can recommend someone really good for you to see.

Suicide is not your only option.

<TEXT> In South Australia hand raised kangaroos can not be released into the wild and males must be desexed. I dont know the laws in the other states.

They are loving animals, and make great companions but not great pets, they have poor immune systems and can die suddenly without presenting any signs of illness, so it can be difficult to treat them for illnesses, they cause a lot of heartbreak, my friends who care for kangaroos probably lose two to everyone one that lives, it doesnt get easier, it's awful every time. They also bite (HARD) a lot, and kick and can't be toilet trained or anything, and need a lot of space.  </TEXT>

As an Australian, I never learned much about the way aborigines were treated after European settlement until I started university. At school it was all "they do dot paintings and use boomerangs". In uni I learned about the massacres, raping, stolen generations, them being classed as fauna, so many horrors.

Starting a fire during this weather means a person is either an unbelievable idiot or evil (or both). The world can do without those people.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks! 
that's a lot of info, I don't understand much of it, but I will do some research based on what you've told me. and I'm currently downloading Stellarium, which looks pretty neat and might keep me up all night. 

I've edited my original post to include some photos. 

As I'm new to telescope use, honestly, just looking at the moon is exciting, but knowing there is so much more to see... I want to be able to see it. 

I'd happily save up to buy a new telescope, but because this one was my papas, I want to be able to use it but make it better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandfather was a keen amateur astronomer, and owned a few telescopes, he passed a few years ago but only recently has one of his telescopes been found (no idea where the others are/ if they still work)

I know absolutely nothing about telescopes, but am interested in astronomy. 
the label on the telescope reads:

 Denkar Astronomical Reflection Telescope

D- 3" F=600mm 

coated optics

and the bit you look through says "H 20mm"

what does this all mean? I set it up last night and got a good look at the moon, but viewing stars/ planets etc is no better than with a naked eye. 

Are they any ways to increase its power? additional thingys or whatsits? 

Or would it be cheaper to just go out and buy a whole new telescope to get better viewing? 

thank you

<TEXT> They are not a pest at all. 

Edit: "More recently, consecutive reviews of the state of knowledge on the management of kangaroos
have failed to correlate kangaroo control to meaningful damage mitigation to pastoral properties or
the landscape in general (Olsen and Low; Olsen and Braysher; Herbert and Elzer)."

and

"[t]he main reason
an industry is approved is almost certainly because of the extent to which kangaroos are regarded as
a pest (Pople and Grigg). It is this construction of the kangaroo as a pest that has facilitated the
growth of the kangaroo industry, yet the view is based on ignorance, mistaken assumptions, and the
influence of vested interests in current practices."

<TEXT> I also pick, mostly when I am stressed/upset/angry etc. I used to have to put bandages around my finger tips because I would pick at the skin around them until it became too painful to use my fingers. 

Also, my cousin who also has ADHD used to pull out hairs one at a time, mostly her leg hair and eyelashes. she also picked at pimples a lot when she was a teen. 

I still do pick at my fingers from time to time, but I used to do it without even realising, I somehow became more conscious of it, and would be able to stop myself before I caused myself pain, just by focusing on what I was doing and asking myself what it was achieving, why was I doing it, should I keep doing it or should I stop. It doesnt sound like much but its helped. 

I have also read that having something to fidget with helps, although I haven't tried.  </TEXT>

Although, I do feel like these thoughts, as depressing as they can be, are not necessarily the result of depression.

I try to not have these thoughts as a negative thing, but rather as a positive. Use them to inspire me to work through the dullness of general life while planning on doing more exciting things later. Eg. having a boring job now will give me the money I need to travel later. 

I would love to move to the country (overseas maybe) and set up a self sustaining property to live on one day.

I'm currently an Australian learning German, are there any words that I might have this problem with? I'm finding German pronunciation to be quite difficult, particularly 'ch'  </TEXT>

<TEXT> of course, I wont think of them any differently if they have ASD :) I have worked with autistic (and other disabilities) children before, and adored them all. 
unfortunately, even with that experience, I struggle with the twins. My sister (their mother) told me yesterday that she had to wrap one twin in a blanket and hug him for a while to calm him down because he was trying to destroy the house... I think having to resort to things like that makes her question her parenting. 
we have tried time out, other calming techniques with them, but they don't really work. but i think preventing the tantrums with fun activities is the way to go. 

so I will check out r/autism, might find many more ideas and advice. good suggestion, thank you. 

I have been trying to figure out how to get bean bag supplies and make them before thursday (when i see them next), but maybe I will just get them to throw their teddies instead haha. might be an inside game... 

and thanks for talking, it really is helping, and making me feel a lot more positive about things </TEXT>

<TEXT> no official diagnosis, although Autism Spectrum has been mentioned. 
They are great kids, I feel bad watching them struggle when their other siblings are doing so well, watching their sister who is 2 years younger than them doing better in a lot of areas than they are is really heartbreaking, and they are at the age now where they are aware of this. It doesn't take much for them to lash out and turn violent from frustration. 
I really like the bean bag idea, it's so simple but seems like something they will enjoy, and I think I could even make the things myself, so that's this weeks project.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello and thank you!

Yes, they see a speech and physical therapist, so I think they cover a lot in their sessions, speech, enunciation, posture and eating/swallowing etc. 

Thanks for the suggestions, I'm heading off to google to do some research, they really seem like excellent ideas, and I truly appreciate it. 

I just worry about their development, and I know their parents do too, they also go to kindy one day a week which they are benefiting from, but I think more home activities will be really good for them. 

thanks again </TEXT>

<TITLE> Activities for very energetic 4 year old boys </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-30 07:01:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi parents,

I'm an aunty to four year old twin boys (and their 6 year old brother and 2 year old sister) 
I babysit them 1-4 days a week while their mother is studying. 

The twins have severe speech delay, they talk at about a 2yo level, although they are intellectually normal, their speech affects their behaviour I believe, they get frustrated very easily and it doesnt take them long to go from quietly playing nicely, to throwing bricks at each other. 

I have no idea how to entertain them, they wont sit still for long, they wont read books with me, they like to throw things, so its hard to play organised games with them, they don't really follow instructions very well. 
They spend most of their time digging in dirt in their backyard and playing with trucks or cars. 

Outside play is good for children, i know, but I feel like for their development they need a variety of activities but I'm just stuck for ideas. 

their parents also have no idea how to entertain them. 

thanks  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few years ago I was walking my two dogs,  ones a mix breed (monti) and the other a dalmatian (maisie) who was very intelligent and a lovely dog.  
Anyway,  as we were walking monti was a little further ahead of me and maisie, Maisie starts slowly creeping up on monti,  obviously planning to pounce on him. 
As she was getting closer, mont turned around to look at her and she instantly switched to a casual jog, looked away from monti and acted like nothing was going on.  As soon as monti looks away maisie starts her sneaking again.  
This repeated a few more times until maisie got close enough to jump on monti.  
It was hilarious to watch,  I think it really showed a sense of humour and planning beyond what dogs at usually given credit for.

And another:
My parents had two galahs (parrot), both unable to fly that lived in their backyard,  every morning (that I observed) they would sit up on the roof of their cage and watch the sunrise together. Like really just stare out at it and occasionally groom one another.  So romantic.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a lot of things that are or could be labeled as supernatural could potentially be just othernatural, the universe in infinite and if we consider the possibility of other dimensions, then it will likely be impossible for us to really know or theorise about everything that may exist. 
eg- ghosts, I don't really believe in ghosts as they are described in horror/ popular stories, but I can accept that the chance of them existing in some form is possible. 
We don't really understand conciousness as it is, it might be that our conciousness continues on in some form after we die. maybe then we find out what living in a 2D world is like or something. 

I think I am more supernatural agnostic rather than believe though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like having a colour one would give me the ability to paint like van Gogh...right? 
I associate colours with numbers,  but it is pretty mild and sometimes vague so it could basically not happen and I wouldn't notice.  

Are they boring personalities? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Grapheme-colour and Sound-motion
2. When I was young, 7-10 maybe, my sister gets some versions of synesthesia also, we were discussing once what colours various numbers were and our other sister didn't know what we were talking about as she doesn't have synesthesia, but it was a few years later in my teens when I learned about synesthesia.
4. It's sort of neutral, doesn't help or hinder most of the time. But the Sound-motion makes me dizzy sometimes and I would gladly do without it. 
5. I sometimes will choose things based on their number, or avoid them for the same reason. eg. I have an appointment for the 20th and not the 21st because 20 is a nicer colour (pastel purple/pink)  than 21 (brown/ green, kinda camo) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bad synesthesia. :( </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone, 
I'm just wondering if anyone else has a negative experience with synesthesia, as I mainly read about it as a positive thing. 

I have mild grapheme-colour synesthesia, which doesn't bother me at all, but I get sound-motion synesthesia really bad sometimes and it makes me feel really dizzy. 

basically, it just sucks, and with all fun forms of synesthesia, I get this one.

<TEXT> I've pretended to be religious, or at least pretend to not be atheist...which I guess is the same thing... in lesser situations. 
The thing with religious people is they fear losing something (eternal life or whatever) if they renounce their religion, so they would rather die than risk losing that. 
For me, there is no after life, there is only this life, why would I give that up?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> TIFU (a few years ago) when I went to do some shopping, a very frail looking old man came up to me and asked if I could help him with his suspenders-
One strap at the back had come undone.
Being the super helpful member of the community that I am,  I said 'of course!' and clipped the strap back into place.  
The old man turned to look at me with his gentle, sweet old man face,  held my hand and said 'thank you, dear', in his quiet and quivering voice, turned back around and walked off. 

Then I noticed I'd clipped the strap of his suspenders onto his underwear instead of his pants. 
Gave the poor man a wedgie. </TEXT>
