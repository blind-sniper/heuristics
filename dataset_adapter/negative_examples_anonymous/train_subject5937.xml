<TEXT> After winning 1,000,000, the payout was suspended when Ingram was accused of cheating by having his wife, Diana, and an accomplice, Tecwen Whittock, cough as Ingram announced the correct answer from the available choices. Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of "procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception".

The Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences suspended for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months, also suspended), each fined 15,000, and each ordered to pay 10,000 towards prosecution costs. The trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram 40,000 and Diana Ingram 25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay 115,000. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but they all have issues to resolve - hopefully peacefully. 

The Park-Xi summit in 2013 showed promise of warming relations, but this quickly chilled after China extended their Air Defense Identification Zone (East China Sea) over South Korean territory. Despite this, in July 2014, Xi visited South Korea before its traditional ally North Korea, and in their talks, both leaders affirmed their support for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations. Both leaders also expressed their concerns over Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe's reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution (armed forces with war potential will not be maintained). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Walker's record as governor of Wisconsin excites many Republicans. He's got a solid rsum as a small-government conservative. His social-conservative credentials are also strong, but without the culture-warrior baggage that sometimes brings. And Walker has won three difficult elections in a blue-ish state.

Rubio - Charles Krauthammer pegs him as the Republican frontrunner. His best hope seems to be to emerge as a consensus candidate who can appeal to social conservatives and hawks, and he's even sounded some libertarian notes of late. He's well-liked by Republicans, and has surged forward since announcing, but he needs to move up from second choice to first choice for more of them. Rubio seems to scare Democrats more than any other candidate, too.

Paul - He's relatively permissive on drugs, passionate about civil liberties, and adamantly in favor of restraint on foreign policy. But Paul has worked hard to firm up establishment ties since reaching the Senate, and he has recently worked to paper over his differences with GOPs hawkish wing, calling for a declaration of war against ISIS and generally saber-rattling. He is positioning himself as a candidate with crossover appeal in the general election.

 "The 2015 El Nio is likely to strengthen in the coming weeks, largely due to recent tropical cyclone activity. Several tropical cyclones, including a rare July cyclone in the southern hemisphere, have resulted in a strong reversal of trade winds near the equator. This is likely to increase temperatures below the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean, which may in turn raise sea surface temperatures further in the coming months."

<TEXT> On Thursday Draghi added his voice to calls for debt relief for Greece -- whose debts amount to 180 percent of economic output -- saying the main question at this stage was what form this relief should take.
Athens has already failed to make two key payments to the International Monetary Fund and its next debt deadline is a 4.2-billion-euro payment to the ECB itself on July 20, a deadline Draghi said he was sure would be met.
Speaking in Frankfurt, the ECB chief also said the conditions were "in place" to raise the ceiling on the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) available to Greek banks, despite questions about their solvency.
The ELA -- which has kept Greek banks, and by extension the economy, afloat -- has been fixed at around 89 billion euros since late June, but would be topped up with an additional 900 million euros, Draghi said. </TEXT>

During a brutal divorce - - my ex told my daughter very hateful lies about me - - awful things.

Ex also told my daughter that I was suicidal, and that it would be best if I just did it.

One day I have an argument with my daughter and she says "Why don't you just kill yourself!!?"

Recovering from that was one of the toughest things I've ever done. I never brought it up again, never threw it in her face, just moved on. 

I'll tell you, I was very depressed, and that nearly took me over the edge.

We have a history of lawyers that were able to get large judgments against "good samaritans" who tried to help, but did not provide the care that a trained medical professional would provide.

"Each player must generally pay tax in the state the income is earned. For example, if a Missouri resident plays a game in Wisconsin and receives game day pay, the player will owe income tax to Wisconsin on the earnings from that game  while all other income is not taxed in Wisconsin.

In addition to the earnings in each state, a taxpayer generally must pay tax to his state of residency. Most states subject an individual to a tax on worldwide income if he/she is a resident of such state. Although, the state may grant tax credits or deductions for taxes paid to other states." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prior to 1970, votes in Congress were anonymous (like citizens votes are) both in committees and on the floor. When legislation passed making all votes public, the transparency was seen as a great benefit to constituents. An unintended consequence is that it allowed lobbyists to track votes, and to directly tie donations to votes. In my opinion, this is why lobbying became so powerful in the late '70s and has controlled American politics ever since.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Goose pulling (also called gander pulling, goose riding or pulling the goose) was a blood sport practiced in parts of the Netherlands, Belgium, England and North America from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The sport involved fastening a live goose with a well-greased head to a rope or pole that was stretched across a road. A man riding on horseback at a full gallop would attempt to grab the bird by the neck in order to pull the head off."

"Goose pulling continues to this day as part of traditional Shrove Tuesday celebrations in Grevenbicht in the Netherlands and in parts of Belgium and Germany, **using a dead goose that has been humanely killed** by a veterinarian."

"If he is talking about the need for more full-time jobs than part time jobs, that's absolutely correct," Sanders said.

The flap came after Bush proposed increasing economic output by increasing worker participation, helping part-time workers get full-time work and helping Americans who have dropped out of the workforce find jobs. Democrats have tried to use the comments  Bush said growing the economy would require Americans to "work more hours"  to say he's "out of touch." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed - - Short story.

I was rear ended at highway speed resulting in severe pain but no permanent damage. I attended 2 chiropractors (first time in my life) that really helped me recover. The second one had me do these tests of "lift your hand against mine - oh, good pressure. Now with this bottle of nightshade essence placed against your shoulder, try to lift your hand. Oh wow you can't. See - - you have a problem with nightshade vegetables." (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers ... everything I love) "and I have some medicinals that can help."

ME: Like wow, interesting ... keep working on my back, and I'll look into that nightshade issue and get back to you (yah . . .  the fuck I will). 

Great chiropractor, but the homeopathy stuff is crap (additional source - family member in the "business" who married into it - - clearly cannot quote her. ) </TEXT>

On May 20, 2010, Tesla Motors and Toyota announced a partnership to work on electric vehicle development and collaborate on the "development of electric vehicles, parts, and production system and engineering support". This included Tesla's partial purchase of the former NUMMI site, mainly consisting of the factory building, for $42 million. 

Much of the 370-acre (150 ha) site is unused, with most activity concentrated in the 5,500,000-square-foot (510,000 m2) main building that does the final assembly of vehicles. </TEXT>

"*I come from a state where there is virtually no gun control. But the people of my state understand, pretty clearly, that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or Los Angeles. In our state, guns are used for hunting. In Chicago they are used for kids killing other kids or gang members shooting at police officers, shooting down innocent people. We need a sensible debate about gun control, which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this.*"

<TEXT> [Clear Eyes, Full Veins, Can't Lose](http://www.radiolab.org/story/308780-blood-banks/)

This is a radio program: "Peeking in on blood drives, wondering how blood gets from an arm to an operating table, producers Molly Webster and Soren Wheeler find a complex world that has them wondering if the gift of life isn't really a gift at all."

[THE BLOOD BROKERS - HOW BLOOD, THE 'GIFT OF LIFE,' BECAME A BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS](http://www.bloodbook.com/part-1.html)

Most blood sales take place through clearinghouses operated by the American Red Cross and other nonprofit blood-collecting groups. But there is also a spot market - not unlike the one for oil - where hundreds, possibly thousands, of sales occur each year.

"It functions rather like the NASDAQ," a national system for trading over-the-counter stocks, said Dr. Charles L. Rouault, president of the Broward Community Blood Center near Fort Lauderdale. "You pick up the phone and call somebody you know."

No one - not the federal government, not the blood banks themselves - knows for sure how much blood is bought and sold on the open market. There are no requirements that sales be reported; no government agency keeps track. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Off the top of my head, here are some basics of investing for retirement:

Tax sheltered retirements accounts vs "savings" account - Definitely use a tax sheltered account. These include IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc. That way your earnings grow for decades without being taxed each year.

Dollar cost averaging - simply means that you invest on a regular basis (e.g. weekly, monthly) at what ever the price is on that day. Don't worry about trying to time the market each time you money is invested. The tough decision is what to do when there is a large correction - I'm not even going to get into that now. The point is to invest for the long term.

Diversification - Mutual funds are a great way to go. There are many very good mutual funds that invest across a variety of sectors of the economy, and some funds are global so they invest in different countries as well. Just don't put all your savings into one, or a few stocks. While this can pay off well, it can also create large losses if one of your few stocks tank.

Compounding - I'm sure you are aware of the idea of compound growth (if not - look it up). To me, the most important part of the compounding story is how important it is to start investing NOW. Even if you're not sure what to invest in, just DO SOMETHING. You can look up charts showing how much more you will have at retirement if you simply start saving a few years earlier. So don't put it off.

Risk/reward - this is a tough one. Do your best to understand what you are investing in. If you don't understand an investment (e.g. annuities, REITs, futures, options, etc.) then either pick something else, or do your homework until you do understand it. You need to feel comfortable with the investments to be able to sleep well at night. Some investments are inherently more risky. This is not necessarily bad. Risk should mean greater potential for growth and loss. You need to be comfortable with the "level of risk" of each of your investments.

Financial Planners - I have never used one, but if you do, I recommend a fee-only FP. That means a FP that makes ZERO money off commissions from ANY of the investments. Fee only planners charge you an up-front fee (either a flat fee or a percent of what you have invested each year). That means they aren't compensated by the mutual fund company to steer you into one fund or another simply because they get a higher commission. Commissions can create conflicts of interest. So, I definitely see the value of a FP to help you make a plan, but only if they are fee only.

Wow, I didn't plan ow writing quite that much. Anyhoo . . . good luck, but more importantly, start ASAP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You asked "What is the best way to start planning for retirement".

I would suggest a different approach. Plans change, investments will vary, options depend on many factors.

I advise you both agree to a retirement **commitment**. 

Commit to a percent of your income that will be invested every month and every year for the rest of your lives - - together.

Commit that you will not touch that retirement nest egg EVER until retirement.

For example, if you hit hard times, before you dip into the retirement fund, downsize. Sell stuff. Change jobs. Take on a second job.

If you can commit that you will do this for each other, because you know that you want to provide for your "golden years" together, the rest - - the details - -  will follow.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Older movies seem to have an odd effect of becoming amazing once years go by

Really? . . . Perhaps history is truly dead. ... Awards and honors:

John Huston **won the Academy Award** for Directing and **Academy Award** for Writing Adapted Screenplay in 1948 for his work on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Walter Huston, John Huston's father, also **won the Academy Award** for Best Supporting Actor for his role in this film, the first father-son win. The film was **nominated for the Best Picture award**, but lost to Laurence Olivier's film adaptation of Hamlet.

In 1990, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "**culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The film was among the first 100 films to be selected**.

Director Stanley Kubrick listed The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as **his 4th favorite film of all time** in his list of his top ten favorite films in a 1963 edition of Cinema magazine. Director Sam Raimi ranked it as **his favorite film of all time** in an interview with Rotten Tomatoes and director Paul Thomas Anderson watched it at night before bed while writing his film There Will Be Blood.

American Film Institute recognition:

AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies  No. 30

AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills  No. 67

It has an IMDB rating of 8.3, and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 100%/critics   93%/audience. 

It is #34 on Rotten Tomatoes list of the [Top 100 movies of all time]( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/)

So yes, a paraphrased quote was used in a 40+ year old movie (Blazing Saddles). It was also used many, many other times.

<TEXT> The original version of the line appeared in B. Traven's novel The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1927):

- "All right," Curtin shouted back. "If you are the police, where are your badges? Let's see them."
- "Badges, to god-damned hell with badges! We have no badges. In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges, you god-damned cabrn and chinga tu madre!"

The line was popularized by John Huston's 1948 film adaptation of the novel, which was bowdlerized to meet Hays Code regulations severely limiting profanity in film. In one scene, a Mexican bandit leader named "Gold Hat" (portrayed by Alfonso Bedoya) tries to convince Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) that he and his company are Federales:

- Dobbs: "If you're the police, then where are your badges?"

- Gold Hat: "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!"

The phrase from the book chinga tu madre translates to "fuck your mother". </TEXT>

<TEXT> My daughter was home schooled by her mother (when we were still married) starting in 5th grade.. They both wanted it so I went along with it. The first year went well. 6th grade was a disaster. For 7th grade she transferred to the Stanford Online High School. That went a little better the first year, then things crashed and burned. There were no opportunities for socialization, and the program didn't even meet the UC system requirements. 

I worked hard, and finally got her into one of the best public high schools you could go to. She is so much happier there and finally doing great. 

Unless there is some compelling reason for home schooling, I can't recommend it.  </TEXT>

I said "lower your expectations". They were appalled thinking I was insulting the quality or worthiness of one of them.

9 therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 10unto the children of the east, [to go] against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. 11and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. 12Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 13 therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword. 14And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah. 15Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity; 16therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 17And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. </TEXT>

New International Version:
There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.

New Living Translation:
She lusted after lovers with genitals as large as a donkey's and emissions like those of a horse.

English Standard Version:
and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.

New American Standard Bible: 
"She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

King James Bible:
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

Holman Christian Standard Bible:
and lusted after their lovers, whose sexual members were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions. 

International Standard Version:
She lusted after her paramours, whose genitals are like those of donkeys, and whose emissions are like those of horses. 

NET Bible:
She lusted after their genitals--as large as those of donkeys, and their seminal emission was as strong as that of stallions.

GOD'S WORD Translation:
She lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose semen was like that of horses.

Jubilee Bible 2000:
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

King James 2000 Bible:
For she doted upon her paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.**" Now... I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, that meant your ass. You'd be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. See, now I'm thinking: maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here... he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. And I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin', Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Neuroscientists believe REM sleep serves different roles in newborns and infants: It allows their brains to build pathways, become integrated and, later, helps them develop language. (Similarly, juvenile birds learn songs during REM sleep.) While all that grunt work is going on, they lack the head space and the ability to imagine themselves as the heroes of baby adventures, or to dream up fantasy toys.

Dreaming, neuroscientists think, is a cognitive process that arises in early childhood, once babies have acquired the capacity to imagine things visually and spatially. Babies do have experiences, before and after they are born. I would imagine that, primaily, [this is what babies dream about.](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2227/2752605590_e50c3a9923_z.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope you take this in the spirit it is meant. While my ex was the one that was very disrespectful within our relationship (see my other post in this thread) I had difficulties with her beliefs as well.

To sum it up, the majority of Christians have a belief in an afterlife that is conditional on your behavior (yes, I've really oversimplified, but please go with me on this). 

It can be very difficult to see the person you love most as being on a path that does not lead to the afterlife that you believe in. So, while a Christian may initially say they are OK with you being an atheist, be aware - - belief is a powerful force, and as time goes on, it can really mess with how one sees their partner.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a direct answer, but here's some more Reddit related info from [The Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/reddit-moderators-shut-down-parts-of-site-over-employees-dismissal/)

Reddit sells large, targeted advertising campaigns that run at the top of individual subreddits.

The events come at a particularly inauspicious time for Reddit, which only a week ago celebrated its 10th anniversary. Last year, Reddit raised $50 million in venture capital and planned to use the money for hiring and refining the advertising business.

The site has been valued at roughly $250 million, according to a recent disclosure by its lawyers. Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond Nast, still owns a majority of the company and retains a board seat.

The company has had its problems during the past year. Yishan Wong abruptly resigned in November as Reddits chief executive after a dispute with the companys board of directors.

Reddit has also taken steps to combat harassment on and off its site, moves that many members of the community complain have stifled the principles of free speech upon which the site was founded.

There has also been tension between factions of the Reddit community and Ellen Pao, the companys interim chief executive, whom many Reddit users blame for imposing the anti-harassment policies. An online petition asking Pao to step down has garnered more than 13,000 signatures.

Reddit users have also questioned Paos ability to lead the company while dealing with major issues in her personal life. For nearly two years, Pao was embroiled in a well-publicized discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers, the venture-capital firm. Pao lost that case in March. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. I looked it up myself, and the length of time between sunsets does vary significantly throughout the year. This is *so* not intuitive to me. 

But the times I get are different than yours (I might be doing the math wrong). I get 2 hours 23 min today, and 2 hours 56 min. at Christmas. 

I think this is correct since the Earth is about 24,000 miles around, so you'd need to travel about 1000 mph (at equator) to keep up with the sun. Less at relevant latitudes.

Did his victim get any of those? 

Edit - not sure why the downvotes. This guy placed an order for delivery, demanded money, hit her in the head with a baseball bat, then placed her in a trash bin.

I don't feel he gets the right to a "last" anything. If you disagree, please explain.  </TEXT>

"They're *sending* people that have lots of problems"

"They're rapists."

Do you seriously not have any issues with this?

<TEXT> Story time. When I was a kid I was given a really nice mechanical pencil. I loved it, and used it in school all the time. As I'm sure many of you can relate, assignments were just a bit more enjoyable when using an instrument of beauty. So one day it gets stolen, and it really bummed me out. I kept an eye out, and sure enough I eventually see a kid in another class using my pencil. I confront him and he says it's his. I give him one last chance, and he digs in.

So by now the teacher has come over because I'm pretty pissed off. He still claims it's his. So I ask the teacher to remove the eraser and take out the paper underneath it. It reads "This belongs to train_subject5937". 

Busted! </TEXT>

 Isn't this the same rationale against the downvoting? (There is indiscriminate downvoting to otherwise appropriate content).

<TEXT>  Another problem a downvote bot causes it it discourages people from posting, and it makes the subreddit feel way more hostile to a new user. Even if it doesn't modify the placement on the 'new' page, it kills me to see posts at 0 or -1 points when they don't deserve it.

 I understand this sentiment, but it is overcome so quickly by other users upvoting it (if it is appropriate content).
 Both sides have good points and overall I am just concerned about any form of potential "censorship." I am kind of in a if its not too broke lets not fix it mentality in regards to the downvotes.

Quote much bro? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I have a great interaction as a customer, I make sure I get their name, and then . . . 

- As I walk to my car I use Maps.Google.com to get the store/restaurant phone #

- I immediately call on speaker phone so I can do it NOW while I'm driving and it costs me no time

- I ask to speak to the Mgr, and say "Hey, you need to know what just happened with one of your employees . . ."

- As they brace for yet another complaint, I hit them with how fantastic Jane was (and why), and it's people like this that make me a loyal customer.

I guarantee: you, the manager, and the employee will all have a better day because you took the time. 

Edit: I thought about it, and I agree that an email, if you really will take the time, is even better since it creates a permanent record. I will now do both. </TEXT>

Do you really think any country is going to invade NK? And if they did, that NK wouldn't detonate nuclear bombs before facing defeat? In reality it wouldn't get that far since China would step in immediately. 

Covert ops? You don't think that was tried as NK was developing their nuclear program? It was. It failed.

"Peaceful ..." NK is still at war. There is no "peace" yet, and they have NO interest in pursuing peace. So, good luck there.

And, to be clear, Jang Jin-sung said the internal solution is "the forces of the market", not an overthrow of the government. 

I have no solutions other than shaming China into either owning the problem, or getting out of the way of others that want to "influence" the situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jang Jin-sung says stop funding food aid:

North Korean exiles will tell you that the international community must stop funding food aid. We say this not out of spite with regard to a nation whose leadership invests in luxuries, nuclear tests and missile launches while the welfare of its subjects remains low among its priorities. We say this for pragmatic and humanitarian reasons, because the assumptions that lie behind funding food aid have hindered economic reform in our homeland, not helped it.

Today, the fatal threat for the regime lies not in the outside world, but within the country itself. More specifically, this is the jangmadang  an underground economy arisen from the ashes of economic collapse in the 1990s, and which consist of market activities taking place beyond the remit of the regimes control mechanisms.

In todays North Korea there are two rival forces in battle: the forces of the regime and the forces of the market. The formers interests are better served by the maintenance of existing party, military and surveillance mechanisms of control. The latter are equivalent to North Koreas progressives, who believe in a future that is possible beyond the absolute, stifling and structurally inhumane confines of the regime.

An international community wishing to assist the North Korean people should recognise that funding food aid is a channel of limited efficiency. The majority of North Koreans depend not on the regimes munificence but on market forces  they have already found this a more successful alternative, despite a disproportionate lack of international support or awareness.

Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-ils favourite state poets until he defected in 2004. He founded the North Korea news website New Focus International </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for putting this out there. Schwarzenegger is an ass. Very successful, but still an a-hole. 

Judge Lloyd Connelly called Schwarzenegger's decision to reduce Esteban Nunez's sentence from 16 years to seven years distasteful and "repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state," but within his executive powers as governor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is such bullshit! Another blow to freedom.

Judge Michael Mosman of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled late on Monday that the Second Circuit was wrong and that the program could resume.

"Second Circuit rulings are not binding on the F.I.S.C. and this court respectfully disagrees with that courts analysis, especially in view of the intervening enactment of the U.S.A. Freedom Act," he wrote. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sounds were accompanied by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors, and did not report seeing the explosion. The explosion registered at seismic stations across Eurasia. It is estimated that, in some places, the resulting shock wave was equivalent to an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale. It also produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in Great Britain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS is [*The Trans-Pacific Partnership clause everyone should oppose*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html) (By Elizabeth Warren February 25)

ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws  and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers  without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court. Heres how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators. If the company won, the ruling couldnt be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions  and even billions  of dollars in damages. </TEXT>

Perillos of Athens invented and proposed it to Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas, Sicily, as a new means of executing criminals. The bull was made entirely of bronze, hollow, with a door in one side. The bull was in the form and size of an actual bull and had an acoustic apparatus that converted screams into the sound of a bull. The condemned were locked in the device, and a fire was set under it, heating the metal until the person inside roasted to death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a large difference between what the general American population wants, and what our "representatives" do. Research shows that popular opposition to (or support for) a policy has a small effect in a majority  of cases. However, support/opposition from a much smaller constituency of "influential" entities has significant effect. This small minority of wealthy contributors, (individual, corporate, PACs, etc.) and lobbyists has a much greater impact on US policy. 

TLDR: What a majority of Americans want is much less influential on enacted policy than what donors and lobbyists demand.  </TEXT>

PS - The earliest predecessor of the game of chess probably originated in India, before the 6th century AD; a minority of historians believe the game originated in China. From India, the game spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe.

They did invent the first human civilization, and the first empire in the world, the Persian Empire. </TEXT>

There is no physical proof that math actually exists. 

Edit 1 - After several downvotes I have seen no response with an argument as to why we should see math as a given feature of the universe rather than simply a human creation. The downvotes without responses make me more convinced that I am correct. If I could come up with a counter argument, I would.

Re transsexuals - great answer.

Re race - it is not entirely cosmetic. It is largely cultural. While the racial experience is not even close to universal, there are cultural aspects that are generally ingrained in how one relates to ones race.

<TEXT> Legal experts said they're often surprised that people who comment online, even younger Internet users who've grown up online, seem to believe they're protected.

"In my experience with speaking with groups, and even speaking with some students, they seem to believe they will be protected when they speak on the Internet because they choose to use some fictitious name," Tulane University law professor Amy Gajda said.

Illinois' opinion was based in large part on a pair of earlier, lower-court decisions in the state, which held that the anonymity of someone who makes comments in response to online news stories isn't guaranteed if their opinions are potentially defamatory, according to Don Craven, an attorney for the Illinois Press Association.

"It's not that you get to say whatever the heck you want to say and you're going remain anonymous," Craven said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Close, but not quite. If it's 2 turns on and 2 turns off it's for a 3-way lamp.

A 3-way lamp, also known as a tri-light, is a lamp that uses a 3-way light bulb to produce three levels of light in a low-medium-high configuration. A 3-way lamp requires a 3-way bulb and socket, and a 3-way switch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In America there is a history of various terms that have been used such as negro, black, Afro-american, African-american, colored, etc. Each has been "in favor" at various times, and each has had its difficulties. As an example the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) still goes by NAACP even though "colored" is rarely used any more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No - that is the definition of mass murder, not mass shooting.

For example, "in 2012, Travis Steed and others shot 18 people total. Miraculously, he only killed one. Under the incorrect definition of mass shooting, that event would not be considered a mass shooting! Arguing that 18 people shot during one event is not a mass shooting is absurd." </TEXT>

Five people were injured after being shot on a party bus traveling down Interstate 240 early New Year's Day.

The party bus drove to the Baptist East emergency room with five victims. **Two people were in extremely critical condition**.

<TEXT> After reading this list, THAT was your reaction?

NO, many bullets hitting someone are:

Suicides

A child accidentally shooting a sibling, parent or friend

A gun owner surprised by a spouse, housemate or family member coming home

And many, many other single victim shootings.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ian Bremmers book "Three Choices for America's Role in the World" lays out these options:

**Independent America** argues that its time for Washington to declare independence from the responsibility to solve everyone elses problems. Instead, America should lead by example by investing in Americas enormous untapped potential.

**Moneyball America**  acknowledges that we cant manage every international challenge but asserts that we must defend U.S. interests wherever theyre threatened. Like the Oakland As general manager Billy Beane spending scarce capital only where it offered the most promising return.
 
**Indispensable America** insists that only Washington can promote the values on which global stability increasingly depends in our hyper-connected world. Turning inward would threaten Americas security and prosperity. </TEXT>

I don't have a problem with zero tolerance, as long as the punishment fits the crime. 

I do have a problem with punishing all violations in the same way.

This prank should not be tolerated (zero tolerance) but it should have a punishment that fits the crime, such as time spent contributing back to the school.

TLDR: **Zero Tolerance** can work if **The Punishment Fits The Crime**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "This study seeks to look beyond the use of radiation pressure for thrust, and to explore a means of solar navigation whereby a solar craft would be steered by use of radiation pressure. The idea is based on a recent discovery by the study team. They found that transparent refractive objects may settle into a position where they feel a force that is perpendicular to the incoming light direction. This transverse force is akin to the lift experience by an airplane wing and other airfoils. Thus they call it optical lift. Objects in their experiments simultaneously thrust forward. The combination of lift and thrust allows for the optical steering of optical wings. In the coming year they will conduct experiments and computer modeling to advance this discovery for future space missions employing solar sails. The long-term goal is to devise a means to allow solar sails to navigate through space using only the power of sunlight. In the short term they will design and fabricate small-scale arrays of optical wings and test them in the laboratory to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. They will also perform numerical modeling to determine optimal design parameters for optical wings."

<TEXT> This study had several limitations. 

First, we did not have adequate numbers to examine suicide trends in some specific subgroups 

Second, changes in cause of death coding might have affected our findings, 

Third, the study was not designed to determine whether changes in suicide rates in black and white children corresponded to periods of change in risk factors for suicide. 

Fourth, it is **unknown whether the accuracy of classification of a death as suicide in children has changed during the study** </TEXT>

<TEXT> The purpose of the student loan is to provide future benefit (the fruits of the education). Since the ex-spouse will not be able to participate in the future benefit, both statues and court rulings state that, in general, student loans within a marriage are individual debts, not joint debts. There are exceptions, but that is the rule.

Example: If my wife puts me through medical school with $250,000 in student loans, then after 6 years of marriage I divorce her, she does NOT have to pay any of the loans since they will only benefit me - - via future income. </TEXT>

1. Clearly a search could be evidence in support of criminal charges (e.g. "how to dissolve a body with lye")

2. Under the Patriot Act, repeated searches on the President's travel plans, combined with searches to hire an assassin, etc. might be prosecutable.  

Other than the Patriot Act or threats on the President, I have a hard time seeing when a search, or even a pattern of searches would be a crime. </TEXT>

 75% percent were Christian. 

 64% say they pray more than once a day.

 56% say they most often pray for family members, with 3.3% saying that they pray for strangers.

 A little over 38% say that the most important purpose of prayer is intimacy with God.

 41% say that their prayers are answered often.

 1.5% say that their prayers are never answered.

 Over 73% say when their prayers are not answered, the most important reason is because they did not fit Gods plan.

 5% say that they pray most often in a house of worship.

 79% say that they pray most often at home.

 67% say that in the past six months, their prayers have related to continually giving thanks to God. (Pastors Weekly Briefing, 12/24/04)

<TEXT> A recent study showed that it is natural for nostrils to have differing air intake volumes under normal conditions. The findings suggest this aids in identification of scents, as the reactions occur differently at a higher volume and an lower volume.

Edit: [Nature.com Article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6757/full/402035a0.html)

"The flow of air is greater into one nostril than into the other because there is a slight turbinate swelling in one. The nostril that takes in more air switches from the left to the right one and back again every few hours, but the effect of this switching on the sense of smell has been unclear. Here we show that this difference in airflow between the nostrils causes each nostril to be optimally sensitized to different odorants, so that each nostril conveys a slightly different olfactory image to the brain." </TEXT>

It replaced the pro-Union governor, Sam Houston, in the process. During the war, slavery in Texas was little affected, and prices for slaves remained high until the last few months of the war. The number of slaves in the state increased dramatically as the Union Army occupied parts of Arkansas and Louisiana. Slaveholders in those areas often moved their slaves to Texas to avoid having them emancipated. By 1865 there were an estimated 250,000 slaves in Texas." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kenebrew is represented by civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod, who last year represented Robert Bryant of Kelso, Tennessee.

Sherrod argued that Madison County deputies in the summer of 2012 conspired to stalk, beat and falsely arrest Bryant. Bryant sued Sheriff Dorning and eight deputies, including Countess, in federal court last year.

The county settled with Bryant for $625,000 last year and the FBI then announced it was investigating the deputies.

This lawsuit invokes the Bryant case and related newspaper articles to argue that Dorning and the Madison County Sheriff's Department have a record of ignoring or even covering up police misconduct.

"Deputies under [Sheriff] Dorning's command have learned that their justifications for using force and other unlawful actions will never be questioned," reads the Kenebrew suit, "and that they can act with impunity." </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are 10 of these disturbing fairy tales in the article.

**Sleeping Beauty** - In one of the very earliest versions of this classic story, published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile as Sun, Moon, and Talia, the princess does not prick her finger on a spindle, but rather gets a sliver of flax stuck under her fingernail. She falls down, apparently dead, but her father cannot face the idea of losing her, so he lays her body on a bed in one of his estates. Later, a king out hunting in the woods finds her, and since he cant wake her up, rapes her while shes unconscious, then heads home to his own country. Some time after that, still unconscious, she gives birth to two children, and one of them accidentally sucks the splinter out of her finger, so she wakes up. The king who raped her is already married, but he burns his wife alive so he and Talia can be together. Dont worry, the wife tries to kill and eat the babies first, so its all morally sound. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  according to the CDC 86 cases of measles were reported in the year 2000. ... The whole measles thing by itself is a joke and not a real threat to America.

[From January 1 to January 30, 2015, 102 people from 14 states were reported to have measles](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)
"The United States experienced a record number of measles cases **during 2014, with 644 cases from 27 states reported to CDC**'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000."

* The majority of the people who got measles were unvaccinated.
* Measles is still common in many parts of the world including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.
* Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the U.S.
* Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.

**Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.)** said individuals who come to the U.S. illegally may be responsible for the recent measles outbreak, contending they dont undergo the stringent health screening others do when they enter the country. I dont think there is any health care professional who has examined the facts who could honestly say that Americans have not died because the disease is brought into America by illegal aliens who are not properly health care screened as lawful immigrants are.

**Rush Limbaugh** - The children coming across the southern U.S. border "were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy."

Grab hold of the feces with the shells and pull them out. Continue until all large bits have been removed.

Use shell 3 to scrape (be gentle!) and remove anything you might have missed.

Wash (or flush) the shells, wash your bottom with warm water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since I made the above post, I read other posts and analysis.

The "Memorandum" is not a treaty - it is an agreement.

In the case of aggression, the remedy "if Ukraine should become a victim of *an act of aggression* or *an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used*" is to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine.

Morally I believe the U.S. made a commitment that it needs to keep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances" is a diplomatic memorandum signed in December 1994 by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom under which signatories made promises to each other as part of the denuclearization of former Soviet republics after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Ukraine promised to remove all nuclear weapons, and kept this promise.

In return, Russia and the Western signatory countries essentially consecrated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as an independent state. In the "Budapest Memorandum," Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. They also pledged that none of them would ever use economic coercion to subordinate Ukraine to their own interest. They also pledged to protect Ukraine if its security was threatened.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When post-Cold War Ukraine gained independence, it held the worlds third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Rather than use nukes for protection, Ukraine sought and received assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected if it gave up its nuclear weapons. In 1994, the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which **all sides pledged to respect Ukraines territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or economic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty and provide assistance to Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from another nation**.

Obviously, Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the question is whether the US will break theirs.

**If the U.S. breaks their word, they should consider the devastating impact on American counter proliferation efforts around the world**. How could any nation ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see, in the carnage and destruction in Ukraine, **the deadly folly of trading nuclear weapons for American guarantees**? </TEXT>

After being unable to save two hostages held by Middle Eastern extremists, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said constitutional change will be needed to protect the lives and assets of Japanese citizens.

Abe has said at times that with the current interpretation of Article 9, which forbids both the use of force to settle international disputes and the maintenance of regular armed forces, it is difficult to protect Japanese citizens in a changing security environment.

The Liberal Democratic Party has already presented a draft amendment to Article 9, and amending it is to carry out our duty of protecting the lives and assets of Japanese citizens, Abe told the Upper House Budget Committee on Tuesday. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Right to Be Forgotten What search results for your name would you want erased? [Serious] </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A top EU court ruled Google must amend some search results at the request of ordinary people as a "**right to be forgotten**", saying links to "irrelevant" and outdated data should be **erased on request**.

- In 2012, the European Commission published plans for a "right to be forgotten" law, allowing people to request that data about themselves to be deleted

- Online service providers would have to comply unless they had "legitimate" reason to do otherwise

- The plans are part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the commission's 1995 Data Protection Directive

While this does not apply outside the EU  what would *any* of you want erased? </TEXT>
