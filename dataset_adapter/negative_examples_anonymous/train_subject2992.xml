<TEXT> Her influence and rule are two different things. She has direct physical rule over all of Slaver's Bay as of Season 5, that includes Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen. However her influence actually spreads further than that. There is a scene in the latest episode where a group of people pray for her in Volantis, which is much further west. It would be hard to calculate, however I'd say she actually has influence over a large portion of Essos. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Build Help] Question about graphic drivers when upgrading graphics card. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm upgrading from an MSI GTX 670 to an MSI GTX 970 4GB, my question is that do I need to uninstall and reinstall my graphics driver for this? The issue is that when I check Nvidia's website, the graphics driver for my current GTX 670 is exactly the same as the GTX 970 I'm upgrading to?

Check the supported products section here: http://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/80943/en-uk </TEXT>

<TEXT> A word of warning if you purchase those GTX 970s from Amazon UK, don't do it. Take a look at the graph at the bottom of their page, the price is going up and down too often for my liking. I'm presuming however you're going to be buying them from Ebuyer anyway, but just in case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She probably is still pregnant, in the last scene in the cafe she was about to tell the Doctor something before the conversation turned to Gallifrey. Besides, Orson Pink still needs to be born in the future with Danny and Clara as his ancestors. I'm surprised it wasn't revealed in this episode though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After watching the preview of this episode, here is what I think will happen:
Clara is pregnant, that is what she was calling to tell Danny before he died. Danny is going to die in this episode and be converted into a Cyberman. When converted into a Cyberman, something will happen that causes him to retain emotions and memories of Clara, they will then discuss Clara's pregnancy and have a heartfelt goodbye.
Clara's baby will then be the ancestor of Orson Pink. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even though xxPielsTastyxX is correct, the flight time of the entire mission would of only been about a minute long. I attempted launching a large platform craft, however it ran out of fuel as I was hovering over the ocean. Parachutes were then engaged and somehow a big piece of platform and an escape pod survived. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty solid episode. Didn't really get boring, good/funny writing, introduced a new companion (I like that they're copying Amy and Rory with Clara and Danny), big advancement on the Promised Land mystery in the last scene. Best episode of the series so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Night King was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. There were 12 White Walkers in the background in this scene, making the one that approached the baby; the 13th. This doesn't necessarily mean anything, however it could be symbolic.   </TEXT>
