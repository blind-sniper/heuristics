<TITLE> My ex was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago and is now suffering from depression. She does not have anybody and I am trying to learn how to effectively support her. I would really appreciate some advice. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I will try to keep it short:

We started dating in Jan 2013, she was diagnosed in August 2013 (she cannot be cured, but it is currently under control. Nobody knows for how long though). 
We stayed together until April this year. We had lots of ups and downs. However until now she always managed to pick herself back up. 

I don't want to go into why we broke up because my version of the story is of course biased. In any case, we did not work. By the end of our relationship we argued 24/7. 

She decided that she does not want to talk to me anymore. I did not like that but had to respect her wish. Yesterday she called me and was saying that she can't bear it anymore (the pressure, the emotional pain, being alone). The few friends she has do listen to her, but there is no solution to ease the emotional pain she is in. She keeps saying things that make me believe she might be about to harm herself. Also she has no family she can rely on. 

I want to help her, but I must know what the best way is to deal with depression. How can I make life seem worth living to her? 

Any advice on how to support her would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I firmly believe that the concept of duty is bullshit. 

Why does a soldier have to feel a sense of duty? It is a job. He is risking his life so pay him a lot. Don't tell him: Hey look, we can't pay you very well, but it's an honour to fight for your country, so you've got that going for you."

If a worker is supposed to work better, more efficient, etc, increase his compensation. What is wrong with that?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't believe water desalination is still difficult (or expensive). Of course I know nothing about it, but here is what I think:

In places where water is scarce, it's normally hot, so boiling water does not require soooooo much energy. I am sure you can build a few of them plants for a few million Dollars and build pipelines.

Who's gonna pay for it? Just ask some rich dudes if they want to be loved by a whole continent for 20% of their money. If I had the money, I would totally give.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I went through the following procedure because I did it all as it happened. I am sure by now you can skip half the steps

1. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-0-1-5-77-generic-t3012378

2. Flashed the first available Lollipop rom as soon as it was available pre rooted. I had to reinstall custom recovery though.

3. then I flashed this: http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/d5803-lollipop-5-02-odexed-pre-rooted-2-t3090505. When you do this, make sure to flash the dualrecovery after flashing the rom. Otherwise you lose the custom recovery again. 

I am sure this is nowhere near a good enough step by step guide. But you can find everything you need on XDA.

Edit: This is a good guide. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/general/how-to-root-backup-drm-keys-t3013343

Again, something easier might be available by now.

So far everything is perfect. Xposed works, I've got viper4android working. I'm super happy. 

Well actually I've got two problems:

1. Sometimes apps just force stop. But it's rare and really doesn't bother me. 

2. Very often the screen turns on in my pocket and changes settings, pocketdials, or does something else. But that is not a lollipop issue. That is a it's too hot and me legs are sweaty issue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A Stargate address is a coordinate system used by a Stargate to determine the position of a target gate in the Stargate Network. They are composed of a series of glyphs, at least seven depending on the intended destination, which when entered in the correct order allow the Stargate to establish a wormhole with another gate at the destination.

He was fucked in the head. He never got over the hunger he experienced in prison so he would never share food and he would always have tons of food in the freezer. He didn't sleep well and never talked about it. He beat his wife and children. 

He received a pension but that is it. No mental support, no therapy. Nobody thanked him or was proud of him. Nobody gave a shit basically. And to this day when people talk about him, nobody gives a shit that he was sent to fight </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here are the translated lyrics

[Part 1]

My biceps shall burn

Instead of always running away from me

I want to aim at the target

And since then I am only working out

***[Hook]***

This is a current trend

Even more than the Advent

This is THE event

My biceps burns

I am a workout talent

doing the experiment

permanently

My biceps burns

***[Part 2]***

I had almost given up

I was thinking

Throw what I carry with me (makes no sense)

All gone, the baggage, the Sixpack

<TEXT> **[Part 1]**

My biceps shall burn

Instead of always running away from me

I want to aim at the target

And since then I am only working out


**[Hook]**

This is a  current trend

Even more than the Advent

This is THE event

My biceps burns

I am a workout talent

doing the experiment

permanently

My biceps burns

**[Part 2]**

I had almost given up

I was thinking

Throw what I carry with me (makes no sense)

All gone, the baggage, the Sixpack

I'm always pumping

My mama already thought

I had gone to the brothel with Armin


**[Hook]**

**[Outro]**

<TEXT> Fair enough. I get your point and I don't think you are wrong. I understand that many people rely on artists like Swift to make a living. I also have no numbers that show Apple provides more welfare than Swift's label. 

I simply think that (even though I really dislike Apple) if Apple manages to provide a service that many people will use (iOS and Android) that will further limit piracy and will be providing better/similar performance and user experience that current offers (like Spotify) provide and if to do that and to penetrate the marker they regard it as necessary to offer 3 months free trial, then Swift should stop complaining that she is not getting paid for 3 months.

<TEXT> What I mean is she said artists don't get paid. There is no information about whether or not the labels won't make any money. It actually says that the labels expect a positive long term effect. The people are not employed by swift, but by the label. So her not getting the money should be acceptable if the apple secures jobs and the labels expect it to pay off in the long run. 

I hope this is understandable. I can't put it any better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only thing the bothers me about what she is saying is this:

 Swift hints that Apple can easily afford to eat the costs of paying out to labels during that period

Yes, they can, but so can she. The only difference is that Apple is a company that provides jobs for many people and therefore I'd rather they have the money and pay their people well. 

I don't think there is any problem with Taylor not getting the money for three month. This is not even considering that if she does not put her music on there, she also doesn't get any money.

<TEXT> I totally get where your question is going. 

All the answers make sense and try to show you a way to get out of an awkward situation. 

However I would like to recommend something else. 

If somebody has a certain budget and wants to spend that, that's fine. To that person it won't matter if they can get the same quality (considering their level of skill) as with one that is below their budget. So if you actually have the knowledge, recommend a camera that is good and is within their budget. Who are you to say that their pictures will turn out like shit and they don't have the potential to actually make use of the camera.

Now the important part is manage expectations. Try before buy is the motto. Who buys an expensive camera before taking it for a spin? If you have the time, let them take a few pictures with your camera. They'll see what they look like. If you don't have the time, tell them to ask in the store. Of course you should tell them why they should try the camera first and see what pictures they end up with. 

But you shouldn't feel bad and it should not be an awkward situation. If you recommend something and they are too lazy to try it first: their fault. They don't have to follow your advice. 

And for the guy who complained after: why don't you show him the kind of picture you can take with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I had the same problem. 

I bought a cable though, no adapter. 

I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EI41K26?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) cable and had the exact same problem. Would not detect the cable and I did not see anything. The cable has many good reviews so I guess I just got unlucky. 

Then I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00965EMF4?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01) and I am super happy with it. 

What I am trying to say is: Maybe your surface is faulty or settings need to be changed. But chances are you got a shitty adapter. I tried a different cable and that worked for me.

<TITLE> Stargate SG1: Jack needs a son and Daniel a dad. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-09 13:11:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Jack never got over the death of his son. Partly because he feels responsible for it but partly because he would like to be a dad. He is the perfect role model. He is aware of it because that is who he wants to be.

Daniel lost his parents when he was young and never got to learn from of look up to a male role model. He is a bit of a girl and he is also clumsy. 

When Jack meets Daniel, he sees a child - a kind but naive person. But he likes him

Daniel sees a military leader who does not care about morals or "the right thing to do". He does not understand Jack, just like a child does not understand grown ups. 

Over time they grow fond of each other and without ever realising it Jack becomes a father figure to Daniel and Daniel becomes a replacement for Jack's dead son. Daniel inspires Jack and turns him from being the cold soldier that he was into the best human being ever. 

Daniel on the other side only lives up to his full potential because of Jack. Daniel never realises that Jack always agrees with his morals. Jack often seems to be against Daniel's ideas. The reason is that Jack is able to see if something is a lost cause and instead of demoralising Daniel he takes the blame for not doing the morally right thing so that Daniel can stay who he is, just like a good father would. 

Jack protects Daniel like his own son. He wants him to grow, learn and eventually grow stronger and wiser than Jack himself. He is proud of Daniel and only like this is he able to sometimes forget that his actual son is dead. He gets to be a dad. 

Daniel, until very late, does not realise what an influence Jack has on him. He does not understand his motives and does not see that without Jack, he would have never been able to achieve what he achieved. He is always stubborn towards Jack because, just like a father, Jack is always in charge. However in the end you can feel Daniel's appreciation for Jack. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-06-07 02:22:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I will mostly be using it for Lightroom and internet surfing.  

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I will be playing Diablo 3 and some older games. I am considering to buy a new shooter though. Is that going to be possible? 1080 is fine for me.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I want to see if I can get this done with less than 300 quid. It is more of a project. I don't actually need a new PC. My laptop can just about handle Diablo 3. But I would really like to build my first own PC. 

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

UK

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

All I know is it will be with the Intel Xeon X5650 because I got that from a guy who got it from work. I already bought it with the intention of building a PC. 

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

The most important thing is that it will last me a few years. 

Many thanks in advance.

How would he know? The Avengers are the only ones who talked to Ultron, and I am pretty sure Fury can't just search the net for Ultron's plans. 

Also, I am not entirely sure but at that point I find it still 100% believable that Ultron only wants to eliminate the Avengers to protect earth. So why does Fury say he wants to kill everybody? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know. I count at least 20 people. Let's see:

If half of them want it warm, thats 30 seconds just for that plus let's say another 30 seconds for being served = 10 minutes

Let's say the other 10 people get served and pay cash in the time the other 10 get their sandwich heated up = +0 minutes.

I am sure at least 5 of them will have a coffee as well. I am sure this adds at least 5 minutes. 

I'll say it takes at least 15 minutes.

<TEXT> It is true what you say. Child molestation is never funny. But why do you think that he thinks it is funny? He's telling a story about how the 70s were different and how even child molesters were kind of accepted back then. And he makes a joke about that to point out how outrageous that actually is. 

Then he point out how absolutely insane these people are by stating that their desire for "a young boy" is stronger than their desire for freedom and general acceptance in society. He tells us that they are sick but he does it with jokes. 

I see nothing wrong with this. 

Edit: I didn't get that op was being sarcastic. Sorry...  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mortgages and the consequences of rising interest rates and decreasing real estate value. I think it's important to be aware of the possible implications. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-07 10:35:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am considering to buy (in Germany) and talked to my friend to get some advice. He told me that I should consider two points when deciding to get a mortgage:

**1. Rising Interest Rates**

This is obvious for everybody and all you guys probably know this. When you take out a mortgage you not only have to calculate if you are able to shoulder the monthly payments now, but you also have to calculate if you will be able to if interest rates rise to a certain level as soon as your interest rate changes. In Germany interest rates are normally fixed for 10 years. After that the interest rate WILL change according to the level they are at then. So you will have to try and anticipate a worst case scenario and find out if you can still pay your mortgage. Again, this is basic stuff and if you do not take this into consideration yet, you really should.

**2. If house prices drop**

Even though people on this sub might be mindful about point 1, a lot of people in the real world are not. They are (and have been) taking out mortgages for the past years because interest rates are so low. And that is fair enough. However as soon as interest rates will go up (and they will at some point) many of those people might not be able to afford their mortgage anymore and will be forced to sell. Personally I think that many people take out mortgages that are on the limit of what they can afford (because they want the nicest house they can get). As a consequence many people will be forced to sell when interest rates go up. This might lead to a decrease in real estate values because the market will be flooded with property. See Detroit. This will then mean that your security with the bank (your house) loses value and the bank will increase the mortgage repayments because of the increased risk. This might then lead to further house sales and boom! Bubble!

**My message is:** When you take out a mortgage, take the above two points into consideration and make sure that if either happens you will still be able to pay the bank otherwise you will lose your home. I am not saying don't take out a mortgage. Just make sure you consider possible future scenarios. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not trying to say other answers are wrong but I believe part of the answer is:

For drunken sex the person who is not intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the intoxicated person (because they cannot defend themselves)

For drunk driving the person who is intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the people on the streets, who do not have a way of defending themselves against a car with a drunk person driving.

When the goal is the well being of the people this makes sense from my point of view. The situations are not comparable because there is alcohol involved, but because the well being of people is at stake and the rules have been made based on that.

I hope I got my point across.  </TEXT>

Because this sub is relatively small your post won't just disappear when downvoted. The result is that even though your post has zero upvotes it will still be visible for people who actually want to help. 

What I am trying to say is: If you post something you'll get two types of replies: The ones you mention but also helpful advice.

<TEXT> I have a slight problem and just wanted to know if you guys went through the same.

I was on 1600-1800 kcal a day for a long time and got used to it. Now I started bulking and really struggle to eat 2400kcal. 

I guess its easy to get there by just eating McD and shit like that. But eating the same healthy and filling stuff I ate before makes it almost impossible. 

What do you guys think? How are you doing it?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If my TDEE for maintenance is 2100 kcal per day (desk job and no sport considered) how much do I need to eat to bulk? 

I understand that the answer should be 2600kcal. But if I go to the gym 3 times a week, the TDEE calculator tells that I need 2400kcal for maintenance (desk job and working out 3 times a week). Do I need to eat 2900kcal?

This always confuses me and is never made clear anywhere. I do leangains and I need +20% maintenance on workout days and -20% on rest days, but I never know what I am calculating from.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand what you say and I 100% agree with the fact that none of these rules are "god given" or simply right. Exactly my viewpoint. Fairness is also a human construct and we should not think that this is a universal rule for the whole universe. 

However I believe that if you are part of a society you should accept the rules and norms of that society. If you do not, then you should also not claim for you the benefits that the society has to offer. Your call. If you claim the benefits and don't follow the rules, I don't like what you are doing and I will express that. Again, such a person should not be forced to do any of what I believe to be correct behavior, but if they don't then I will (and so does /u/pancakessyrup ) comment on that. Personally I think his argument is spot on and flawless. But I accept that it's all a matter of opinion. 

I just want to point out one thing:

I am sure all these people who now say that /u/pancakessyrup is a dick will suddenly agree with him when they have their lives destroyed by a stupid TV show (no matter if guilty or not). Peoples believes go straight out the window when their own ass is on the line. So I can only respect /u/pancakessyrup for being aware of that . </TEXT>

Hansen has the right to do so, but not the obligation. He could choose to let the legal system work and not make the TV show. Nobody is taking that right away from him. It is a matter of opinion.

<TEXT> Sorry to get involved in your thing here. I am not judging and don't care about you. I am just curious:

How would you feel, if a girl lured you into her room and had sex with you when it turns out afterwards it was for a TV show and she was actually only 16 and you are being accused of being a predator on TV. The thing is, maybe you are, maybe you are not. But in case you are not, how would you feel about it?

Edit: The reason why I am asking is: I am sure some of them are predators, and some of them are not. Is it ok to sacrifice the ones who are not, just so you can destroy the ones who are? </TEXT>

At the same time I am guessing you will want constructive criticism. There is one major problem with using an app (or not putting in the necessary effort)

On the left side the tree and the plant should either be completely in focus or completely out of focus. If they are not it ruins the picture. In this particular picture the plant should be completely out of focus and the tree should be in focus judging by how you chose the area that is in focus. If the app is any good, then you should be able to draw on areas that should be in/out of focus. I would love to see how the picture turns out if you change those two points. 

No offense. Seriously.  </TEXT>

Her dad is trying to give her that equation right? He seems to believe the best way is to communicate it via morse code. I don't like the idea, but that's fine. 

I found it weird that he is able to manipulate the watch to do this. After all he has been granted access to an extra dimension and not given unlimited super powers. My friend thinks that he manipulates the watch through gravitation the same way he did when he communicated the first message (sand on the ground). Again, I don't like that idea but that is not my point. 

She looks at the watch, recognizes its morse code and has to leave because her brother is coming back. 

Did she immediately understand and memorize the whole thing?
As far as I understand dad was only able to manipulate gravity in that room. I believe the watch should have been useless once she left the room.  </TEXT>

Last weekend I went to Bruges in Belgium and you know what? London is not that expensive (apart from rent?mortgage) You can do a lot for free and a lot of good food is available for good money. If you're modest you can have a good life and don't even need that much money for it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Almost fainted last night in the gym doing dead lifts. What was the reason? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-24 14:53:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I am currently using the strong lifts 5x5 app and I really like it. It keeps me motivated and I have been to the gym 3 times a week for the last two months which is really good for me. 

I have been able to increase dead lifts from 70 kg to 100kg. Up until 95kg I found it hard, but not too hard. Last Friday I did 100kg for the first time. I did 5x 60kg and then 5x 80 kg as warm ups. Yesterday I was about to try 102.5 kg. However I had to stop. I did 5x 60kg and 5x 80kg warm up. When I wanted to do 5x 92.5kg warm up I did 2 reps and felt funny. I dropped the weight and almost fainted. In the end I was fine and nothing happened but I was very surprised. 

I have lifted that weight before a few times, so what could be the reason. I know that I failed to drink water throughout the day yesterday. Could that be it? Or did I not eat enough? Or is it likely that something else was the reason?

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. Breathing and water seem to be key.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know you and I do not know your background or opinion, so please don't take it personal.

If that is your reasoning then that's fine, but then don't complain later that rents are too high. (I am not saying you do)

I am just saying people have no integrity. They all want things to change but nobody is willing to do anything for it. The only thing people with money understand is if you boycott their BS. And if you want things to change you have to start with the man in the mirror and not just expect others to do the shitty work for you. 

Rents are too high in London? Don't move here or move away.

Rent for a certain flat is unacceptable? Don't move in. 

But then somebody else will move in there and nothing will change anyway and on top of that you don't have a flat and that other person does? Maybe. But maybe at some point everybody refuses this BS and we actually make a difference. Be the change that you want to see. I know it sounds so silly but it is true.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, thanks for your answer. 

For point 1, this is from the second link in the side bar:

+20% maintenance calories on workout days, -20% maintenance on non-workout days. Varying your caloric amounts is important

If it's wrong, why is it in the sidebar?

And for the second point I was considering to do this all in one day three times a week. I have been doing the same exercises for the past 3 months (however as bodyweight exercises). I do not think it would be a problem. Why do you think it would be pointless? 
If I split that over 3 days, I will be in the gym for 30 minutes only. 

EDIT: Sorry, I forgot: My goal is to do a recomp as described in the sidebar link. I do not really want to lose weight or bulk. Just want to look fitter and get stronger. I weigh 79kg and I have been doing bodyweightfitness for the last three months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you got this wrong, but I am not sure. 

There is no grey area. As soon as you download it is illegal. However, when you stream the file is only temporarily on your computer and you have no access to it so that you could copy it. That is why streaming is still ok. Torrenting is not legal anywhere in Europe. This is why you should not use popcorn time in Europe if you are scare of getting caught. Neither the uploading nor the downloading is legal.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Acer S3 Ultrabook won't boot with HDMI cable attached. Please help </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-14 13:01:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,

My SO has an Acer S3 ([this one](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Acer-Aspire-S3-391-53314G52add-Ultrabook.81619.0.html)). We decided to install Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. 

Now the problem is that the laptop won't boot with an HDMI cable attached to it. If you remove the cable it boots fine. If you attach the cable after it booted, it works fine. 

We use a HDMI to DVI cable, but it also does not work with an HDMI to HDMI cable or with a different screen. 

If anybody has had this before, we would really appreciate if you could share your solution. It is nothing bad, just an inconvenience to always remove the cable before booting. 

But I even if it can't be fixed I would like to understand it.

Many thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know there are endless explanations about why people think Leo is still in a dream e.g. the thing with the wedding ring. 

I have a very different problem with the film:

For me as a spectator the film ends after the final scene and I am left to wonder whether he is still trapped in a dream or not. That is fair enough and I guess what Nolan wanted. 

However, when I watch a film, I try to imagine that the characters are real, right? And that is why the ending is bullshit. For me as a spectator the movie stops right there, but for Leo it doesn't. He will come back into the house eventually and see if his totem is still spinning or not. That means for him there are two scenarios: 

1. By the time he comes back into the house the totem stopped spinning and he lives happily with his children
2. He comes back in and the thing is still spinning - He knows he was fooled and is still in a dream. He actually wants to get back into the real world so if this happens, the story is not over for him.

So if Nolan wanted an open ending he should have gotten rid of the totem before anybody (us or Leo) was able to find out if the totem will drop. This way he just fails to tell us the end of the story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, its doesn't actually use up the 5.9 GB. It just downloads all the files that have to be replaced on your current OS. Then, after you have downloaded it, the files on your OS will be deleted and replaced by the new "updated" ones. This way the update initially needs 5.9GB to save to files that were downloaded, but afterwards, you only end of with however much code they added, which is probably not going to be anywhere near 5.9GB. 

But, yes, if you do not have the 5.9GB available on your phone at the time, do it like you said. If you do have the space available, it makes no difference. </TEXT>

* Day 2 - 11 threads: Each day there will be a thread for one of the top 10 countries. In that thread people can post their favourite songs from that country. Top comment will represent that country in the final stage.

* Day 12 thread: There will only be 10 comments in that thread, all the songs from the past 10 days. Top comment/song wins!

I think it would be fund and would give all of us the opportunity to listen to good songs from certain countries. 

I hope this will work. Of course the rules can be adjusted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> None of those will make you happy if you ask me. 

It's the same with men too. If you're looking for a longterm relationship you need somebody who is selfless, positive, independent, has their own friends and is not lazy. You can't live with a person who constantly complains, never does any work at home, is always sad when you do something by yourself and puts herself first no matter how funny or good looking she is. 

However if you have somebody who loves you, wants you to be happy, is going to do their fair share of work, lifts you up and let's you be yourself, she does not have to be beautiful of super funny but I guarantee you'll still be happy with her. 

Edit: If you're in it for the short term, then I agree with you 100% </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/nasebanaru pointed out that there is a wiki article stating how often Japan has apologised in the past. 

However in that same article there is a section "Controversy" which pretty much explains why this is not jet settled. This sums it up nicely:

Criticisms regarding the degree and formality of apology, issued as a statement or delivered person-to-person to the country addressed, and the perception by some that some apologies are later retracted or contradicted by statements or actions of Japan, among others.

<TEXT> And my children will watch it too. For that exact reason. 

I believe Jack and Daniel together are perfect and need each other. As much as Daniel has perfect morals and ethics, he so often needed Jack to decide how to go about things. Because perfect morals only work in a perfect world. Jack was the realist who made sure to achieve the best, most ethical outcome considering the actual situation they were facing. He always understood Daniel and I believe always agreed with him. But he always pretended to disagreed with Daniel when he had to make difficult decisions. To Daniel it looked like Jack didn't understand but in fact he was protecting Daniel's unshakable faith in the good by taking the responsibility for the sacrifices they had to make.

<TEXT> Well, I have no analysis. If that is how it works, then the movies is doing it right. I have no proof or argument. I understand your explanation and can understand what you mean. 

So in your mind he is travelling to a time that co-exists with the time you are remaining in, right? He is in the future, you are in the past but both of you exist at the same time, right?

In my mind, there is only "one time". Imagine it as a piece of string. 

--------------------A----------------B-------------------C--------------------

At any given point (A, B or C) in time everybody can be somewhere in space (3 dimensional space) e.g. London, Chicago, etc. Everybody can freely move in that space, but cannot move freely along the string. Everybody moves from A to B to C at the same speed, 1 minute per minute (if that makes sense). Now what the time machine allows the traveler to to is to:

a) travel backwards and forwards

b) travel at different speeds

However, whilst it is traveling through time, it does not travel through space (it remains in London). 

Now from my point of view, whenever two people are at the same point in time and space, they should be able to see each other. That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling). 

Now normally we assume that a time machine has to move fast to start the time travel (like in back to the future). When the Delorean starts his journey, he goes really fast before time travel starts. However he also moves in space which is why you cannot see him during time travel. You can only see him again, when he comes back to that same place that he has left from. 

But in The Time Machine the machine does not move in space whilst it is time traveling. I am sure you will agree with my example above where I said (*"That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling"*). But everything that traveling from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 means is to travel from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8:00:01am to 8:0:02am to 8:00:03 am and so on, just faster than everybody else. So at each of these points you and the traveler are at the same place at the same time, just that he got there quicker than you. And being at the same place at the same time means, you can see each other.

This is as good as I can explain it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry to be difficult. I just want to understand why you think that. 

I personally think it should be like this:

As an example:

at 8:00am the machine starts and you can see it because it has not yet left - here we all have the same understanding

at 8:01am you are still standing in the room, for you, 1 minute has passed. For the traveler (assuming he is traveling at 60x speed) 1 second has passed but still at 8:01am both of you are still in the room. 

at 9:00am it is still the same. 1 hour has gone by for you, for the traveler 1 minute went by, but both of you are still in the room. 

This is the case for every second of every minute of every hour. Both of you are always in the room at the same time. It is not like for the time traveler a "different universe is opening" and he is travelling through an alternative time. Same universe, same time, just at different speeds.

Please explain why I should not be able to see him?

<TEXT> I also considered that point. However, I do not think it does though, because when he travels, the changes around him actually have an influence on the machine (it is moving backwards and forwards whilst he is travelling because something is happening to the ground, if I remember correctly).

What do you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the machine is travelling to the future, it is still always in the same place.

I don't know you so I can't tell whether I like you as a person. But I can safely say that now you look really good, healthy and active. Before you looked, let's say different.

How do you feel about the difference in attention people are giving you? I'm gonna assume (again without knowing your personality) that before you did not get much attention, if any. I'm sure you loads now and compliments as well. 

I read lots about overweight people saying that they are invisible to other people. What is your experience? Now that people give you attention (again an assumption) do you feel they are superficial?

I don't want to forget to say "well done". It must have been incredibly tough but also rewarding.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue with their profits is not that they do not make any at all. They keep them low by paying a franchise fee to the starbucks mother ship in the Netherlands. That means the starbucks coffe shops make no profit, because they have to pay a high franchise fee. Therefor they do not pay any tax on their profit here. Star bucks in the Netherlands however makes huge profit but as far as I know the tax level is ridiculously low there (plus they employ several legal tricks to keep it low). 

In conclusion, they problem is that they are evading tax in a legal way. It is legal, but unethical. </TEXT>

American foreign debt is in US Dollars, because it's the currency the entire world uses. If people would ask for their money back, America could just print money.

<TEXT> I will start by saying I am pro universal healthcare. 

You have pointed out the problem of the "old" system. Those who are poor or ill do not get / can't afford it. Universal healthcare makes sure that our society as a whole makes sure everybody is taken care of.

The benefits are that:
- Everybody is insured
- Even if you are an idiot and don't know what is important you still have health insurance (poor and rich)
- People are not bankrupted because they have to have expensive surgery (poor and rich)
- Price of treatment in general is much much much lower in countries with universal healthcare 

Yes the rich participate with a bigger share but they are rich so that can afford it. They also benefit from it and after paying their share they are still rich (it's not like it's making anybody poor). </TEXT>

does anybody know where we could go?

I deal with many European oil and gas manufacturers. Many of them Italian and British.

For some reason the British have such a low opinion of Italian and other southern European countries and always tell me I should not buy there and that nobody can compete with British manufacturers. 

Truth is, British manufacturers are slow, expensive, their customer service is bad, their manufacturing equipment old and their quality questionable at best. All they have left is a bright history and they seem to think that's a good enouh reason to buy from them.

Any chance you will wake up and acknowledge that mainland Europe is miles ahead of you? </TEXT>

- I did not say iPhones are shit or not good. I just said that they are no. 2 on the list. 

I personally dislike that fact that people perceive the iPhone to be the best phone you can get because you can get something that is (in my personal opinion better) at least equal for a lot less money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said that iPhones are no good. They are great, but I think Android phones are better which makes iPhones the contender. Everything I am saying. iPhones are perceived to be the best because of high profits and premium image but I personally think that from a quality, performance for money and usability perspective they are inferior.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am just ever so slightly changing the question:

I went to a wedding. Saw an old friend of mine who I haven't seen in years (we call him James). I left the wedding early, because my girlfriend was unwell. 

The next day another friend of mine (Mike) asks me: Is that guy James your friend? I say yes. Mike then tells me that James told him (Mike) how he loved him and missed him and wished that they would spend more time together and nothing is the same anymore, bla bla bla. 

Turns out, James though Mike was me. And only because we both shave our heads.

<TEXT> Ok, I feel like these are not popular at all, but from my point of view Lenovo tablets are unbeatable. 
I had the first gen ([this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-8-inch-Tablet-Silver-Metal/dp/B00G459J5W)). I love it. It is not very fast and the Lenovo skin is not great, but I installed Nova launcher and then its fine. You get SD card support and the screen is fantastic in my opinion. For browsing and watching movies it is great because it has the stand. Battery life is incredible. 

Now they launched the new generation ([here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-YOGA-10-1-Tablet-Silver/dp/B00O636JFW/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers ie=UTF8 qid=1416244949 sr=1-1 keywords=yoga+tablet+2)). They both come in 10 inch and 8 inch. And the new generation also comes with Windows 8.1. I really think this is a great product. And the prices are really reasonable.

<TEXT> Please ELI5: 

When the ambient temperature is low, temporarily decreasing the temperature setting on a building's programmable thermostat (e.g. at night or when it is unoccupied) rather than maintaining a steady temperature can save a significant amount of energy.[304] A common myth is that if the building is allowed to cool, its furnace has to "work harder" to reheat it to a comfortable temperature, counteracting or even exceeding the energy saved while the temperature was allowed to drop. Actually this practice can result in energy savings of five to fifteen percent as the heat lost by a warm structure in a cold environment is proportional to the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the structure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you. I also live in one of those shitty areas. Even though I like it anyway I am really looking forward to the improvements. However I don't think improvements always have to be the same shit. Cleaning up and improving infrastructure is great. Also some nice pubs are great. But I don't need shopping opportunities everywhere and I don't need all the chains everywhere. If I wanna go there I can take the bus to central. I like the independent restaurants and I don't need them to face tough competition. They don't seem to make loads of money anyway but I like their food and the facet that they are locals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you. I think the problem is that:

- It easy for people to make music now. Access to instruments and digital instruments is cheap and everybody has a PC
- Publishing on the internet is easy 
- people are stupid

Conclusion is that there is a lot of shit music that is published and stupid people consume it which is why it is on the radio all day.

BUT, people with skill have been making better music every year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not my original thought but: 

We should all be against it for one reason: The argument "somebody who's got nothing to hide has got nothing to fear" is BS because accepting that puts you in the position to have to explain yourself. The government should not be able to look at all your shit and ask: why, what, when? What if you haven't done anything but struggle to explain something that looks dodgy? 

The government should be the one having to explain why there is a good reason to investigate you. 

this is not about protecting us from terrorists, this is about protecting the normal people from the government.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, he does not explicitly say it but I feel he wants more money they more the song gets played but still wants the price for Spotify to be higher. 

The way I see it I either:

- Pay once and own it forever (higher amount)
- Pay regularly and get access (lower amount)

I simply will not pay for Spotify if it costs me $50 per month.

<TEXT> I used to think that religion is the biggest problem we have on earth. I used to think that Muslims hate Christians and vice versa.

However I have come to the conclusion that the problem is not religion at all. It is that a large percentage of people are greedy, aggressive and stupid. The majority of these people that make up the followers of Islam and Christianity are no Muslims or Christians, they are idiots. They do not follow the teachings of their religion in the slightest. The cherry pick the rules that they follow and do not give a shit about many of the rules that actually are not at all optional (stealing, murdering, drinking alcohol, having sex, eating certain things, the list is long). 

These people judge other bases on a set of rules that they in no way want to follow themselves and just turn a blind eye to their fellow "believers" and everybody just hops that nobody ever mentions that they are all a bunch of sinners. 

And it the same with non religious people. People say you should do this and that and should not do this and that, but when it comes to it people's beliefs go out the window pretty quickly. And all just because people are greedy. 

I hate humans more than I am able to say and I am sure what I have written does not even begin to explain what I feel. 

I will do my best to live what I preach.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's called 3 ways:
It starts with a scene where a young guy sits in front of a gangster in his office. The guys says, you got three possibilities: Run, lie or do what I am asking you to do. if you don't do what I am asking you to do, I will kill your girlfriend. We will never find out what he did. Not flashbacks (flashbacks are for the prequel)
Then the movie shows all three possibilities at the same time and at the end you will find out which of the three turned out to be the one he should have chosen and which one he chose. 

the movie will constantly switch between the three.

Awesome, right? Anybody wants to buy the script? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I talked to my dad yesterday. It looks like we will go with either squarespace or wordpress (probably wordpress). I really appreciate your help and explanations on this. This has been great. My dad is insisting that I find out more about how people will be able to find us on google. 

He wants us to be able to add some key words somewhere. In his opinion that is what search engines look for. However I keep telling him that a search engine (as soon as they get hold of your website) "read your website" and will show it in their results if the content of your website matches the search entry. May I ask what you say to this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are. I just called them. I am just not 100% sure. My dad trusts me with the whole thing. They only thing he keeps mentioning is: "How can we make sure people will find us on google?" 
Also, one last question. Will I have to pay extra for wordpress? Not a massive problem, just asking. 

Again guys, thank you so much. I honestly appreciate you taking your time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Directly on wordpress, but that was just to get used to it. I actually just called the people from strato.de They said with what my dad bought, there is no wordpress available. They have their own wordpress type thing and I would need to change my package, which is possible without a problem. 

However they said the SEO option we now have included would then not be available. I have no idea if that is BS. 

I really would like to change to wordpress and not use their own tools because it stinks. Will it be difficult for people to find my website on google?

Sorry for these questions. It must be annoying as fuck... </TEXT>

Actually I have tried to do it via wordpress (and I have already set up something that is good enough from my point if view). However I do not know how to transport it to where I have rented the space. I (my dad) rented the space on strato.de because his friend recommended it. Also, will it show that it is a wordpress website at the bottom? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am simply curious. You see it pretty much every day. Bus driver closes his/her doors, drivers for half an inch, sombody knocks on the door and wants to get on, bus driver refuses (and then of course sometimes that person loses it, but anyway). 

I do not actually have a problem with that because buses come every 2 minutes anyway where I live and I think the bus drivers get way too much shit for this. Clearly they are forced to do this. I was just wondering what the rules are the bus dirvers have to follow. Are they only allowed to open doors in the marked areas at bus stops? If so, why? What happens when they do open the door where there are not supposed to?

Actually, writing it down it seems perfectly fine progress. 

I am not actually a beginner. I have worked out very irregularly the last 3 years. but I am not weak. 

No idea about bf%. I don;t know where to measure that.

I am currently working out 3 times a week and trying to eat 1600kcal per day. Should I eat more than that to maintain my muscle?

<TEXT> Hello,

I have tried to ask this in /r/bodyweightfitness but had little luck. I think it might be interesting for many people so I am trying here one more time. 

Please could we collect information on what will happen in the following cases:

(Please assume the following just for the sake of an easy explanation: 2000kcal required for maintenance.)

Cases:

a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out

b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out

d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out

f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

In all of these cases, what will happen to fat and muscle, will it increase, decrease or stay the same?

__

What I am assuming is this, but I think I might be wrong:

a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease

Amount of fat: will decrease

b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase slightly

Amount of fat: will decrease

c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly

Amount of fat: will not change / increase slightly

d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase slightly

Amount of fat: will decrease slightly

e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly

Amount of fat: will increase

f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase

Amount of fat: will increase slightly

__

I would be really thankful if you guys could provide some information. Because at the moment I am not reaching my goals. I am eating -500kcal per day and doing bodyweightfitness 3 times a week . I am losing weight very slowly and hardly putting on any muscle. I am getting stronger though. However I would like to lose fat and gain muscle.

Many thanks in advance.

It is being portrayed in a way that is completely unrealistic and people kind of expect a Disney Land like experience. Also it is not like this applies to the majority of Japanese. I think it is just a few idiots with no sense of reality who fall for the unrealistic image of Paris.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I agree. When you go to Paris with a Parisian and he shows you places where its not horrifically expensive it is amazing. French food and wine is worth the trip alone and in the Summer people in Paris sit by the river and drink all day long like students.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get the HTC M7 then. Full HD 4.7" , premium material. Stil quick enough for all you want to do. I used to have that phone. I also love the sense UI. I only changed to the z3c because of the battery and camera. I don't regret my choice. 

But keep in mind that the HTC One M7 only has a 0.1" bigger screen, but it also has the back and home button separate. The z3c has them on the screen. That means you get a screen with is 0.1" smaller and is also occupied by the navigation button at the bottom.  </TEXT>

However it seems more likely to people that even if they behave correctly, everyone else won't thus putting themselves at a disadvantage. Therefore, they also behave incorrectly.

It is not a good comparison because there are no "rules" for calling an area greater XXX. If they wanted they could call the whole of South West England greater London. 

Edit: Just look at the marked area here. It is just hills and forest. Same with all North East of it.

Can I ask what you are planning to integrate apart from Fb (which I don't really read) and twitter (which I don't really use?). Are you going to I crude an RSS reader? Or reddit? If that would be the case I'd be super interested in using it. 

However I also think it would be better if it was an launcher with a dedicated home screen where I can add my widgets. 

Or maybe slide left to a screen where you can only add widgets which can also be scrolled down just like the app drawer? Then it would be everything I need.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got one for you. Maybe not original but at least never heard of it. 

You know how Google Picasa and other softwares ask you to tell them what the name of a face is that the software recognises on your pics? It is linked to a contact in your phone. In case you save your contacts with full name they know the name of that person and their face (also tel no and possibly email,  bla bla bla). Now as soon as the software knows the name and possible waits for a verification from a different user they start tracking where ever that person was. Somebody is taking a picture of something with me in the background? Picasa saves geo data and tells Google where I was that day at that time. This way a map is created of where I went with evidence. Could be used to prove you haven't done this or that but it will only be used against you.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My trusted salesman at my trusted running equipment shop seriously advised me not to use Nike free runs. What do you think? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-12 16:19:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to a Nike outlet to buy some running shirts and shorts and saw that the Nike Hyperfeel were only 80 so I bought a pair. I ran in them today and I liked it. 

By chance I walked past my usual shop and went in because I was curious what my usual salesman had to say about them. 

Long story short. He said that:
- Nike uses some of the worst foams in the industry which don't provide good support
- He has a ton of customers that came into his shop because they have trouble with their achilles tendon and their knees after using any nike free run shoes. 
- Even walking for long periods of time is bad for knees and achilles tendon. He said that if I run with them (I am quite heavy and mostly land on the back of my foot) I will have problems in the future with my hip and knees
- They basically are a shit shoe that costs nothing to make (he said $2.50 but I am not sure if he was just saying a low number) and is being sold with a ridiculous profit margin thanks to Nike's marketing.
- it has been developed in Germany at the Sporthochschule Koeln and that some people involved make their money with knee replacements
- on top of all of that he does not sell Nike because for him it is a fact that they use child labour (however he does realise that this is a difficult discussion. Anyway it is his shop so it's his choice)

He was able to explain everything very well and I have to say that I believe him but I could not find anything online so I am curious where he gets this information. 

What do you gusy think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been doing bodyweight fitness for a short while now and I really like it. I feel good because I am doing something to improve my body. I cannot yet see a big difference but the fact that I am working out regularly makes a big difference to my state of mind. However, there is a downside. Well, two actually.

1. My thighs have become bigger and now my suits do not fit me anymore. I can almost not wear my trousers anymore when I have my phone and wallet in my pockets. 

2. I am not sure if I am imagining this, but because there is less space available between my thighs and also in my trousers, my testicles started hurting. 

Has anybody had a similar experience? 
Any suggestions how to deal with it?

https://github.com/CyanogenMod-11/android_kernel_htc_m7

But I do not know how. I understand that you need the zip and need to flash it in the recovery. I downloaded the zip on that page (right side of the screen) but it always says failed, when I try to flash it. 

Do you guys know how to do it?

Many thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I was given "the hundred year old man who climbed out of the window and disappeared" as a present and have started reading it. I do not see at all, how this is supposed to be a good book. What do you think? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-26 23:13:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Like said I got it as a present which is why I am reading it. 

I saw that it has 7000 reviews on amazon.co.uk with 4.5 stars average which I think means that it is a very popular book. Also I heard lots of people talk about it. 

I have read the first 80 pages and really struggle to keep reading. The reasons are:

- The life of the protagonist seems super unrealistic. I read it and think that even though I know it's fiction there is no way I can believe this story or identify myself with it. 
- The jokes he makes seem calculated and also it seems like it's not genuine. It seems like he has taken the kind of humour from somebody else because it was successful.
- Last but not least I read, that he wote a second book which follows the exact same scematic as this one. I dislike that because it lacks heart. 

What do you gusy think? Shall I keep reading? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What can I expect from bodyweight fitness? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-06 19:54:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, 

I have started bodyweight fitness but would like to learn a bit more about the results that I can expect if I am diligent. 

My primary goal is not to gain strength for the sake of it. I would say that I don't lack strength because I have always been working out. I am a little too fat though and I find that I cannot move the way I would like to because of it.

My goal is to get rid of some of my fat and get lean. I do not actually want to get a lot bigger because I have very wide shoulders as it is and I am quite short. I have started the routine that is suggested in one of the top posts (the one that has a picture of all the different progressions in it. I was able to star pretty much everything in the middle.

I would love to know if other people had the same goal and if they succeeded.

Oh, and I want to be able to do one armed push ups, of course. ;)

I'd appreciate any feedback. Progression picks always good </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is this a possible solution for our never ending universe? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-25 11:30:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I have been reading some books and saw one video trying to explain 11 dimensions. Then I had a though. I am really not good at explaining it but I'll try my best.

Maybe the universe is not actually endless, it is just a closed loop. Imagine somebody who is only able to perceive 1 dimension. his world looks like this ------------ . He can move left and right. If you put both ends of his world together you get a circle. Now if the person would walk left (or right) for long enough he would realise he is living on a cirlce because he will get back to the start. Now if the circle is bigger than the person can travel in a lifetime, he will never get back to the start and will therefore think his universe in endless. 

If you apply the same to a 2D world the person can walk left, right, up and down. Again, his world might seem endless to him, but in fact it might just be a sphere too big for him to travel across in one lifetime. 

Now what if that is the same with our universe? Maybe it is actually folded in such a way that whichever direction you traveled you would eventually get back to Earth. Because we live in it and cannot perceive the next dimension up, our minds cannot picture such a folded 3D object but that doesn't mean its not possible. 

For me this would be much easier to understand that to grasp infinity.

I hope I explained myself good enough for people to understand. 

TL;DR: Universe is not actually infinite, just a folded 3D onject (similar to a circle in 1D and a sphere in 2D). We will just never find out because it is too big for us to travel.
