<TEXT> This is still a bug that has not been fixed.   It is a problem that has to be effecting a large number of users who assume when they see the forbidden message that the problem is that Reddit doesn't want them submitting, period.  So they give up and go do something else.  I know how to work around it, but it is annoying as heck.  

Please look into fixing it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is still a problem.    I've explained in other comments in this thread exactly what causes the problem and how it could be easily fixed.   

This is really annoying.  And while I know how to get around it, I'll bet it is effecting many users who just think Reddit is them that they are not allowed to submit, period.  

Please look into fixing it.    Thank you.  </TEXT>

If it's from a budget he controls, then he would get a to determine how it's spent.  In such a case, I would guess it would be something he farmed out to a Chief of Staff or something, which hopefully Sanders will be correcting the situation shortly.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> /r/Bestof allows any subreddit to opt-out per mod request.    

They can have a permanent opt-out forever.   Automod will enforce that.   

Or they can request removals piecemeal on a per-submission basis.   

/r/Bestof always respects a mod teams rights to not be highlighted at /r/Bestof.  

Likewise, we don't allow the subreddit to be used for witch hunts or in efforts to get somebody down voted.   If a submission to /r/Bestof is highlighting a comment people would normally want to down vote, we'll remove it.   /r/Bestof is meant to be a positive experience and the /r/Bestof mod-team won't allow it to be used as an attack platform.  

We work with other teams and the admins to keep the *Best of* experience positive for everyone.    </TEXT>

Oh, wait..... I did publicly post all that info and revel in taking credit for it.  

Considering I take credit for all this stuff, cause I like my badges of honor..... you're problem isn't that I did something bad.  It's that I did something good.  That others are seeing how my previous mod work was very good and are using it as the basis to stop you and your little nazi-wanna-be friends.

<TEXT> Don't bullshit me.    The *ethics in journalism* line is total fucking bullshit of the highest order.   It's a lie you guy's KNOW is a lie but say it anyway.   That subreddit lacks all ethics.  

What is /r/KotakuInAction about:

See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv31/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1qs7n) by /u/str1cken.  It will tell you want that subreddit is about.    I'll cut and paste the comment here.  

 gt;I haven't seen any personally "nasty stuff" about Pao

 gt;Nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race.

Hey there!

I was curious about this myself, so I did a little bit of research.

Right now 16 of the top 20 posts *of all time* in KiA are about Ellen Pao directly (the post includes her name in the title) or indirectly (either about policies she has made or holding her responsible for things happening on reddit).

Weird, right? This sub is 10 months old but 80% of the top-upvoted posts in the subreddit are about Ellen Pao. Huh.

I know, I know : It's actually about ethics in games journalism.

Here are some choice net-positive-vote-total comments from just the top 5 Pao-related posts on KiA:

"[Arrogant bitch defines Ellen Pao quite well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csrq9ha)" [+222]

"[ekjp...

"[YOU'VE BEEN BANNED FROM /R/PAOYONGYANG[1] FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON:

"[the vile and corrupt slime that is Chairman Pao](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3bzdxz/censorship_rpics_is_automatically_or_manually/csqyrk0)" [+61]

"[I feel personally attacked by this bitch. In our culture, we disembowel poeple like her, stuff her with lemon grass and roast her on a fire pit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c4tvh/100000_people_have_now_signed_the_changeorg/csshjcw)" [+56]

"[She's an utter cunt, to the fullest effect.

"Even on females, the genitals can be a pretty useful target." Username EllenPaosSidewaysVag responds : "[I'm counting on that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/378smw/a_joke_making_fun_of_reddit_ceo_ellen_pao_is/crkof09)" [+27]

"[Pao Zedong is crazy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csrq90m)" [+23]

"[We should send this bitch to North Korea and then see how much she likes censorship.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c4tvh/100000_people_have_now_signed_the_changeorg/cssi5fn)" [+20]

"[All hail our glorious leader, Chairman Pao! May she forever reign from her seat in Paoyang!](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csrpq3c)" [+16]

"[She's the kind of cunt who screams for a lawsuit when she doesn't get her way.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/378smw/a_joke_making_fun_of_reddit_ceo_ellen_pao_is/crku52z)" [+10]

"[Worst blow job i ever got in my life was from that skank.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/378smw/a_joke_making_fun_of_reddit_ceo_ellen_pao_is/crkqs37)" [+9]

(Regarding Ellen Pao's lawsuit:) "[kung pao suey](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csru7q0)" [+5]

"[Fuck you, Ellen Pao.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csruoqk)" [+3]

"[fuck this asian cunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c4tvh/100000_people_have_now_signed_the_changeorg/csshprz)" [+3]

"[ellen pao is a cunt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csrwkx9)" [+3]

"[If anyone deserves a cunt-punt ... fucking pathetic bag of stupid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/378smw/a_joke_making_fun_of_reddit_ceo_ellen_pao_is/crl0vf8)" [+2]

So let's put that one to bed : Plenty of KiA users have said and upvoted "nasty stuff" about /u/ekjp and there's definitely more than "nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race." </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.  

For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine BS and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.  The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.  

Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.  

There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in their attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Homophobes, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.  

These radical nuts run subreddits like: /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European,  /r/Holocaust (holocaust deniers), /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc. 

Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

If they don't take care of it, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.    

Another point that largely gets  ignored in this debate:  Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist and hate-group users generally strive to drive out the non-racist users.    

Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) try and only talk about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.     But when it comes to non-family, you don't make the same allowances.    We just cut those people out of our lives.   

Bad users will drive out good users.  And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.  And it will become a bad-user reinforcement-cycle with more and more bad users driving out, they hope, all the good users.    These groups even know this, and count on the non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like *Colonizing*, as they are actively attempted to take the entire site over.  That is their goal.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into more racist bigots.     If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.    

Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).

Other web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups. It's high time that Reddit did the same. 

I also want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means "Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on "Free Speech" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly. 

In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to make Reddit into a hate-propaganda site.   Hopefully the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.

<TEXT> /u/Blackstar9000, good to hear from you again.  And good to hear that you generally agree with me.  I didn't see this thread until just now.   Next time maybe shoot me a PM please.  

I see most of the other points I would have made in response to you already made by some others in this thread, so I won't bother repeating them.   

But I do want to reiterate one point that I think was large ignored.   Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist users generally drive out non-racist users.

Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly. 

In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to eliminate people they disagree with.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except that the best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.  

For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.    

The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.  

Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.  

There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in the attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.  

These radical nuts run subreddits like /r/Holocaust (holocaust denial), /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc. 

Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.    

/u/Spez's post here gives me hope that, at long last,  the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.  </TEXT>

Daeres is a very good moderator.  He's not some kind of crazy guy who sends in 5000 tanks to crush the bones of his enemies beneath them, like georgy_k_zhukov.   He's more interested in utilizing highly controlled air power to bomb out a city center and then secretly poisoning the local water supply.   And that is when he releases the genetically modified killer hamsters with lasers on their heads into the ecosystem.    

From a mod perspective, it's never a simple banning.  It really can be a thing of pure beauty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /r/Technology was removed as a default by the admins after I resigned in a very public way from the mod team.   It was the lack of actions by the mods who refused to improve the subreddit that caused the admins to remove it as a default subreddit.   [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3) for info on what happened. 

As to the Automod config that I helped author at /r/Technology, it has ended up being used at more than half the current default subreddits.   You act like that is some kind of shame for me, but get this: **I'm proud of that fact**. It was and still is a great configuration. Heck, /r/Technology is still using the majority of it right this second. 

The other mods there with me, /u/Agentlame, /u/Skuld, TheSkyNet, etc. all of us resigned in protest at the inactivity of our then fellow moderators.   Fellow mods who refused to discuss anything at all about how the subreddit should function.    Of course, we were of the opinion that a subreddit called /r/Technology should actually be focused on technology, not ancillary topics like business, marketing, politics or simple news.    Stock price fluctuations are not about technology.   A simple car fire is not a r/Technology story.    News stories have a large subreddit called /r/News that exists for them.   And political stories have a large subreddit called /r/Politics for them. 

My degrees are in computer science.  Software and hardware are technology.   Stock price is not.   An article about how a new type of electric car works is technology, where as an article about the current stock price of the electric car company is not.    

Heck, the haters figured out we were doing the right thing after we resigned.  That was why lots of people demanded the resignation of the old do-nothing mods and many of the new mods after we left.

<TEXT> Web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups.   It's time for Reddit to do the same.  

When a site allows racists to run wild, good users will leave because they will not wish to associate with racists.   In effect, bad users will drive out the good users.  Those users who leave are replaced by more bad users who are attracted by the permissive attitude.   By allowing racists free reign, they will proliferate and become an even larger problem.

<TEXT> There are many things were there are NOT two sides to the issue.   There is just the correct view, and the wrong view.    For example, evolution does not have two sides to the debate.  Instead what you have people who believe in science and complete and utter morons.  The anti-science idiots have no right to their opinion.   Period.  

This is true of several issues.   Evolution is is real.   Climate Change is real.  The Holocaust happened.  The US Civil War was about Slavery.   Anti-vaccine hysteria is bullshit.     

/r/Science does not allow comments from people who don't believe in evolution, spread anti-vaccine propaganda, or deny climate science.   The same goes for other science based subreddits such as /r/askscience and /r/Biology.    

[An article](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) written by /u/Nallen on why /r/Science does not allow Climate Change deniers. 

Likewise, /r/History and it's fellow history-based subreddits such as /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory do not allow Holocaut Denial, Ancient Aliens BS, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crap, Neo Nazi propaganda, and other forms of history denial. 

And I'm sorry, but these are not topics that the mod-teams of these subreddits are going to open up for debate.  Because there is no debate about them by anyone except hate-based groups who are knowingly pushing hate-based agendas.    If you do not like these mod-policies, then you are free to unsubscribe from our subreddits immediately.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been very disappointed in the reddit community for a while now.   There were often submissions to backwater hate-based subreddits about Ellen Pao that had comment chains which were all comments about her sex and race.  This was well before the blow ups with the mods.  Nominally the news story submissions were about her law suit with her former employer, but they were all nothing more than excuses for idiots to gather round an make  sexist and racist comments.  

Subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/SubredditCancer, /r/Undelete, /r/KotakuInAction, /r/Redpill, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/GreatApes, etc. all made common-cause in the effort to say nasty stuff about Pao.  Then when the ruling about FPH was handed down, they made sure to invite all those hate-based users into their idiot-clubhouses.  

When the mods of the defaults acted, independent of of any of that crap, those idiots pored out of the word work again.    Mod teams wanted to make sure that our users and the press knew that we didn't care about Ellen Pao's lawsuit or be thought to be in common cause with a bunch of hate-based idiots.  At /r/History we threw together a [wiki-page to explain our reasons for going dark](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/timer).    

Now something that needs to be addressed very quickly are the various hate-based groups which are actively attempting to *colonize* (their word) parts of reddit.   Several hate based groups of white supremacist, neo nazis, holocaust deniers, etc. are setting up shop around Reddit.  
 
Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

As such, the admins need to directly address the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/Holocaust and other subreddits that solely exist as propaganda outlets for pure hate.     If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it. 

I've been saying this [since before](https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/3c7pj1/rmodtalk_seems_like_a_very_levelheaded_community/cstg9jt?context=3) Ellen Pao resigned.   I'm saying it now.  I will continue to say it in the future.

<TEXT> It's one thing to see a good and bad side to various issues, but there are some things are primarily one or the other.   And by vast orders of magnitude.   For example,  white supremacist hate groups are bad.   I think we can credibly say that without worrying about extraneous factors.   

The same goes for similar groups that espouse holocaust denial, proponents in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crazies, believers that all-Muslims are terrorists, etc.   One also finds that these other fringe groups all have more than a small amount of overlap with the white supremacist racist groups.   So much so that I think we can begin to speak of them as one large hate-feast. 

Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).

<TEXT> I didn't remove those for personal grudge.  I removed them because those idiots were using /r/Ideasfortheadmins for their personal grudges.   And I would remove it again today for the same reason.  

You want to believe BS, you can believe it all you want.  But it's still BS.

If people want message mod teams, there is a link of the sidebar of every subreddit that does just that.   It's very easy for them to use it.   But they always want to act like it's something only rocket scientists can figure out.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not just /r/AskHistorians, but a whole bunch of subreddits, from /r/History, /r/science, /r/askscience, /r/Biology, /r/BadHistory, /r/HistoryPorn,  and even none history or science topic subreddits.   Places like /r/Politics, /r/Bestof, /r/GetMotivated, /r/Apple, /r/AskReddit, /r/IAMA, /r/todayilearned, etc.  All have varying rule-sets they use for comments and submissions.   Some remove not much more than the rules of Reddit require, but all will remove a bit more than the admins require.   Even if it's just blatant mass-postings of profanity  (Things like the word "FUCK" repeated hundreds of times), to racism, trolling, etc.  

Mod teams get to define these rules.   If users don't like it, they can discuss it with the mods or use another subreddit.  There are thousands of subreddits out there.   But /r/History is never going to allow Holocaust denial.      And while Spez has now said the didn't mean to effect this, some undesirable users are going to point to his comment to play bullshit rules lawyer games.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just going to cut and paste what I just posted in /r/Modtalk. 

---  

/r/History removes hundreds, if not thousands, of comments on a daily basis.  This is true for several subreddits.  We also ban people a lot for breaking our rules against history-denial.   Holocaust denial is just the #1 form of history-denial.   There are several other types.  

/r/AskHistorians is the same way.   Same with /r/HistoryPorn, /r/BadHistory and several other subreddits.  

/r/Science bans science-denial, be it climate change denial, creationists, anti vaxxers, etc.   Same with lots of other science-based subreddits. 

The mods of these subreddits use all the tools at our disposal to deal with these idiots.  Regular bans, Automod-bans, automod rule sets for both comments and submissions, and we even have more specific bots that enforce rules where automod can't.   And we still have a lot of mod-work that needs to be done to keep our subreddits properly clean and curated. 

If /u/Spez thinks moderators are going to have to tolerate these assholes ruining our subreddits, and their agenda-pushing political bullshit, then he should just cut to the quick and resign as CEO right now.  

---

I will say that Spez is now trying to engage with moderators, but it's just beginning.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing that I think the admins are going to need to directly address is the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/Holocaust and others there exist solely to spread hate.   

Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shitholes on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylann Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

This info was brought to my attention by /u/PraiseBeToScience in another discussion.   I didn't know the problem was that extreme already.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit. Or any other corporation for that matter.   This is something that they need to address.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully the media pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Confederate Constitution forbade states from ever amending their constitution from interfering with the institution of slavery.  The Confederate Constitution made slavery a forever pact that could never be removed.   They loved states rights so much that at the beginning of their attempt-a-country they limited the power of states rights.  

I'm sorry, but there were no other real issues involved in the American Civil War.  All the other ancillary issues are the slavery question in disguise.

<TEXT> The reason Lincoln eventually became anti-Slavery late in the war is that he realize it was the root cause of the Civil War.    The country couldn't exist with it and not fight Civil Wars.  If you ban it, then you get rid of the root problem of the war.   

The Confederacies own leaders said they were fighting the war for slavery.   The Cornerstone Speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens explains point black the the Southern States were attempting to found a new nation based on ""upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition".  

So Lincoln decided that to win the war for real, Slavery had to be eliminated.   After the war, the former Southern leaders took to rewriting their own history to say that they were fighting for other things.   Normally bringing up States Rights, but also talking about the Southern Agrarian Economy, Tax issues, Tariff policies,  etc.   But each of those alternate explanations for the war are all really just the slavery question in disguise.  

Southern Economy was based on slavery. 

Tax issues, around profits made from goods produced by slavery. 

Tariffs on products again produced by slavery. 

States rights, to own people as farm animals.  

Slavery is the core issue the war was about.    Every other issue involved in the war was, at it's heart, also the slavery issue.  

After the war, Confederate General James Longstreet was asked what the Civil War was fought over.  His response was simple:  "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".   He knew what his war was about.  Saying it was about anything else is outright lying.  

Frederick Douglass became one of the people who helped turn Lincoln into the *Great Emancipator* after his death.    Douglass understood that Lincoln had figured out that the root cause of the war was slavery and that he then fought to destroy the very institution that caused the war.   </TEXT>

You link to a bunch of stuff that is wrong about a whole bunch of things and you don't care about basic facts either.   For example, I didn't get kicked out at /r/Technology, [I quit and told the world why I quit](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3)

As to /r/Europe.... [I said this](https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c0m0a/why_reurope_went_private/csrbiaw?context=3) a few days ago.   Mod leaks showing I was doing the right thing.   The same thing the remaining mods there are continuing to do currently.  Like that guy I am sure basic facts are outside your purview and I'm not going to waste any more of my time talking to you.   

I like how you see good supporters of you as people who uses usernames with K.K.K. in them.  [Look at what he mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoonTown/about/moderators).   Which tells the world everything they need to know about you and your so-called friends.  You don't know anything you are taking about.  If you said the sky was blue I would 100% know it wasn't.  </TEXT>

From what I can gather I think it has something to do with controlling the coffee futures market.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dzneill singlehandedly ran the help-based subreddits for years.   Everything in /r/Help, /r/Modhelp, /r/ideasfortheadmins, etc. was answered by him.    He stopped doing it at one point because.... well, basically back in the day he never got attention from the admins when it was needed.      They just ignored all the good work he was doing for them.   I am still very disappointed in how they treated DZ back then.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not true.   I was the mod who took /r/History private.   /u/Creesch later put it back online a few hours after /u/Nallen made /r/Science public again.   They were made public again because /u/kn0thing made threads in /r/Modtalk and /r/Defaultmods and seems to be addressing the issues.   Getting his direct attention was the goal.    

OF course, the fact that it took several hours to get the attention is still a bit whacked.

<TEXT> I was removing racist bullshit from here.   Things I continue to remove from other subreddits I mod to this day.   Heck, the thread you guys complained because you thought I remove was **NOT even removed by me**.   It was removed by another mod of /r/Europe who is **still** a mod here.    But I stood by his removal and continue to stand by it.    Removal of that thread was the correct action.  It's still removed at this time.  The current mod team here continues to remove similar threads every day.   Not that you care really, because facts are actually unimportant to you.  

Racism and hate are a major problem on Reddit.  We know this because the Users of /r/Europe have said it was a problem. See these threads from /r/Europe on the storm front problem:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3fnr/seems_we_are_important_enough_for_stormfront_to/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/

And it's a problem faced by all of Reddit.   For example, the definitive /r/History comment statement on the problem.  

* https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2puapu/alfred_hitchcocks_memory_of_the_camps_very_nsfw/cn0a25e?context=3

The history-based subreddits of /r/History, /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians, /r/BadHistory, etc. all ban users for racist and hate-filled opinions every day.  Be they racism, holocaust denial, NeoNazis, NeoConfederates, Pro-Slavery or simple history-fact denial.    World War Two happened, denying it will get you banned for that alone.   And no, the mod teams don't care if you agree with how we mod the subreddits.   If you don't like it, then you are free to unsubscribe at your earliest opportunity.  

Back to the issue of subreddits going private, /r/History was taken private after a long discussion among the mod team.  We were the fourth default subreddit to go private.  Only a few minutes after /r/Movies did so.   I was the one who made the setting change to take it private.   

We then made it available again after the Admins had made statements in various backroom mod-only subreddits.   /r/Science had already decided that it was time to come back, and we followed suit because the admins will giving the stated mod-issues the required attention.   

Others links that explain what was happening follow:

* [OutoftheLoop thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/)
* [Subreddit Drama thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/)
* [Bestof Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3bw7ms/top_mod_of_riama_explains_why_its_been_set_to/)

In short, mods doing their jobs are important for Reddit.   Mod tools have not been updated in several years.   Tools like /r/Toolbox which were created by people like /u/Creesch and /u/Agentlame are stop gap measures that they themselves have asked for the admins to copy their work for the benefit of all communities on Reddit.    

I could continue to go on here, but you won't read it and aren't really interested in what I am saying.  But somebody else might be interested in the actual facts, and so I post this answer for them.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, this is new the definitive reddit-link/work on the subject.   

The only thing I would add is a quote from former Confederate General James Longstreet, responding to a question asking him what he thought the cause of the Civil War was: "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".  

But then, Neoconfederate apologists don't care about actual facts.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sister, who is big into Facebook has never heard of Reddit.   Well, except from when I occasionally mention it while she is going on about how great Facebook is.  The vast majority of Americans just don't care.   That said, there is a semi-important marketing demographic some advertisers like.   Too many Redditors think that makes them important, when in reality it just makes them a target demographic to mine for money.   People still don't really care about them at all.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> IIRC, for about 5 minutes way back in the dawn times, it was the default way reddit worked briefly.   But it was killed by one of the First Ones and made optional cause lots of people were angered by it's existence.  Mainly cause it did weird things and took a long time to get used to when you did try and use it.   It seemed to be effected by a lot of weird things, such as different reddit preferences, browser settings, planetary alignments and whether you were into Star Trek or Star Wars.  And lord....  you don't want to know what happened to people who tried using it but were into Star Search.    They were flung into Stargate haven't been heard from since.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was talking to a feminist activist once who told me about how she got a bunch of complaining mens-rights guys coming to her blog where she was writing about how she worked to set up a woman's shelter.    She took a few of them at their word and decided to try and help them with setting him a men's shelter.    Instead of working with her they just called her names.   

A lot of those guys don't want to help men.  They just want to complain that sometimes woman are successful.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've  never really understood the whole "I don't like it so we must disallow it's entire existence" attitude a lot o people have. 

I don't like horror movies, but I don't advocate for a ban on them.  I don't like current Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, but I have not petitioned the government to publicly execute him.   

Why can't people just be okay with things they don't like?   If you don't like Felicia Day, don't read articles she writes or watch videos she puts on the internet.  The Internet is a big place.  

For some reason, that just seems simple.   I guess it's not. 

Of course, I will still never forgive George Lucas for the prequels.   One still has to have some standards.    But something about the billions of dollars tells me that George probably doesn't care what I think.   :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> A former slave responded to a letter from his ex-master after the Civil War.   [See here](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/to-my-old-master.html). 

The ex-master asked him to come back and work his farm.  The former slave responded with a request for 32 years back pay for himself, and 20 years of back pay for his wife.   And he also politely asked for a guarantee from the ex-master to not rape his daughters.   Figuring those were small things to ask for if the ex-master really wanted to just *let bygones be bygones*.

The one big difference is that Obama was younger, good looking and telegenic.   Sanders, while not a lot older than Hillary Clinton (by six years), definitely appears older than she does.   Maybe that shouldn't matter in politics, but it does.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the people truly disagree with the Courts decision, they can elect representatives to amend the Constitution.    What that entails is as follows

* 2/3rds of Congress starting the amendment process.   291 of 435 House votes and 67 of 100 Senate votes.
* 3/4ths (38 of 50) of the State legislature's to pass resolutions approving the amendment.  

Of course, on this issue.... those numbers aren't going to materialize.   Right now it would actually be much easier politically to amend the Constitution to 100% approve the Court's decision for all time rather then repeal it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sister ended up renting the whole conference room area at a major hotel for the wedding.  It included a weekends worth of rooms for the her and her now husband, the wedding party (ushers and brides maids) and both sets of parents.  About 10-12 rooms.  Included a stocked bar for the reception after the civil service they had performed.   All for cheaper than the church wanted for one day in mid-October in the North East.  

And it was at a Church she is an active member of too.   You would think that they would give a break for people who are really members of the Church.  

I'm sorry, but everything about it was crazy.   They got more space, more time, hotel rooms, didn't have to have a cash-bar, etc.   Way more than her own Church could have provided and it was cheaper.   I'm sorry, but that screams greed and nothing else.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a long time it was true.   But as with many things, Reagan didn't like the rule so he appointed judges who disagreed with the idea.   And then in 1994 Gingrich Revolution when the GOP won control of Congress.... the Senate largely only confirms judges who allow Churches a lot of latitude to lobby for candidates.   They get away with saying "We really like Congressman Smith" instead of "We endorse Congressman Smith".    And since they didn't say *endorse*,  they are allowed to all-but-endorse candidates.  

As long as they stop just short of saying "Vote for Congressman Smith", then it's not political.   At least according to a lot of judges out there.  So the IRS and other government agencies that might call them on the lobbying efforts have learned to ignore it except in the most egregious cases.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> "If [the Civil War] wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".  - Confederate General James Longstreet responding to a question as to the cause of the Civil War.  

Coupled with the [Declaration of Causes of Seceding States](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/secession.html) and things like the [Cornerstone Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech) by  Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.... the cause of the war was Slavery.   

All the ancillary other factors that people like to bring up, be it tax issues, tariffs, states rights, the Southern agrarian economy, etc.  Each of those other contributing factors contain slavery at the core of their being.  They can not be discussed in any logical way without directly discussing slavery.   Slavery can not be decoupled from the causes of the American Civil War any more than violence can be decoupled from war itself. 

This means the confederate flag (or the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia if you prefer that name) is all about being a believer in slavery as if it was a good thing.  To say anything else is not just wrong, but willful and maliciously wrong.   </TEXT>

Both are 100% moral and ethical, and any other conclusion can only be based on a denial of human rights.   

Thomas and you may not want to accept this basic fact, but it does not change the basic fact that only way one can justify being against gay-marriage is to deny that gays possess inalienable human rights.   Anything else you might try and claim is bullshit lying on your part.  Your fully understanding that you are lying is not required.   You are just willfully lying to yourself as well.  </TEXT>

If I want to take a taxi from my home into the metro-downtown area about 25 miles away, the price is over $100.   One way.    That's crazy expensive.    </TEXT>

Lots of people who are rightly disappointed that the mods there are now allowing racists to run roughshod over the subreddit now.  

It should be possible comment about what happened without calling for mass genocide of North African peoples.   Maybe some of them should try talking about it without direct appeals to hatred.    To call for indiscriminate murder of people who happen to be Muslim just because they are Muslim is to be no better than ISIS or other terrorists they claim to oppose.    </TEXT>

James Longstreet, when he was resigning his US Army post in Texas before joining the Confederate Army was asked how long he thought the coming war was going to last replied "At least three years, and if it holds out for five years you may begin to look for a dictator".  

Of course, he also said after the war when somebody asked him was the cause of the war war: "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".

<TEXT> And the the New York Manumission Society, which got slavery banned in New York State..... it was disbanded decades after it successfully got slavery banned in NY State, three years before the publication of *Uncle Tom's Cabin*.    For the record, UTC was published in 1852.   NY State banned new slavery in 1799 and all remaining slaves were freed in 1827.   And the NYMS was disband in 1849.     

Oh, and in 1799 there were already fewer than 3000 slaves in NY state anyway.   So, it was a long time fading institution there already.  

The whole idea that people didn't know slavery was wrong until after 1852 is just incredibly stupid.   I get that maybe it was some kind of half-life date for popular opinion around 50%+ of the population finally seeing it as a moral and social evil.   But there had been people working against slavery for centuries at that point.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing is, the tax issue is just the Slavery issue in disguise.   Because what is the tax on?    Goods that are created primarily via slave labor.  

All the alternative issues people try to bring up in relation to the Civil War are always, at the heart of the matter, the slavery issue at their core.  Take slavery away, and those alternate issues all evaporate away in a puff of smoke.  

Taxes... on goods produced by slave labor. 

Tariff issues, again.... on good produced by slave labor. 

States rights..... to own human beings as if they were farm animals. 

Straight up, there would have been no US Civil War if it wasn't for the problem of slavery.   Every issue that people bring up as possible alternate causes or contributing favors are themselves the slavery issue in disguise.   

It's one of those rare issues in history where the simple uncomplicated answer tells the full story.   Question: What's the cause the US Civil War?  Answer:  Slavery.    To give any other answer is to obfuscate the issue.

<TEXT> All the other reasons for the Civil War that you can come up with all lead back to Slavery.  

The Southern Agrarian Economy.... based on slavery.  

Tax issues.   Based on funds raised by working slaves on Southern Plantations.  

Trade issues.... around crops that were farmed by slave labor.  

States rights.... to own human beings as if they were farm animals.  

Not a one of those other issues does not lead directly back to slavery.    There is no other issue involved in the US Civil War.  It's 1all 100% of it about slavery.    Every other issue in relation to the causes of that war is actually the slavery issue in disguise.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> They believed in so much freedom that the one freedom that was totally and forever to be banned by the Confederate Constitution was that Slavery could never be banned.  The one and only state right that they were totally fighting for was itself to be limited from the very beginning.   Slavery was to be a forever pact of the Southern States that seceded.    Advocating for change on that front was to be banned forever and ever.  Plus a few more years.  They considered slavery so important that they really drove it home in their treasonous rewrite of the Constitution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's even a rather simple and straight forward thing to get unshadow-banned.  All one has to do is say to the admins "I'm sorry, I won't do that again.  Please give me a second chance".   Sure, the admins probably won't give them a 17th chance, but 2nd and 3rd chances are not unusual for the admins to grant.  

The problem with most of the people babbling about conspiracies are that they never think they go too far.   Since calling the parents of school shootings victims and accusing them of being actors doesn't cross a line for them.... that just means breaking a few the rules of Reddit isn't going to cause them any moral qualms in the least.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was able to find [this one](http://i.imgur.com/FNkGCM6.png), which is a bit tame.    I think when the admins shadow ban people, their messages often get removed.   Or maybe it's the report button that does that.  If you report a submission in a subreddit, it auto-hides.  So, the same may happen with PMs, but PMs don't appear in your [hidden items](/u//me/hidden/).   

But if you were an average user and got a hate-PM like out of the blue, one might panic a little.

<TEXT> I'm sure /u/ani625 is correct about people trying to dox the spam-submitter.   So, that would be why they were going through there history and deleting old comments and submissions.  

There is like a big formal letter write up that is being PM'ed to people who the conspiracy lunatics don't like.    It gives you like 72 hours to admit you are wrong everything, and then delete or kill yourself, or they will come after you, your family,  your employer, your next store neighbor, your siblings, and the clerk at your local mini-mart.   It's stupid but looks like a terrorist threat.  

I've reported these idiots to the admins several times.   And they admins shadow ban them.   But if somebody just did a simple spam-report and then got that write up, especially if they do not have any experience with these lunatics, it might scare them.    So, deleting their user history could make sense to them. 

Myself, I just don't scare easily.   Not after years of sparing with these idiots.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm steeling this write up from a great gentleman named /u/creesch.  

[Relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1357/)

*I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.*

---

Freedom of speech is a legal concept and a natural right of man that allows you to be free from persecution for espousing certain view points. 

The thing is though that freedom of speech and expression are not a absolutes. Even in the US there are laws that technically limit freedom of speech and expression:  Slander, libel, copyright, hate crimes, sedition and treachery for example.  

Then there are also other more basic rights that come before freedom of speech and expression and thereby limit them: the right to privacy, the right to have safety from violence, the right to fair trial. 

But that is all besides the point, reddit is a private company, so we venture into another area that a lot of people seem to misunderstand. On reddit free speech is often warped in this concept of "right to be listened to". While in reality the only thing it stand for is allowing you to be free from persecution for expressing certain viewpoints.

It does however not oblige other people to provide a platform for that speech. That is why schools can have and enforce rules against, for example, hate speech. So a school can discipline a student for distributing racial material but that same student can't be arrested by the government for distributing that same material. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing is, there are a lot of wackos out there selling *cures* for cancer.    It's a common get-rich scheme a lot of very unethical salesmen engage in.   This includes a lot of spammers on the internet too.    

People with cancer are easy targets because they think "if it works, it's worth it".   A lot of people with cancer and other terminal diseases, they're desperate, so a good number throw money at these scam artists.   I wish people would stop preying on cancer patients.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I banned him from four subreddits that don't allow racism of any kind.    Meaning under no circumstances.   Racist stormfront screeds, holocaust denial, homophobia, ethnic and religious hate speech, etc.  are not allowed in those subreddits.    Those subreddits ban people for that every day, and will continue to ban people for it.  

Those subreddits are actively moderated and do not allow racist bullshit.   It's the core what those subreddits are.   If you don't like, then you won't be welcome in those subreddits.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The opening of the Wikipedia article on [the Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) addresses this issue with this sentence.  

Some historians use a definition of the Holocaust that includes the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to approximately eleven million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany and German-occupied territories.

<TEXT> Einstein wrote some essays about the Nazis rise to power.   I guess in the late 1920s there were groups that would give series of talks about how Einstein was an evil Jewish scientist who was working to destroy German Science.   Einstein got interested a bit and went to a few of these talks and sat in the back and listen to their crazy rants.   From what I recall, he said they never recognized him.    </TEXT>

* Advertise it via places like /r/newsubreddits and via a nicely worded one-time self-posts in related subreddits.   One-time means one-time.   If you do more than that, the mods of those subreddits may take offense and the users may start to think you are just being a jerk/spammer.   
* You can also politely ask other mod-teams to list you on their sidebar.  But sometimes they will say no.   Be gracious when they decline your request.  If they think your a jerk, then they may block you entirely. 
* Ask some users who you see submitting similar content elsewhere to also submit to your subreddit.   If you like them a lot, maybe ask them to be a mod.  

And continue to submit content to it. This is the most important thing.   The more stuff you submit, the more people may take notice of it.   If there is no new content, then even if somebody discovers it months later, they won't come back again.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two different types of mod-removal actions.   They are called "Spam" and "Remove".    Your comment [looks like this](http://imgur.com/ADoQdfa) too me.   Submissions have the same removal options. 

If I click spam, it removes the comment and the spam filter learns that a moderator dislikes you and remembers that bit of info for future reference.     If I click remove, it just removes your comment but doesn't remember it for future reference.  

As to what the spam filter learns in these *spam* cases, is open to question.   Does it key on your username? Or that I removed a comment with the phrase "shed some light on it"?   Not sure if it learns either of those things, both, or something else entirely.   From observations I have made, I think it's the third option. But even that's just a bit of a educated hypothesis.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Defeating Link redirectors is old hat.  The admins have blacked holed more than a few of them via the soft and hard domain ban lists they manage.

The standard subreddit settings wiki-settings [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/h1SMc16.png), which says "Only mods, approved wiki contributors, or those on a page's edit list may edit", which is three separate classes.  If the second and third meant the same thing, I don't think they would both be mentioned.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it's possible to give a wiki-page in your sureddit different permissions than you default permissions.    [See this image](http://i.imgur.com/LhlhuPk.png). 

Change the permissions on your page.   Just give some specific mods the rights to "only approved wiki contributors for this page may edit", and don't add any.   Mods will still be able to edit it, and since there is no one else on the access list for that specific page, regular subreddit approved submitters won't be able to edit it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What if I want to used "Rule #6" for the list in the mod log, and drop a mod comment that says "I'm sorry, but we don't allow [insert domain name here] in /r/example_subreddit".    

Rule #6 is meaningless to the user, and the later is too long for the mod log. 

Also, sometimes mods don't want to tell the user it was removed at all.  As often we block domains that we view as always spam in all situations.   Since, by definition in this example, the  submitter is a spammer, we don't want to notify them that Automod had stopped them.   Sure, it's easy for people to figure it out if they know what to look for, but most spammers never actually bother to check.     So, if I don't want to communicate the information, I shouldn't be forced to communicate the information.

<TEXT> I still have some down vote bots that follow me around from events from years ago.   Know this:  The bots votes look like the register, but they don't.  The admins have probably already shadow banned the bot.  The bot doesn't know that it's been caught and stopped.   

I've discussed this topic with the admins, and they have a lot of counter measures in place when it comes to things like down vote bots.  

Contacting The [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) to let them know might be helpful for your peace of mind.  But as I already said, I'm sure they have already neutralized the idiot down voting you. </TEXT>

The greater context is important.   

For example, the 1952 and 1953 events with the Iranian Coup and Counter Coup are very complex.   Prime Minister Mosaddegh and the Shah were both going at each other hard.   Stalin has only very recently passed away.   Soviet Troops had occupied Northern Iran during WWII and had only pulled out a few years previously.   Also, even good histories often leave out that Ayatollah Khomeini supported the Shah in his show down with Mosaddegh.    

Same problems with the later information about Iraq.   

These are not unimportant details.   The blogspam glosses over all that.  Dare I say the author of it didn't even know about any of these details.    It's a shit piece and it's removed.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, real users should notice when they are shadow banned.   Then they can message the admins and be told what they did wrong.   I know this works because I was shadow banned for a short time once.   I asked the admins, they told me what I did wrong and asked me to not repeat the mistake.   I made the promise and they unbanned me.  

I've known other users who were shadow banned and then restored.   This is not hard.   It was all rather simply.  

And Reddit is not the only  site that does shadow bans or some nature.   Some sites call them quiet bans.  Others call them shadow bans.  It's the norm for the internet.

<TEXT> That would be interesting.  

I have not talked to the other mods of /r/History, but I think we might be willing to voltmeter allowing other subreddits to import the use of our anti-racist/anti-nazi rules.   We have previously made some of the rules available in places like /r/Modtalk or /r/Defaultmods, but we have several more than what we have already shown.   

Myself, but especially /u/Creesch and /u/Cordis_Melum, and others, have developed some very good rules that stop most racists, Nazis, stormfronters, homophobes, ethnic and religious haters, and other associated lunatics and crazies, from having free reign of /r/History's comment section.  

So, if you need people willing to help you with stuff like that, please let us know.

As to the German Rocket Scientists, when they were captured by the Allies at the end of the war, they were amazed at being asked all the questions about rockets by the Americans.  Finally asking their American handlers why would the Americans need German Rocket scientists, when it was American Robert Goddard's work they were building on.

People straight up don't pay attention to those, nor to the sidebar.    And they don't look at the content already present before hand either.   

People think "I need help with something" and then they can't think of a subreddit is should be submitted too, so they type in "help" as the name of the subreddit.   

When the mods find these inappropriate submissions, we remove them.   Normally we give suggestions about where the submission would find a better home too.   Sometimes they are so crazy that we're even at a loss for where they should go.   Where were thinking "why would you even post  that on the internet?"

If you see a submission that shouldn't be here, please report it or [message the mod-team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhelp).    We'll remove it then.

<TEXT> Hosts files are an an old way, from pre-DNS days, that computers did IP lookups.  

I'm going to assume your running Windows on your machine.  The hosts file is probably located at:

* %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Which is probably C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts for you.  

If there is an entry for reddit.com in that file, then your system is going to always assume is reddit.com is that IP address, no matter what DNS thinks.    Now a days, the host file is usually used to assign things to localhost so that your system doesn't try to visit them.  This can be used as a way to prevent a system from visiting potentially harmful sites.   They are also something that somebody can use to block users from visiting web sites for other reasons, because most regular users don't know about it's existence.   </TEXT>

I know Luster and TheRedditPope and mod with them at places.  They are good mods and good people.  I also know noeatnosleep and mod with him as well.   He is also a fine moderator and a good person. 

I don't like seeing all the people condemning Luster and Pope when I am sure there is more to this drama.

<TEXT> Lets just remember, more than half the Senate (then) Democrats who voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Bill, by 1976 were registered Republicans.   The Republican Party welcomed the likes of Strom Thurmond and a bunch of the others with open arms.   To the point that you guys were celebrating their careers and saying Thurmond should have been elected President in 1948....  because he was against the anti-Lynching law.  He was out and out 100% openly pro-murder and the Republicans welcomed him into their party. 

Also, the 1964 Republican Nominee for President (Barry Goldwater) and the 1964 Republican Party Platform was anti-Civil Rights.  

Anyone who was welcomed into the Republican Party, who retired from politics as a Republican, should be counted as a Republican in those statistics.  You are just using Statistics to lie to people about Reality.  

The Democrats threw those jack asses out of the Democratic Party.  The Republicans welcomed them and celebrated them.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Karma is also rather easy to get.   All you need to do is submit a few things on occasion.     This morning I submitted about 10-15 news stories about various topics.    I read the news each morning, and when I found things I thought were a little interesting, I submitted them to /r/News, /r/Politics, /r/Worldnews and a few other subreddits.   

If news isn't your think,   /r/Funny, /r/Pics, /r/AdviceAnimals and the SFW-porn subreddits exist for most images, among several other subreddits.  

Offbeat weird internet things can submitted to /r/WTF, /r/nottheonion, /r/Offbeat, /r/NewsoftheStupid and /r/NewsoftheWeird.  

Those are just  three categories out of the whole of Reddit.   There are 49+2 [default subreddits](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/05/whats-that-lassie-old-defaults-fell.html) out there, plus a lot of sizable non-default subreddits.  The [100-largest subreddits](http://redditmetrics.com/top) are all 300K+ users now.  And there currently are 362 subreddits with more than 100K subscribers.  

There is something out there for everyone.   People just need to check it out and submit to those subreddit-communities that interest them.   If they do that, karma will come to them.

<TEXT> From [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_why_am_i_being_told_.22you.27re_doing_that_too_much....22) in the /r/Help FAQ:

Karma is stored (internally) on a per-subreddit basis; if you are new to a subreddit, you'll have to be patient. The delay will decrease as your karma in that subreddit increases and it only takes a fairly small amount of positive karma before the timer will turn off. This applies to both posts and comments. You can also get the timer turned back on if you make a lot of negatively voted posts/comments.

So, yes.... it is in there.   </TEXT>

It's removed now.  

Thank you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If that's happening, I would suspect that you have some browser add-ons that are doing something you don't expect them to do. 

For the moment, I would suggest you open parent permalinks via new-tabs rather than just clicking them. 

Not sure what else is going on, sorry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but no.   Only the submitter can edit it. 

That said, many subreddits create a shared-mod account that they often use for posting mod-announcements.   Anyone who knows the password can log into it and use it, including to edit the older mod-announcements.   In most cases, these kind of shared accounts are used specifically for this ability.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been that way for 9+ years.   For all that time there have been some people who complain about it.  It's left in place because there isn't a better solution for the issue in many cases.   A bad solution that works 90% of the time is better than no-solution that doesn't stop any spam.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of two issues is at play. 

* The mods of that subreddit need to approve it.   You would need to write to them to find out if they are willing to approve it.   
* You may be shadow banned on your (other, I assume) account.  In that case, the admins are the only people who can help you.  The number one reason get shadow banned is for spamming.   You might want to read the following rules of Reddit:
 * [Reddit Rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/)
 * [Spam Rules](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)
 * [Self Promotion Rules](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion)

<TEXT> If the government wanted to make sure nothing from /r/conspiracy made the front page of Reddit.com, I think calling up the admins and saying "We will give you $20 million to make sure /r/conspiracy never makes the front page".    If you are going to live in a conspiracy-world, that's so much easier than anything else.   

And if I was an admin, I would take that deal because nothing of value would be lost.   </TEXT>
