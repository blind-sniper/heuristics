<TEXT> Shuns paring knife is very highly rated among pro chefs,good choice.For a chef knife however i would suggest something like this for someone new to Japanese knives http://www.chefknivestogo.com/fu18gy.html . This will save you some  money and hold an edge better than a German knife while being less prone to chipping or tip breaking while you get used to the thin blade and steep edge bevels of these knives. Use the Germans as the work -horses and the gyuto for things like slicing and dicing softer veggies and boneless meats. Warning: the first time you slice a ripe tomato and don't see any juice on your board, you may fall in love with these knives. One last thing,learn how to strop,you won't be sorry.

<TEXT> Not to much actually, the big one was $35 and the little one was around $80. To be honest I haven't done any serious sharpening with these,I just play around stropping on them for edge upkeep and they do fine with that although the course one won't cut the super steels very well,(vg10,R2). I guess the trick to nats is to keep the slurry washed off until you get the edge and and then let it build up and thicken as you keep working with less and less pressure, that way one stone is multi grit. One day i will find the patience to try this. For actual sharpening I have a couple Shapton bench stones and an edge- pro, easy peasy quick and easy. Got the nats from CKTG and at those prices I'm sure they are not top of the line,but it's a start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Correct on all counts. Stones are J-nats that I got from CKTG. Naturals are usually hideously expensive but these two plus the nagura came to just over $100,not bad. The large one is low grit and the small one is a very hard high grit finisher. I figured that if I'm going to learn free hand sharpening I might as well start the old fashioned way. </TEXT>

Took it to work today and while it's no laser,and I,m no expert, I sure perked it up. Enjoy! </TEXT>

I actually chose this one because of the recommendation you gave Fujiwara on one of my previous posts.I wanted to try a patina on a carbon knife I could use at work,but didn't want to screw up an expensive knife.

<TEXT> I have spent my whole life cooking on this concept.Never went to school and was lucky to train under some old school Euro chefs. My food doesn't win awards, but when the contest is over the chefs and judges come to me for their meal. I have asked friends many times, What are the best fundamental dishes of your life? Invariably, their response goes back to food prepared by a mother, a grandmother, a father, an aunt, or some other relative or friend. A main ingredient of those preparations is the love with which they are prepared. Those early tastes remain with you for the rest of your life. I stole that quote from the article but it is true,and I have made a good living on this concept. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Complicated but here goes...Corupt politicians,Wall street and large corps. basicly drove the local manufacturers out of buisiness.Ocar Meyer, Amour, Bush, Bud, Miller are a few culprits I can pull off the top of my head.They all got tax breaks, excused from quality control,got around labor laws,had excessive requirements  pushed into law that small companies could not afford and the regulators of these laws actually work for these corps.The result was that all the local manufacturing was devasted,the plants were closed and the respected brand names sold off to the corps.. Now with so many people hurting what should we do? Why we start importing tons of second rate shit and add that to our rat infested diseased food products that are made by under paid imported labor,then we open a super store! Why would anyone shop there? Because we spend all the money we saved on quality and labor and spend it all on media adds telling people they are stupid if they pay more and they will be much happier if they save save save! and of course out of work people do need to save.Sorry rambeling here,I just get so pissed. And now I must give credit where credit is due: The man who founded Walmart recognized the needs of the community and workers and Walmarts original plan was to treat the workers very well,which they did .When they opened a dist. center up here in NY back in the 90's they offered great pay and great benefits and I knew alot of people who left their job to go there.Unfortunatley the founder died soon after and the first thing to go was the benefits,then the pay, then the time worked so you could get unemployment when they laid you off for the slow season. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, I'm not a great fisherman but I do know some things.If you want big ass lake trout you need to find a COLD lake that is very deep. Rainbows and browns can be found in streams and creeks with cold runoff,look for deep holes in the bed or undercut banks. Small mouth bass like cold water and stone bottoms with good current ,same like trout they like cover. Large mouth bass,oh yhea the big boys,like warm water and lots of cover,think lilly pads. The south has the biggest.Pan fish: blue gills, crappy,sun-fish. Pretty easy but if you find some clear water and can see a cleared off circle on the bottom that is their nest and just a hook will do to entice them into attacking.Cat fish like warm rivers or at least a current and are bottom feeders. Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in the 80's my girl and I needed to get out of the coke scene and got a guy to back us as vendors on the Dead tour,no shit! Did pretty good selling beer and french toast off a coleman grill. Ran out of money in Boston and caught a ride down south with a Hells Angel.Car broke down in Maryland and stayed there 2 years working on a camp ground and bought a camper to live in and a car.Got sick of that and loaded everything including my new dog Willy into the car and headed to Fla. with $200 .Got there and set up on a camp ground and had a hard stretch to find work but made it,first into a trailer then  rented a decent house.Back up here since 91 and still with my girl,those were the best years of my life.If you have a job skill and and a set of balls, tits  whatever I say go for it,you might surprise yourself. </TEXT>

He had a good heart but my thrice cursed manipulating mother convinced him that a mans worth is only to be a plow horse for a woman. He took out three insurance policies and killed himself just shy of 40yo.My family celebrated that because the wife n kids got a million. I still hate  that I didn't do more to reach out to him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I am of the same opinion.Just to be clear,I was not looking for advice on what knife to buy for my one and only,just input on this kind of knife/steel from people who actually use them day to day.I have been cooking and collecting knives for decades and if there is one thing I've learned it's that there is no one knife to rule them all.I kind of just "Buy em and try em". The FKMs look real nice  and Mark Richmond gives them a great review,I will make it a point to try one. One question, in the reviews it says they have a 70/30 grind how does this affect sharpening? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, benchmade uses FRN on some of their knives. I have a buck with G10 scales  that can't hold a candle to the Vulcan. i don't know what a power lock is, but the Vulcan has an arc lock which is basicly the same as what benchmade has. What makes Benchmade so much higher quality other than the name? Forget the fan-boy stuff,you are only limiting yourself on what knives you use and enjoy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yhea,alot of fan boy type nonsense over there. So far I'm very happy with the Richmond.Mine is a 240mm extra tall in AEB-L steel,factory edge shaved hair but dragged a bit when I tried chopping instead of my usual rocking,a few strokes on a ceramic stick did the trick.I do plan on dressing this up with some stones and strops and expect it will take a pretty sick edge that can be maintained with a strop.Handle could be a bit fatter for my taste but not really an issue with a pinch grip.One thing that really impressed me was the nice edge rounding on the spine and below the handle,you rarely see this on a sub $100 dollar knife.Bottom line,I'm happy with this knife,but the saga continues and looking at the second tab I have open,I simply must have one of those sweet looking Northwoods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha HA! Thank you for your interest. Yes this is a different photo from the one you saw,I posted this one to FB for some freinds. One knife I use all the time at work is a (GASP!) Guy Fieri knife,a tiny step up from the white handle crap you find  in any kitchen, but the ergonomics of it are great,I love the handle, it doesn't hold an edge well, but I can give it a good edge in a hurry off the back of a plate or a steel,nothing wrong with that, and it looks good to the custumers when they they walk through my kitchen to use the bathroom.I work in a tiny and very busy diner so this is importent. The bottom two in my pic Are what I use the most when we are rocking,these sit on my sandwich board and  chop/slice onions peppers shrooms ect.. on the fly.
I like to give them fresh. I also use a Richmond Artifex for prep before we open.The top knife  is a Masakagi  and it will never see the diner,that one is a piece of art. I carry med stuff because I've had to wrap up too many kids with paper towels or whatever.Thank you again,it was good to get an intelligent response to one of my posts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really use recipes or measure much but here goes,adjust amounts acording to how much you are making.Brown 2#of sausage links or rope and set aside(brown over charcoal if you want to go the extra mile!).Julienne 1/2 large onion and 2 large green peppers,chop 2 or 3 cloves garlic.Pour 2 cans stewed or plum tomatoes into a bowl and crush with your hand,(I prefer stewed).Saute' onions garlic and 1/3 of the peppers until nice and brown,deglaze the pan with beer,wine,water,whatever,cook of excess liquid and add tomatoes.Chunk up the sausage and add that.Simmer for 2 hours then add Italian spice to taste(I like a little cayanne for some back bite),and the remaining peppers.Simmer 1  more hour or so. Can be served over pasta or eaten on rolls. Hope this helps, thanks for the interest! </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are all $100 range and very nice. Richmond Artifex 240mm, Shun Sora 200mm and Kanetsugu Pro M 210mm. These are thin, (about 2mm) laser class blades with nice comfortable handles and good steel.The Shun had the best factory edge but after dressing them up on some stones they are about equal. One note, the Shun has a VG-10 edge and it is brittle, if you drop it it can break the tip.The other two are a high carbon moly stainless with the Pro M being sub zero quenched. Several months use with all three, and I can say I'm happy with all of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in the 70's there was a helmet law protest in my home town, about 5,000 bikes showed up for this ride to the capital sans helmets. After some speeches and political stuff everyone went on a ten mile jam down the highway to a state park to party. Oh my God,kegs every where,naked people running around and general debauchery! There were several different clubs there and soon there were drag races going on the road and everyone was loving it. After a few runs the H A organized it and had guys directing traffic, flagging the racers and timing them.Then the city police showed up,guess what? They took over traffic control and let the races go on! Best day ever untill some asshole threw a bottle at a cop car and it all ended in a cluster fuck. </TEXT>

Guy fieri knife I use as a beater,I can throw it around, drop it whatever, doesn't chip or break and the shit steel will take an edge off the back of a plate or a steel.Bottom is an 8" Shun Sora that cuts like a laser. I use this on station while doing orders. Don't really need tongs,spoon,ect...as I gave up saute and night shifts years ago. I'm a chef in a small diner and my work is mostly soups ,stews and specials. First aid stuff because every kitchen should have that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been looking for a knife with very specific characteristics for a long time.First and foremost,it had to chop,slice and do tip-work all equally well.secondly,it had to be light, nimble and easy to use on the fly in a fast short-order kitchen on the 2'/10" cutting board of my sandwich bar. last but not least,it had to be under $100 and not so fancy that I would cringe to beat it up. I'm an old school chef and don't believe in cutting up tons of stuff ahead of time.I use a heavier, taller gyuto knife to make my soups and specials in the AM,then go to this as I do orders.I tried so many of my knives for this and it was always a trade off,a tad long or short, good sweet spot for chopping but no good for tip work,nice tip and belly but no chop spot.Ran across this by chance and I love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have collected knives and also used them to make a living my entire life,I'm no expert but here's my take:You can drive yourself crazy with edge theory,or any other theory for that matter.If an edge works for you it's good,period. Unless you are a world class wood carver or an internationaly acclaimed sushi chef,you don't need to inspect your blade with a microscope.I hear the same arguments about theory on ham radio,I am talking to a guy in Russia while another guy here in the US is telling me why my antenna wont work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love that little Nieto picnic knife,comes mostly sharp,could be better. A few imperfections such as a buffer burn on the corner of one scale, and in my case a tiny nick in the edge of the main blade.Not a deal breaker for me as I can easily correct that when I get to it.Build is very tight and right,both blades walk well and have a good snap.Overall I'm happy with this knife and would buy from this maker in the future </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you on your comment on entry level chef knives, but would like to point out that this kid says he knows nothing about knives. A Victrorinox is good in this case,if I had a Tojiro or a Masakage back in the 70's my nickname would be Stubby and my knives would be rusted.I would advise a beginner to start mid-range and work up from there if they feel comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I agree with with Weebus that you can get sharper and better performing knives for the same or a little less money than Shuns,I wouldn't say they are vastly over-priced.It depends on what you want.Shuns are marketed toward the home user and you are paying for the look and fit and finish as well as the blade,I have a set of 6 so far and they,re all flawless and better than most crap out there. I also have a Masakage blue steel2 gyuto that puts them to shame edge-wise,same price as my biggest Shun much better blade but not as pretty and needs more care.Want a fast car that will impress people? buy an Aston-Marton.Want to go faster than every one? Buy an old model A with a 454 big block.Want to slice frozen Turkey? look here http://www.husqvarna.com/us/forest/products/xp-saws/346-xp-e-tech-triobrake/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for adressing my question. I was not looking for a "polished vs rough edge" debate when I made this post,just wondering if anyone has tried a different grit on each side of the edge to improve a cheap knife that will not cut or hold an edge as well as a nice knife.I have some very nice polished knives and they would fit my needs,but I will not use them at my "battle station" nor will I take the time to treat my beater as a high end blade.Once again,thank you for your input. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes it can,but a polished edge meant for chopping will not slice a ripe tomatoe as well as a rougher edge. I use my high end stuff early in the AM for prep, then when we open I throw my beater on the board and have at it. It is a cheap knife and I am looking for the best of both worids.I have made my living with knives for the past 30+ years.Am I doing something wrong? I don't think so </TEXT>

<TEXT> My beater knife must chop and slice equally well, plus take a major beating every day.I recently read a good article on the "toothey" vs polished debate and the author half  jokingly said  "A little toothey at the back ,and polish the rest".I thought Hmmmm?. Then I read that the guy who sharpens Masakage and other high end knives uses a different grit on each side of the blade. Has anyone tried this? any thoughts? Knife in question is a cheap German stainless blade,but a step up from the stuff from sysco ect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am inclined to agree with brightbrightfish. My grandpa came here from Germany in the 30's and while he loved his heritage he never bragged about it. He played harmonica and acordian,made willow crafts, was an acomplished wood worker in the old ways ect, but first and formost he was an American.  if anyone referred to him as a German he would let them know that he worked hard to get here and even harder to learn the language and pass the tests to become a citizen of the USA and he was proud of that.Whatever happened to that way of thinking? </TEXT>

I agree that racism is alive and well in this country, but when I see this kind of shit it makes my heart sink. If you really care about the issue then adress it intelligently. BTW Zimmerman is some kind of Hispanic and the victem was black.These guys have seperate gangs that hate each other,no whitey involved. In the end it's the money that wins every time.

Had some good friends there and miss alot of things about it, the prices at Millers,take a drive to Hastings and pick up free taters along the road,my friends at the Clock,the river(Georgia sucks!)Palatka song writers,pig races at the fair,tales of the Bardin booger,The Oasis(I got freinds in low places) and so on.But my original post is true,not rumor and not the only story I could have told. It's just how some people were when I lived there.

<TEXT> I love my Shuns,great steel,great looks and no heel,I hate the heel.
The handles are also a joy. Would I use my Shuns at work in a super busy 20 seat tourist town diner? ARE YOU CRAZY?! They hang on the wall in their bamboo "Shrine" and I use them for special dishes. I also love my original Pure Komachi set,cheap but very sharp and look nice.
I use these daily at home for light duty stuff. My home beater is an old high carbon forged that I had professionally reground. The point being,
buy what you like and don't listen to self professed experts,most of them are not experts.If you like it get more,If not,well now ya know.
I agree Vics are the best buy and always recomend them to my home use friends but they're not for me. "Far better than Shun for less"?
DON"T YOU BELIEVE IT! Those are German brands trying to imitate Shun. As far as the edge holding debate goes,serious Japanese chefs
sharpen their knives on a stone EVERY day. The knife I use at work?
 A gaudy tv personality signature knife that I bought on a whim and turned out to be perfect for what I need at work. Ha Ha! enjoy your Shuns! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Saw the origanal Lynyrd Skynyrd band back in the day at an amphitheater with a huge lawn for outdoor seating.Security in those days was just some rent-a-cops to keep people from jumping over the fence.this was THE biggest party I have ever been to, probably 16 to 18 thousand people,booze,all the illicit stuff,everyone just having a rowdy good time and Skynrd were spot-on kick-ass JAMMIN!
But wait...there's more! They played just about all their stuff except Free bird and Sweet home Alabama and said good-night,crowd is really nuts with encores, lighters,(remember that?) and rebel yells.
They come back on and do a short set and finish with Free bird then say good-night again.Crowd is now going nuts again and this goes on for about 1/2 an hour, the stage is dark and people are starting to get ready to leave.A loud voice from the darkness says, "What song is it you wanna hear?"and then,dun dun dada da dun dun dada,and the stage lights up like a Christmas tree.A confederate flag big enough to cover the entire back-stage drops and they launch into Sweet home.
I have never seen anything like it, it was raining beer cans, the screaming could drown out a jumbo-jet,just...nuts. One last thing, this was in upstate NY.

<TEXT> It,s already happening here in the US. A few years ago there was a drought and Georgia was theatening to go to war with Tennessee over a shared lake on the border.Meanwhile the Gator-aid plant in Georgia continued to use million of gallons of water every day. It is  illeagal to harvest rain water in Colorado. Ever see a picture of the fabulous fountains in Vegas? A few miles down stream people are starving because what once was a river is now a muddy trickle. Where I live, companies are lobbying for the right to drill for gas by pumping thousands of gallons of chemicals deep into the ground and for up to  a quarter mile or so laterally.In pennsylvania, where this has gone on for a while, people can light their well water on fire and whole towns have been ruined. The gas comany will supply them with trucked in water while they drill, but after they move on they are fucked. This is just in the US,it is 100 times worse in third world countries and the propblem is not the population, it is the corperations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good point, I too have noticed "bragging rights" syndrome.
It's usually about brands, but what really bugs me is the whole
"super steel" thing. There is no super steel,different steels are made
for different purposes, period. D2 is good for a camp knife while 
carbon steel is better for a butcher knife,VG10 holds an edge forever
but if you use it to chop wood or bone it chips and takes forever to sharpen. 440c is a good all around choice used by Buck and many
custom makers for years. If it's well made and works it's a good 
knife IMHO. </TEXT>

One day a guy came walking past with 2 big red dobies,Willy came
charging out snarling and growling like a fucking rabid badger rocket ship.The dobies go into fight mode and turn to meet his charge,
Willy does this ninja side step,rolls and comes up underneath them snapping at their bellys then out the other side to snap at their asses.
Poor bastard holding the leashes was trussed up good by this time and I'm sorry-ing like a Canadian as I gather up my little "stretch- lowrider"
and put him in the camper where he got a chewy and a well deserved
ATTABOY!

<TEXT> This kind of nonsense really pisses me off. The use of a cutting edge is the single most important development in the history of mankind.
You can survive without fire but you cannot survive without some sort of cutting edge.Every single thing that you eat, wear or use in this world   requires some sort of knife to produce. The first pocket knife used to be a rite of passage for a 10-12 year old boy,now they are taught that knives are scary terrorist weapons  that will not be tolerated.What is the result of this nonsense? I have young nephews that know I like knives and without fail, on some  X-mas or B-day I will recieve a big scary looking mall-ninja piece of shit.I use those to chop weeds out of the yard and shake my head in sadness.

<TEXT> When I was a kid in the early 70's we thought we were all cool with our CAT knives...they were junk. Turned me off to Mercator for a long Time. Looking back, they were probably  Japan imports which back then were junk. Today,Japan is the same Great Quality as the Made in the USA of yesteryear if not better.Try here http://www.worldknives.com/ I have had good luck with Linder, Nieto, and the French, Swiss and Russian companies. Anything from Seiki Japan is nice. Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the interest everyone. I bought this as a show piece and would not want to ruin that beautifull polish by taking it in the field.I have used it in my kitchen though and it is razor sharp and well balanced.Finger guards? we don't need no steenking finger guards,LOL! As far as legal limits go,cops do whatever cops want to do.When I'm about town I just carry a small folder in my pocket,(Kershaw scallion),don't see the need for more than that. </TEXT>

Small knife is an old hacksaw blade worked with a file and the handle whittled from a 100 year old maple that blew down in my yard.One hidden pin sawed from a drill bit and the bolster is cast like an old time knife but with epoxy and coal dust for color. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nieto picnic knife.This is a cool little (about 2" closed) knife.Olive wood scales and AN-58 blades and much decorative work.Fit and finish are not perfect(slight buffer burn on the corner of one scale) but very nice.Build is very tight and solid.Edge needs a bit of stropping to shave hair.Mine came with a very tiny nick in one side of the edge but I think it was just one of those things as the rest of the knife is so tightly built.Not a deal breaker for me.Custom made collector quality? No. Cool little piece of jewelery for about $40 bucks?Oh yeah! </TEXT>
