Nonetheless, this does present practical difficulties.

You're trolling a subreddit you moderate.  Pretending to spot bigotry, or is it homophobia? Then delete comments that you dont like. I have friends who are gay, but they dont wear it on their sleeve. Whatever happened to tolerance?  Youre a confused hypocrite. And are actually counter productive to your cause.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Often cited" by people who wish it to be true by virtue of repeating it, a common practice here on reddit.  But this has nothing necessarily to do with actual reality.  Though it isn't hard to believe that it sometimes occurs, study or not.

Another theory that isn't new is that some gay people wish to stigmatize those who don't like their behavior.  So they call anyone who doesn't support in-your-face flamboyance, for example, a homophobe, as if that is a scientifically established category - because it sounds like it might be.  Actually, *homo* means "the same" and *phobia* means "fear of":  Fear of the same.  This is the furthest thing from scientific rigorous thinking, which is supposed to be cool on reddit.

<TEXT> it's ok.  forgive me for being harsh.  it is just that with this subreddit, 9 out of 10 comments are, to paraphrase: "words don't matter, it is all about what *is*.  so if you stop using words, your question will magically disappear."  but the TTC states explicitly that the Tao has an essence which can be tested.  the TTC itself, in fact, uses words.  i would say that these commenters are immature in their experience of Taoism, and happen not to add to the value of the subreddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are using a lot of words to say that words don't matter much.  *I understand the the Tao is the way, things just are, words are convention, etc, etc, etc.*  The TTC and Chuang Tzu talk about all sort of things, directly and indirectly, but they never mention marriage or human family relations even in passing.  If your "explanations" held up, there would be *no* talk of any relationships of *any* type in these books, but instead, there is much talk of them; a ruler's relationship to the citizenry, for one.  Your adherence to supposed principle is keeping you from seeing what is right in front of you.  Not very Taoist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In several plays in the Final Four, I saw him make some really half-hearted effort.  He appeared to not *really* be trying, looked unmotivated.  They were plays that just a little more effort would have resulted in a score, but didn't.  This isn't good to see in a game of that importance for someone with his potential.  They are things one *never* sees in a star, and never wants to see in a potential draft pick.  I understand it is a small sample size, but if I were a GM that would still bother me.

<TEXT> Thanks for clarifying that.  Yes, I pretty much agree with your assessment of why he brings up the 5 colors/organs/sounds, etc.  Though to me it seems like he's not throwing the 5 elements/phases in with all the other groups of five.  He doesn't give them the same treatment.  The 5 elements/phases are left out of those discussions.  I was wondering if I was reading this correctly, and if there was a reason they weren't given the same treatment as the other groups of 5. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did cite the passages, but perhaps you're asking if I can quote them.  Here is Burton Watson's translation:

***
FROM CHAPTER 14:
The shaman Hsien beckoned and said, "Come - I will tell you. Heaven has the six directions and the **five constants**. When emperors and kings go along with these, there is good order; when they move contrary to these, there is disaster. With the instructions of the Nine Lo, order can be made to reign and virtue completed. The ruler will shine mirror-like over the earth below, and the world will bear him up. He may be called an August One on high."

FROM CHAPTER 12:
The hundred-year-old tree is hacked up to make bowls for the sacrificial wine, blue and yellow, with patterns on them, and the chips are thrown into the ditch. Compare the sacrificial bowls with the chips in the ditch and you will find them far apart in beauty and ugliness; yet they are alike in having lost their inborn nature. Robber Chih, Tseng, and Shih are far apart in deeds and righteousness, and yet they are the same in having lost their inborn nature. There are **five conditions** under which the inborn nature is lost. One: when the **five colors** confuse the eye and cause the eyesight to be unclear. Two: when the **five notes** confuse the ear and cause the hearing to be unclear. Three: when the **five odors** stimulate the nose and produce weariness and congestion in the forehead. Four: when the **five flavors** dull the mouth, causing the sense of taste to be impaired and lifeless. Five: when likes and dislikes unsettle the mind and cause the inborn nature to become volatile and flighty. These five are all a danger to life. And yet the followers of Yang Tzu and Mo Tzu go striding around, thinking they have really gotten hold of something. This is not what I call getting hold of something.

If what you have gotten has gotten you into trouble, then can you really be said to have gotten something? If so, then the pigeons and doves in their cage have also gotten hold of something. With likes and dislikes, sounds and colors you cripple what is on the inside; with leather caps and snipe-feathered bonnets, batons stuck in belts and sashes trailing, you cramp what is on the outside. The inside hemmed in by pickets and pegs, the outside heaped with wraps and swathes, and still you stand in this tangle of wraps and swathes and declare that you have gotten hold of something? If so, then the condemned men with their chained wrists and manacled fingers, the tiger and the leopard in their pens and prisons have also gotten hold of something! 
***

I looked up Wu Hsing [here](http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/taoism/yinyang.html) and [here](http://www.iep.utm.edu/wuxing/), and it is clear that the 5 colors, sounds, organs, etc., derive from the 5 elemental phases (constants).  I understand Chuang Tzu's method of exaggeration and humor, but that doesn't mean that the book can be reduced to a one-liner which shall not be discussed, or that everything that isn't clear can passed over as a joke.  The TTC states that the Tao has an essence that can be tested.  Asking a question for clarification is hardly "overthinking".

<TITLE> Question about 5 elements (Wu Hsing) vs. 5 colors </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-21 20:03:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In Chapter 14 of Chuang Tzu, in the first real paragraph, it mentions the 5 cardinal elements (fire, wood, earth, metal, water).  These are also known as Wu Hsing.  Elsewhere in the Chuang Tzu, the 5 colors and the 5 smells, etc., are mentioned, as in the last paragraph of Chapter 12.

It seems to mention the 5 colors, in particular, as something to avoid.  That is, the names and limits of 5 colors trap our minds into assuming there *are* only 5 colors.  But does Taoism similarly suggest avoiding the 5 elements, for the same reasons?  Or is there a difference in how the Tao approaches the 5 elements vs. the 5 colors?  Am I wrong to assume there is any similarity in the treatment by Taoism of the 5 colors and the 5 elements?

Any clarification or explanation you can provide would be most helpful.  Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm all for challenging force of whatever type, whether it is corporations, governments, anything.  Democracy is just herd mentality though, and rule by majority.  Nothing inherently good or just about that, just that when it comes to the (unually inevitable) conflict, they already have a majority in support of it.  I say, if the majority wants something, they should do it themselves as individuals, because they believe it should be done - instead of waiting for it to come up on the ballot and vote for it.

But back to my other comment:  Free markets, per se, don't lead to abuses and corruption, like we've seen on Wall St. recently.  The banksters make the laws and are enabled by DC to do these things.  DC and Wall St, the government and the banksters/corporations, work hand in hand to screw us all.  Enforce the law, enforce contracts, punish crime and criminals, for a start.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right.  But one side wants to use force to take money.  The other wants to let people keep what is theirs, and says coercion is wrong, illegal, a problem, counter-productive, etc.  The former says they don't care who disagrees with them, it is imperative to take money from people.  The latter says lets agree to disagree, disagreement is to be expected (and probably valued), just don't hurt me or take my stuff.

<TEXT> Oh fuck you.  No one is talking about a "presumption of innocence".  I'm talking about simply being able to fire someone, cops in this case.  Anyone in most non-government jobs can be fired, sometimes for inconsequential things.  People have recourse in courts if they want to pursue it.  People get fired all the time without their "lives being damaged".  Cops do things all the time that warrant firing, but they don't get fired because they have these protections.  Respond with substance or shut the fuck up and go away.   </TEXT>

Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yaeD-E_MY) and tell us you're not sure if the murder was justified.  

Why should police be protected any more than any other line of work?  If your boss thinks you did something stupid at work, he can fire you, without giving you paid leave until further investigation is complete.  You can pursue it in court if you want.  Cops can pursue it in court if they think they were wrongfully terminated too.  Plus, there is a difference between not following police procedure, police abuse, killing someone, all kinds of gradients.  They could be fired for not following procedure and the court could still find them innocent.  You are saying that cops should be paid unless and until the court finds them guilty.  Why the fuck is that?

<TEXT> Paid leave could be said to be corruption itself.  Plus, there is corruption and cover-up all over the place in these police departments anyway.  Further, it's not obvious how it would deter corruption.  

[Look at this](http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=police) if you think police don't get paid that much.

What if they did something heinous, but the court found them not guilty?  OJ Simpson style?  Still give them paid leave and let them keep their jobs?

Watch the Kelly Thomas [murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yaeD-E_MY) and tell us you aren't sure whether the cops should be fired. </TEXT>

But should a police department *not* fire an officer for proven abuses?  The extreme, but all too common, example is when police have video evidence of officers killing a guy for no reason.  These guys should be fired, period.  Whatever the court determines is another matter.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Comes to light" usually means when then public finds out about it, even though fellow officers already knew.  

And the problem is that these officers are put on *PAID* administrative leave until the procedures run their course.  They should be able to be fired on the spot, and certainly not be *rewarded* with paid time off.  Police unions are the big cause of much of the police abuse problems today.  They defend and protect and enable it.  Cops should have to pay their own legal fees like anybody else.  The unions don't want any accountability.   </TEXT>

Competitive, jealous, controlling, domineering, crude/brash, ends justify means, insecure, inconsiderate, unthoughtful, impersonal, no taste.

EDIT:  Oh yeah, they lose their temper.  As much as they like to control others, you'd think they could control themselves....

<TEXT> After the game, Kerr himself compared Curry to Jordan and Duncan, saying that he's seen those guys have games like that too.  To claim that the media just holds Lebron to a higher standard is a joke.  

Generally, the media can't be expected to report fairly on any of this.  They are fans and biased and irrational like the rest of us.  Though, as such, they shouldn't pretend to be otherwise - like they do.  

We're probably holding the media to too high a standard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ONLY non-canonic book you need is "Tao: The Watercourse Way", by Alan Watts. It is probably the simplest, clearest, most thorough book on the subject. Watts is an excellent communicator. But get The "Tao Te Ching" and "The Book of Chuang Tzu" also, of course. I think the Penguin versions/translations are best. 

For Zen, I would get Watts' "The Way of Zen", which has a very good chpater on Taoism.  And/or this book by DT Suzuki: http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Buddhism-Selected-Writings-Suzuki/dp/038548349X

Look at Great Britain, and Rome before them.  Empires don't last because of amoral short-sighted, greedy mentality.  You can cheer for it all you want, but don't pretend it is founded on anything substantive, and certainly not on anything good.  Call it what it is:  Might makes right. </TEXT>

You're thinking for the short-term, not the long term.  And you're thinking for a limited category of people, the warmongers and banksters.  If you recalibrate for the long term for all citizens, your assertion is bogus.

<TEXT> Read [this](http://freedom-school.com/money/how-an-economy-grows.pdf).  Some of the most fundamental things anyone could ever learn about money and economy.

Money has nothing to do with productivity, and really doesn't have anything to do with survival.  Also, people could create their own jobs.  They shouldn't have to depend on the government or someone else to do it.  Yes, in many ways the powers that be have turned the Western world into a debt-slave culture and a dependent economy and have made it harder to get by:  predatory lending, bubbles one to the next, discouraging savings, etc.  But they have made the problem, and can't be looked to for a solution.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> "Cannery Row" by John Steinbeck, Chapter 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-19 22:49:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The word is a symbol and a delight which sucks up men and scenes, trees, plants, factories, and Pekinese. Then the Thing becomes the Word and back to Thing again, but warped and woven into a fantastic pattern. The Word sucks up Cannery Row, digests it and spews it out, and the Row has taken the shimmer of the green world and the sky-reflecting seas. Lee Chong is more than a Chinese grocer. He must be. Perhaps he is evil balanced and held suspended by goodan Asiatic planet held to its orbit by the pull of Lao Tze and held away from Lao Tze by the centrifugality of abacus and cash registerLee Chong suspended, spinning, whirling among groceries and ghosts. A hard man with a can of beansa soft man with the bones of his grandfather. For Lee Chong dug into the grave on China Point and found the yellow bones, the skull with grey ropy hair still sticking to it. And Lee carefully packed the bones, femurs, and tibias really straight, skull in the middle, with pelvis and clavicle surrounding it and ribs curving on either side. Then Lee Chong sent his boxed and brittle grandfather over the western sea to lie at last in ground made holy by his ancestors.
    
Mack and the boys, too, spinning in their orbits. They are the Virtues, the Graces, the Beauties of the hurried mangled craziness of Monterey and the cosmic Monterey where men in fear and hunger destroy their stomachs in the fight to secure certain food, where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them. Mack and the boys are the Beauties, the Virtues, the Graces. In the world ruled by tigers with ulcers, rutted by strictured bulls, scavenged by blind jackals, Mack and the boys dine delicately with the tigers, fondle the frantic heifers, and wrap up the crumbs to feed the sea-gulls of Cannery Row. What can it profit a man to gain the whole world and to come to his property with a gastric ulcer, a blown prostate, and bifocals? Mack and the boys avoid the trap, walk around the poison, step over the noose while a generation of trapped, poisoned, and trussed-up men scream at them and call them no-goods, come-to-bad-ends, blots-on-the-town, thieves, rascals, bums. Our Father who art in nature, who has given the gift of survival to the coyote, the common brown rat, the English sparrow, the house-fly and the moth, must have a great and overwhelming love for no-goods and blots-on-the-town and bums, and Mack and the boys. Virtues and graces and laziness and zest. Our Father who art in nature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a fan of Showtime in the 80's (up until the Kobe era), but not a fan of Magic anymore.  This comment was clearly directed at the Laker fans who can't handle the Clippers success.  What's he talking about?  *Everything* about the Clippers has changed in the last few years.  If they don't win a championship, they're "cursed"?  Trying to define these guys by their past is beyond disingenuous, and he knows it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is only the media echo chamber.  None of them could answer that question.  That said, I think he's a pretty good coach.  Though I couldn't say why.  He gets out of the way and lets the players play.  He's a "player's coach".  But these guys needed some serious coaching.  They rely on talent, and that goes a long way.  But when push comes to shove, and the pressure is on, when they are psyching out, or not doing what they can do, they need some serious coaching.  Because they just seize up.  For starters, he should tell Blake to just back it down to the hoop every time.  He only drew one foul in the second half, and shot 2 free throws.  It's great that he scores almost 30 every night, but he could have 50.  But there are so many other things....  Basically, what does Doc do when the heat is turned up and the pressure is on? </TEXT>

Matt Barnes /

Eric Bledsoe /
Caron Butler /
Jamal Crawford /
Willie Green /
Blake Griffin /
Grant Hill /
Ryan Hollins /
DeAndre Jordan /
Lamar Odom /
Chris Paul /
Ronny Turiaf /

Neil Olshey was the GM (now with Portland), and a good one.
But we also had Donald Sterling, and there has been a recovery period since he and Olshey left.  How did we lose a team with a the best bench in the league to get a team with one of the worst benches in the league?  We didn't play our cards right.

Ballmer, if you're reading this, please get us a good GM.  ASAP. </TEXT>

We have to sign players that don't have liabilities.  Except for DJ's free-throw shooting - that is about all we might be able to live with, especially if the NBA fixes that ridiculous rule in the off-season.  

Our prime search should be for a GM.  We had Olshey - now he's with the Blazers. </TEXT>

I fault Doc for not telling the team that when something is working, do more of it. Like get it to Blake inside. They cant guard him with one man. Seems like after a while Blake starts passing too much. 

We also stopped pushing the ball in the 4th quarter. Went to a hesitant half-court game. 

This team needs to be able to finish off games. Hopefully this was a wake-up call, and not the end of the season.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because I don't enjoy his prose enough to read that much of it.  So I'm not going to call him pretentious based on that, and certainly not in the same way as Cormac.  Yet, at least.  For whatever reason, I gave Cormac much more of a chance, or chances.

Cormac is all about himself, not his writings.  They're so bleak because that's the best he can do.  The bleakness doesn't have any merit on its own.  How many times is he going to use the same adjectives, like "thin"? 

Far back beyond the mountain a **thin** wire of lightning glowed briefly.
"The last **thin** paring of the old moon hung over the distant mountains to the west."
"He lay on his back in the gravel, the earth's core sucking his bones, a moment's giddy vertigo with this illusion of falling outward through blue and windy space, over the offside of the planet, hurtling through the high **thin** cirrus. 
"The man sat watching the road, the weed stem twirling in his mouth and the the reed **thin** shadow of it going long and short upon his face like a sundial's hand beneath a sun berserk."

....for starters.  Goddamn it's painful just to read that here.  Totally self-absorbed, and unnatural, and necessarily repetitive.

Just because *The Road* makes you long for the end of the world, doesn't mean Cormac is skilled at evoking an end-of-days kind of feeling.  His writing doesn't *evoke* bleakness, it is itself bleak.  There is a big difference, which most can't distinguish.

If Cormac wants to make a tour-de-force, he should focus on his writing and let it speak for itself, not use his writing as a vehicle to say "look at me!".  Great writers disappear.  Every time we see missing punctuation in Cormac's text, we're distracted and reminded that it's all supposed to point to him.  Many people so badly want to believe that they willingly fall for this trick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe beyond (hu)man(ity), to think of what it means without man  as it was for the great part of its long history, and as it is in the great majority of places. When this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of matter are appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to see life as part of the universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an experience which is rarely described. It usually ends in laughter, delight in the futility of trying to understand. These scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged simply as a stage for God to watch mans struggle for good and evil seems to be inadequate."  ~Richard Feynman </TEXT>

Christians have a lot of knee-jerk responses to this kind of thing that don't pass the slightest scrutiny.  They make declarations like it is sacred to be treated like an adult.  Who cares if you're treated like an adult if you have no way of seeing how he's treating you, hearing his voice, etc.?  Is the fact that he is so mysterious and so silent due to his desire to not be easy on us, to treat us like adults?  Whether he trivializes our existence or not is a ridiculous point and a trivial point.  Who cares if your existence is trivialized or not?  And actually, it is trivialized if you suffer and die within a half hour of birth - or a gazillion other examples.  Christians hang their hats on empty pronouncements like this.  Basically, it comes down to God says so, so it must be.  But any interrogation of it fails.  And their arguments are buttressed by their sheer emptiness and lack of relevance to anyone who hasn't already subscribed to their baseless points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A Taoist would reply that good and evil are necessarily unified.  You can't have one without the other, and they are one and the same (yin yang).  Yet he would also say that good-evil is only an artificial concept that is applied to nature, not intrinsic to nature itself.  As such, it is an illusion and a deception to the degree that we assume otherwise.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it is *very* analogous.  The parent-child analogy is perhaps the most relevant.  Parents simply don't let their kids have choices, because they know better than to let the kid jump in the pool, or take the car for a spin at age 8, or whatever.  They aren't given free will because their parents love them and want to protect them from themselves.  

On the other hand, Christians say, "How great it is that we have free will and God loves us enough to not make us robots or slaves.  But, darn it, too bad Adam and Eve ate the apple and ruined it for everyone.  But that's what happens when you have the ability to make your own choices."  A loving father would never treat his children the way God treats his children.  He wouldn't make himself mysterious, unheard, confusing, leaving them to fend for themselves so they can learn the hard way, suffer, etc.  

But further, *we don't have free will*.  You don't have free will without omnipotence.  It isn't free will if your choices are limited by someone else, and the results and consequences of those choices are determined by someone else.  It is not free will to be given the choice to eat the apple or not eat it, or else....  What if you don't want to be forced to make that choice and don't want those consequences?  

Heck, is faith even a choice?  Do you choose what you believe?  And if you choose what you believe, is it really a choice if the consequence of not believing is eternity in hell? </TEXT>

<TEXT> They developed this vaccine in response to the CIA trying to kill Castro with lung cancer.  He smoked cigars and this would allow the CIA plausible deniability.

Check out the story of Judyth Vary Baker.  She was recruited by the CIA to work on this cancer - the cancer, not the vaccine - secretly at the Roswell Cancer Institute and in New Orleans for Dr. Alton Ochsner (who was one of the first to connect smoking with lung cancer).  Baker developed a fast-acting cancer, testing it on mice, for the purpose of assassinating Castro.

In a related story, Jack Ruby (yes, the guy who killed Lee Harvey Oswald) died of lung cancer while in jail.  Toward the end of his life he was injected with large bore needles, and suspected they were giving him this cancer.  He was aware of the work going on in New Orleans.  Very soon after being injected, sure enough, he contracted lung cancer and died.  The CIA, et al, didn't want him to talk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Words are only tools and are abstract.  They aren't real (concrete) and aren't the things they represent.  The word "tree" doesn't help us understand trees.  Often words divide people even though they are used for communication.  We apply words and labels to ourselves and each other.  Maybe we call someone a Democrat, but that only limits - maybe prevents - our understanding of them as a person.  And it is using a word and category ready-made, handed down to us by the political system, which wants to divide people amongst themselves.  As just one example.

It seems in your second paragraph that you are making my point.  Why complicate it with more discussion and questions and words?  This will not help.  I'm not saying words or consciousness has anything to do with whether or not everything is one thing.  Everything is one thing *regardless* of words or concepts or consciousness.  We can talk about the complexities of language, but it will get us further from the point.  And that itself is my point.  A child doesn't know how to speak, hasn't yet learned the words.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow. I am actually writing a paper on Taoism. Was working on it today, and thought I remembered this piece on consciousness from Kierkegaard that might help. 

But knowing something about existentialism, I find its parallels with Taoism/Zen are quite poignant, though they aren't completely congruent. I want to investigate the connection more. Thanks for the lead.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As long as views and perspectives supply the meaning then you can probably find meaning of some sort here or there.  But views and perspectives come after reality itself.  Existence precedes essence.  Artificial rites of man might have meaning, but like everything, it is ultimately in the eye of the beholder.  To look at meaning as a pejorative thing is problematic.  Meaningful is, in itself, no better and no worse than meaningless.  

Trees don't mean anything.  Nature doesn't mean anything.  Meaning is artificial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Joey Crawford is totally out of control.  I appreciate zeal, but he loses the big picture.  It's not about you, Joey.  It's the playoffs - let them play.  The fans don't want everyone not playing.  His crew called a lot of fouls in the Clips-Spurs game they reffed.  But not nearly this many.

Then this was severely imbalanced in the Rocket's favor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> your art should not need a narrartive explanation to accompany it. it should not be conceptual to any degree. it should speak for itself. existence before essence. make something that just is. no clever one-liners. they are the opposite of existentialism.

<TEXT> Don't understand those coaching decisions down the stretch.  

1. Why take Blake out with 3 minutes left, even if you put him back in with 2 minutes left?  

2. Why have DJ sit so much the 4th quarter?  When DJ and Blake are both in there, they don't double Blake as much or as well, and DJ is a huge presence on defense.  Etc....

3. Why play Rivers so much?  We could have put Crawford, Reddick, and Barnes in there together.  They are all better shooters and better defenders than Rivers.

4. Why not intentionally foul Howard earlier in the possessions toward the end? </TEXT>

I am writing a paper on this, and other things right now.  It is quite timely to come across this post.  It is the flip side of the wu wei:  Natural order from within assumes a form that is determined from within, not from without.  I didn't know form was addressed explicitly in Taoist text this way though.  Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the subject of CP3 drawing fouls:

He can force contact and exaggerate it. But, unlike Parker and especially Ginobili, he doesn't sacrifice the whole play. Meaning he doesn't loose the ball. So if the foul isn't called, he keeps playing, usually without picking up his dribble. Ginobli will initiate contact as his first option, then do his gymnastics, flail, then flop, the ball missing the basket by a mile. I have no respect for that.  </TEXT>

Teams would be finishing close games all the time with one timeout left if they always had to save it just in case they couldn't get the ball in.  Plus, trust your team to throw an in-bounds pass. </TEXT>

For instance [this](http://deadspin.com/something-weird-is-going-on-with-randy-gregory-1701010088) and [this](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/04/29/confusing-reports-emerge-about-randy-gregory/).

King was against the war in Vietnam.  LBJ was for the war, as were war contractor buddies in Texas like George Brown, who helped start LBJ's political career.  Brown was one of the biggest war contractors of all time.

<TEXT> This is excellent.  The Bleacher Report may have a commitment to excellence.  

I'm going back and forth, and forth, on Williams/Cooper/White.  I tend to end on White or Cooper because we could then better realize Carr's potential.  But then they got Crabtree, so are they thinking this isn't as much of a need.  Then I remember Reg is a former LB, so maybe he prioritizes defense somehow.  

I want Williams *and* either Cooper or White.  Too bad we only get one.  I guess I'd be most happy if Reg saw it my way and got a receiver.  But if he didn't I'd be OK too maybe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly.  And it explains why anarchists/libertarians have trouble organizing (if we are to see that as "trouble").  Natural freedom entails what appears to be disagreement, but is only difference.  The words keep us apart, because we get fixated on them instead of human-heartedness.  To continue the example of politics:  Democrats and Republicans group themselves in opposition to each other based around artificial concepts, platform planks - pro-this, anti-that - which have nothing to do with real reality.  So they are in perpetual war for their own supposed benefit.  Gay marriage, for instance: Why is any kind of marriage anything more than an agreement between two people, or between two or howevermany whatever?  The powers that be have seized on this artificial issue to the detriment of us all. </TEXT>

And I can give you 8,000 ways in which SK was anti-Hegelian, and use primarily SK's own statements, not those of academics who enjoy the trees more than the forest.  You are aware of this.  Certainly you aren't suggesting that SK and Hegel are similar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hogwash.  Praise be to Almighty Science....er, peer review.  Ignorance of experts on full display here.  Why such zeal and dogma?  Where is your skepticism?  Why make a judgement call?  Why not hold global warming as a provisional possibility?  We haven't even gotten to whether it is caused by man or not.  If it is naturally occurring, apart of man, or not.  Or the question of if it is happening, in this giant universe, why the necessity for alarm as if we humans can do anything good to save ourselves.  All our saving of ourselves has only resulted in more wars, theft, etc.  I think it was a scientist who said if bugs go, life on the planet will have about 50 years, but if humans go, life on the planet will thrive.  So the enlightened are supposed to save us from ourselves?  So the tyrants who spout what they want to to justify taking our money for their own benefit are going to save us???  Get real.  

So at least you admit that consensus can be wrong.  You don't hear that from the rest though.  And even you say that if you have a "convergence of data", it is very unlikely to be wrong.  Oh the chances are slim.  I see.  Again you drift into non-science really fast.  If you guys are all talking about likelihood, then say so.  If this is a Pascal's wager thing, say so.  But none of you do.  You say it is happening, and anyone can see it, even though no one can see the data or interpret it properly, etc.  This is how you don't do your cause any service.  But you are the enlightened one, adored by academics and the tyrants.  Make a fucking prediction.  What's the temperature going to be in 10 years?  Al Gore should be able to put $1,000,000 on it.  I'm sure someone would take his bet.  But you can't even tell me the temperature next week.  But that's probably because I'm not a scientist.  

All the great scientists had skepticism and doubt and uncertainty, and were certain of their own ignorance, perceptions, etc.  They even doubted the fucking data.  NONE of the climate change zealots EVER express this.  They are religious extremists.

EDIT:  Nothing personal.  I don't want to be this harsh.  Forgive me.

<TEXT> Here are the [reading lists](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/graduate/master-s-liberal-arts/reading-lists/).

Henry Hazlitt - [Economics in One Lesson](https://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson)

Irwin Schiff - [How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn't](http://freedom-school.com/money/how-an-economy-grows.pdf)

[Fredric Bastiat collection](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/The%20Bastiat%20Collection_4.pdf)
Including "The Law", which you should read too.

Murrary Rothbard - [What Has Government Done to Our Money?](https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money) Maybe read this first.  Incredible book.

Ludwig von Mises - [Human Action](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Human%20Action_3.pdf)  The first books are short.  This one is long.

I don't know any good nutrition books.  Just wish I had learned it. 

Regarding philosophy:  I would start with the existentialists, and among them Soren Kierkegaard.  Because he was such an incredible philosopher, but also because his philosophy, and that of the rest of the existentialists, is so human.  It is not abstract, is not about concepts exclusively.  It will engage you and bring you in.  A lot of philosophy is difficult when initially confronted by a novice - but not always.  Also read the philosophy on the St. John's list.  Those are the basics.  Perhaps Plato and Aristotle most basic.

[Lao Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/014044131X) (Tao Te Ching) and [Chuang Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Chuang-Penguin-Classics/dp/014045537X) are the 2 basic Taoist texts.  Dating from 600-400 BC.  They are poetic and beyond words, literally and figuratively.  It would also provide a basis for other philosophy reading, though Taoism is not per se a philosophy or a religion.  Plus, it is eastern so it has a different angle.  Many parallels between Taoism and existentialism.  But read these alongside Alan Watts' ["Tao: The Watercourse Way"](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-The-Watercourse-Alan-Watts/dp/0394733118).  It might blow your mind.  Excellent stuff.  And not esoteric at all.

<TEXT> You need some training in basic epistemology.  It isn't a "hard science", but give it a try.  

The point with Galileo, which you probably get anyway, is that the *established consensus was wrong!*.  In your world, the "consensus" can't be wrong, and ignorance doesn't exist.  Let alone the questions of what a consensus is, who establishes it, etc.  You try to dismiss my example and say that they weren't scientists, that Galileo was the "first scientist".  What unscientific, purely rhetorical, nonsense!  "Considered by many" ?????  You and your ilk can keep parroting this considered-by-many delusion as fact in some way, but not only is it meaningless, it is misleading and *unscientific*.  

You argue against yourself when you say that no one but Galileo was a scientist in his time, so all the naysayers get a pass.  But nowadays you heap scorn on all the non-scientists if they don't take on faith what is supposedly established as consensus, though not 100% of course.  Because how are they supposed to process all that data and evidence, if it is so difficult for real scientists to do it?  Oh, by faith.  I see.  Now it's a religion.  Consensus becomes herd mentality.  Science is determined in the comments on reddit.  If I agree with you I understand how science works.  If I don't, I don't.  I'm afraid you don't understand how science works.  

If global warming is happening, you aren't making any good fucking argument for it.  You're making a pathetic, unintentionally unscientific argument not to listen to a goddamn word you say.  

One simple question for you:  Can the consensus be wrong? 

EDIT:  By the way, what's the consensus now?  Is it 90% or 95%?  Unlike with temperatures, the exact number is hard to determine.  Maybe we should just find out what the consensus on the consensus is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure most people would say SK is anti-Hegel.  And we would know what they mean. In some circles, where people fear being seen as too simple, perhaps they would elaborate. Usually not here on reddit though. 

Like with a lot of philosophy there are layers and there are indirect influences.  And there are contrarian books out there for everything. 

But to say SK was not anti-Hegel is the point that is untrue on its face, and only might be partially true with serious explanation, none that could be derived from what SK himself said, however.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Keys to the Game**

The Spurs defense is messing with our flow.  They are picking CP3 up at just across half court.  CP3 has to work to get around it just to the 3 point line to get the offense going, get a pass off, dribble anywhere.  And they give him different looks with Green and Leonard switching it up. It takes precious time off the shot clock if nothing else.  Hence, we haven't been rotating, cutting, moving, creating opportunities like usual.  When CP3 moves and passes, we are much better.  This should be obvious.

Blake can't be defended by any single Spur.  He needs to just dribble down to the post and shoot a bunny every time, or turn around and make a move.  He will either make a shot, get fouled, or pass to someone else open if he gets doubled.  But last night he didn't do this.  Heck, Splitter is playing him like a little bug.  

Barnes needs to cover Leonard like a blanket.  Don't help anyone else out.  Stay less than one arm's length from Leonard *at all times*.  Don't let him *receive* a pass.  Don't let him touch the ball.  It can be done.

Reddick and/or Barnes and/or Crawford need to be on.  When these guys all have an off night, or even 2 of them have an off night, we struggle big time.  

In the off-season we need to acquire a serious bench.  Hedo, Big Baby, and Spencer Hawes can barely even run.  They seriously look like they are in some geriatric condition, hobbling around everywhere.  And Baby shoots the most blockable shot in the world.  Hedo - at least he does no harm.  Remember when we had Eric Bledsoe, Caron Butler, Lamar Odom....? </TEXT>

<TEXT> We gotta finish close games off. 

We cant let their D stop and hold our offense. They we're picking us up just across half court and it would take another 8 seconds to start the offense. CP3 needs to get the ball to the three-point line quick and start moving around. 

If we run and push the ball it will work in our favor. 

We gotta make free throws down the stretch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Chuang Tzu is the best for these questions.  It addresses people as really human (human heartedness) and the questions of whether or how to improve things in the world.  It tells what the sage would do or not do.  Most of it comes down to wisdom and seeking harmony, not coercion, not impatience.

EDIT:  In other words, the answers like "What is there to improve?" don't *really* get it.  There is substance to Chuang Tzu's writings.  His book was longer than a reddit comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive been there. One thing I had to realize is that existence doesnt mean stasis. Things grow and change and learn. 

I would highly recommend checking out Taoism. Discovering it has done wonders for me. The two primary texts are The Tao Te Ching and The Book of Chuang Tzu. But also get The Watercourse Way by Alam Watts as a primer. Taoism shares much with existentialism, but not everything. It is not a religion or philosophy. Essentially, it is the way of nature. Becoming aware of it has helped me realize my place in the world, and helped rid me of existential angst, etc. Anyway, I cant do it justice here, but very strongly recommend it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the world of words, atheism is often, maybe always, the flip-side of theism. But what were we when we were born?  Beliefs and belief systems shouldn't be reduced to categories and concepts. Yes it makes them easier to argue and discuss, but also obscures their real nature, thereby making discussion about them less simple, and tends to make it about words. The discussion can be fun and can continue for its own sake, but we aren't really talking about the real nature of belief.  

We should take it to another level and incorporate this in the discussion, instead of remaining in the world of abstractions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know about Williams, but I'm not *unsold* on Cooper.  For this reason primarily:  Cooper would allow Carr to realize a far greater potential.  Carr has all this ability that is untapped because of the offense around him (and the play calling last year).  We would get more value from Cooper because there would be so much offensive synergy with Carr that we wouldn't get with Williams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> nothing has inherent value. not gold, not money, not architecture. also, there is a difference between architecture and building. but there are definitely different types of subjective value and potential subjective value. the investment in real estate is an investment in a real thing. whereas investment in something like education isnt quite as real. tangible is probably a better word than real. buildings are shelter. shelter is one of man's primary needs. therefore buildings have a value to man. but if there are too many buildings, they might be less valuable. but it is not inherent value. it is still subjective value that is given it by people.  </TEXT>

Charles Baudelaire - Elevation

Above the lakes, above the vales,
The mountains and the woods, the clouds, the seas,
Beyond the sun, beyond the ether,
Beyond the confines of the starry spheres,
My soul, you move with ease, 
And like a strong swimmer in rapture in the wave 
You wing your way blithely through boundless space 
With virile joy unspeakable.
Fly far, far away from this baneful miasma 
And purify yourself in the celestial air, 
Drink the ethereal fire of those limpid regions 
As you would the purest of heavenly nectars.
Beyond the vast sorrows and all the vexations
That weigh upon our lives and obscure our vision,
Happy is he who can with his vigorous wing
Soar up towards those fields luminous and serene,
He whose thoughts, like skylarks,
Toward the morning sky take flight
 Who hovers over life and understands with ease
The language of flowers and silent things! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  because I believe the Bible is inspired by God

Seems to be circular reasoning.  That you are a Christian because you believe, and vice versa.

What is the nature of God?  Does it/he have a nature or is it more of a concept?  If he has a nature and character, is it that described in the Bible?  If so, why is his love not really anything like that described?  That is, love should be immediate and demonstrable, not mysterious and conditional, especially the love of the great Father, God. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ....Unless you are a crack baby born to a prostitute and chained in a basement for decades.  

"God" isn't shorthand for "the cause", or the "unexplainable other" - at least as he describes himself in the Bible.  You'll notice that most people find sunsets beautiful, when they see them.  For another person to come along and state that that person is really talking about God, whether they know it or not, is quite a leap.  Certainly God wouldn't count this as a declaration of faith, and grant him salvation and eternal life, and why not?

Etc.

We each need to ask ourselves who/what/where is God *for me*.  Not what does CS Lewis or Pascal or Aquinas or Dawkins say, but *what do I say*.  There are arguments for God, but they aren't anything close to personal manifestations of God.  We don't, and shouldn't, need a book or a text or a tradition or an institution to bring us to God.  In fact, this common and strong tendency for conflation might be a clue as to whether he is there or not.  The medium isn't the message.  Nor is faith itself to be confused with faith *in something*.  Faith in what?  Faith itself?  The unknown?

For starters, let's look at his claims in the Bible of who he is:  among these, a loving father.  If I loved my kids as he appears to love me, my kids would A. Not know me (but they must have faith, because that's how I set up the rules, just because) B. Be estranged from me (but I love them mysteriously, at a distance, in ways they can't comprehend, mostly because they sin so much, and because I'm so much *greater* than them, and beyond their comprehension)  I won't try to make myself known, or make them experience my love in a way they can't deny, *even though I'm their father*, and this would be easy, if not automatic, for me. C. Probably develop and antipathy toward me.  And this is a real, earthly father, someone they can see and talk to directly! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, something like teaching by example even. The best learning is deeper and more unconscious than the direct transfer and/or memorization of concepts. 

Ive been lately struggling with this same stuff. Hiked up to Angels Landing in Zion National Park a couple weeks ago. Was surrounded by dozens of college kids on spring break, and one large church group of college kids. They had absolutely zero regard for their fellow hiker and zero appreciation of the beauty around them. Extremely annoying and obnoxious. To me there seemed such a chasm betwen the nature I was in and the nature of these people around me.  Was trying to find compassion, without condescension or arrogance. Couldnt find compassion at all. Or even understanding.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> scientology is one of those things where a "by any means necessary" approach isn't that necessary.  if you're on the inside, you've drunk the kool-aid. 

what i was getting at is that trying to get people to do things because it "isn't cool" is actually counter productive.  it encourages herd mentality, people behaving like frat boys (as the police do).  the right thing to do is often *not* what is hip. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i dont like scientology either. but you are encouraging a herd mentality and not trusting people to think for themselves. you are saying that making something cool or shameful is a good way to achieve a desired behavior. 

this is in fact something that promotes cult behavior in the first place: people doing something for acceptance, because it is cool, or to avoid shaming or ridicule. people need to think rationally for themselves, whether the herd is with them or not. rational, sensible, substantive arguments should be made in an environment that welcomes it. 

otherwise, you are just promoting a "good cult" to take the place of a "bad cult": "you aren't "hip" because you dont believe X Y and Z like the we do". THIS is what the world doesnt need.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you think it is obvious that Andy Goldworthy's art is just "nature stuff" and "autumn leaves", and nothing more.  You are caricaturing my post, and reducing it (I actually didn't say anything specifically about what makes it Taoist) to "the obvious".  Your problem with people stating the obvious is actually a problem you have with yourself repackaging and reducing something you think you see to be "the obvious".  *There are innumerable aspects of depth and variation and complexity to Goldsworthy's art.  This goes without saying.  This is pointing out the truly obvious - which you are either denying or are ignorant of.*

You imply that I'm missing how Taoism applies to our daily lives.  Actually, I'm expanding our realization of how Taoism applies to our daily lives.  Further, I can't cover everything in just one post.  I'll get to the rest of our daily lives eventually.

Your own comments argue against themselves and waste peoples' time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> no.  we're talking past each other.  you seem to always revert to something like: "everything is taoist."  

the banner to this subreddit needs to state that we all know the tao that is spoken is not the true tao, but we are going to speak anyway - just as lao tzu and chuang tzu did....  that that is the starting point.  otherwise you get these feedback loops like we are in now, when commenters like you keep repeating this mantra.  i wonder what your point is and why you even bother with this subreddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i dont disagree much at all with that.  only, to me, some things are more taoist and others less taoist- but only in our perception/conception of them. for instance, some books are very taoist, some explicitly so. other books are very non/un-taoist- books about scientology, for instance. though they think they are different and have a certain view, they actually cant help but adhere to the taoist principles, as you say. i suppose, then, that i mean the un taoist stuff wrongly views itself a certain way, when it cant help but be taoist. the disharmony comes only in this misconception and not in the actuality of the thing itself. this is why taoism is so refreshing: people find it was there along along. so i think a lot of art and literature is neutral on the matter, but goldsworthy's work struck me to be especially expressing ghe yin yang in a unique way. also growth, time, change, flow. one could potentially draw parallels to the watercourse way and the uncarved block, but id be careful there. 

if that makes sense. im in a hurry... </TEXT>

<TEXT> intelligence is of no value. the dumb is just as valuable as the smart. like the book of Ecclesiates says, the rain falls on everyone's heads and death awaits us all. it is a myth and delusion put forth mostly by academia that smart is better (in any real way) than dumb. dont buy in to their self-serving game. this would actually be an unintelligent thing to do - as following the herd generally is. further, most truly intellingent people never get recognized. and they also usually realize that real intelligence doest give a flip about recognition from the masses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are full of it. Bananas arent the only fruit, fyi. So you are already following my advice and paying attention to sugar content in fruit, and distinguishing between them. Sure call it fructose, but that doesnt change the point. Try eating pineapple every day for a month. You will gain quite a bit more than if you ate a typical vegetable. Whether it makes you fat like people at the supermarket isnt the freaking point. Either way, to say all fruits can be eaten as much a vegetables can be, and there is no danger from the fructose/sugar content in some fruits is goddamn ignorance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Jesus Christ, the paradoxical God-man, who is both Atonement and Prototype. (For Kierkegaard, following Luther, faith must needs give rise to works.)

Then who/what was the object of Abraham's faith?  Weren't the objects of SK's and Abraham's faith the same thing?

 Revelation through the Word of God, the witness of the Holy Spirit, and the Spirits gift of faith (see, e.g., For Self-Examination, pp. 25ff., 77, 81-82).

These are indirect manifestations, if they are manifestations at all.  Words are hardly manifestation, unless they are audibly spoken and heard directly.  The "witness of the Holy Spirit" is an inside baseball term used mostly by Catholics; I don't know what it means.  And if the Spirit gives us faith, then what is there to worry about?  Does it only give faith to the good and pure?  If so, it's not much of a gift.

Indirect manifestations are easily doubted, challenged, confused and conflated.  Why would a self-proclaimed loving father *only* manifest himself in indirect, mysterious ways?  Especially, when he has power to do it literally any other way you can imagine (even retroactively) and with no negative side effects?  

 Epistemologically, because the manifestation does not provide apodictic certainty

Sure, but this is subjecting God to the limitations of man.  He supposedly can and does transcend our limitations all the time, just not in ways that we really need it, ways that aren't disputed, conflated, etc.  I mean, he supposedly made/makes the rules.  If he wants a relationship with us, he should make himself known.  He should love us like he asks us to love others.

I'll check out Ferreira's piece ASAP.  Thanks.

<TEXT> If everything is Taoist then you have no point at all. And what are you even saying? You're certainly not disagreeing with me. Did you read what I said about you not understanding paradox? The paradox here is using words to explain that words are the problem, that words are anti-Tao - since it needs to be spelled out for you. Read the first sentences in the TTC - for starters. 

You began by saying I have a limited view of the way. Then you go in to say that nothing is 'more' or 'less' Taoist. 

For instance, using the most simple example possible: if the tao that can be described is not the true tao, one would have to say that the tao that is described is not the true tao. You, contrary to this, are saying that the tao that is described is just as true as the tao that cannot be described. You are dead WRONG about THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE TAO. 

So you are either a fool or a liar or both, as your very statements make clear. You aren't fucking honest with yourself. Stop playing semantic games while claiming that words and artificial distinctions are just as Taoist as anything else. You are wasting our time.

<TEXT>  In a perfect world it wouldn't matter, but in today's society social visibility goes a long way toward determining what people determine is the "norm". More public figures that are not-heterosexual there are, the less people will see non-heterosexual people as strange or not normal.

Instead of trying to make something "normal" by getting it out there and making people think more people are into it, try to encourage people to be themselves and do what is right *regardless of whether is is accepted by popular opinion, or regarded as normal, etc.*  Because we all know that "normal" has nothing to do with popular or accepted, and even less to do with whether this or that individual *should* behave a certain way.  The road is narrow, right?  Sure, it might encourage them by knowing it is accepted, but that doesn't mean anything.  It puts the cart before the horse and actually is counter-productive in that it turns people inside out.  You tell them that what matters are appearances, not what you choose to do privately and by *your own* conscience.  So much of the gay movement doesn't get this.  They want acceptance, including self-acceptance, so they act out.  They turn the most private thing into everyone else's business.  Then they defend themselves on the grounds of a right to privacy.  So there is this reflexive disposition among gay people to cheer on anyone in the public arena who is gay or bi or lesbian and comes out.  Like Ra Ra Ra someone is gay and they tell everyone about it.  Most people don't have a problem with gay or bi people practicing their sexuality.  It is this overt "look at me, I'm gay" thing that betrays a deep artificiality to it all.  It appears too forced and external and even political to be natural.  

  Well, I can definitely tell you that I didn't choose it.

Maybe you didn't choose it.  But if you look at gay males, for example, you'll find that they didn't have a bond with their fathers and/or were extremely over-feminized by their mothers.  This makes them want a male bond, makes them act like women, etc.  Not a choice?  Maybe.  But certainly not genetics or biology either.

 Um, it isn't your place to determine people's sexuality, so why are you even asking this?

I'm not saying it's my place to determine people's sexuality.  I'm saying I shouldn't even be able to know what it is, right?  Because it is so private, as homo's and bi's themselves argue.  But you are implicitly advocating that homosexuals or bi people let everyone know - so that it can look like a lot of people are into it and therefore it is then somehow regarded as a norm.  Why is this even in the public sphere?  Instead of advocating for gay marriage, those on your side (I'm not sure about you, specifically) should be advocating for getting government out of all marriage altogether - especially if you're an anarchist.

<TEXT> the first part:  for instance, is homo/bi-sexuality a choice, or is it an acquired taste, or is it biology?  

the second:  the OP was cheering on a bisexual governor.  if you regard that as just someone, who happens to be an anarchist, saying something nice about someone (based on sexual preference, and the fact that they're a governor) in what happens to be an anarchist forum, then....you have no point at all.

still: i'd like to hear it explained why/how i even can or should know someone's sexual preferences.  aren't they private, not my business, difficult to determine without being given signs/mannerisms/queues, etc.?   </TEXT>

yet:  the best writing is by authors who remove themselves from the story, and are completely a medium. they are transparent and not injecting hints of themselves. it detracts and is distracting. it is not about them.  it is immensely distracting and counter-productive to not use quotes. 

i strongly believe he is perhaps the most over-rated author of our time. good grief, how much is he going to descibe a sunset with "thin" and "like blood"? try to find another word, cormac. and this punctuation thing is just over-the-top. Pretentious BS in my opinion.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is Li? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-08 22:34:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know that Li is organic order, as opposed to mechanical or artificial order.  What I really want to know is if this is a subcategory of wu wei, or could be regarded as its own separate principle of Taoism.  

I am writing a paper and that is why I ask, and have to organize it and articulate it somehow.  I realize that really Taoism doesn't have principles and can't be reduced, or formulated, etc.  

Right now, the categories in my paper are 1. Yin yang 2. Wu Wei 3. Te.  Would Li be a subcategory of one of these or its own category?  I welcome any tips or advice on this matter, and on Li in general.  Thanks. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-06 18:47:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> How does Taoism reconcile mental illness?  Is it natural, is it a type of disease?  What about mental illness that is brought on by trauma?  Also, mental illness can severely complicate one's relationships.  If we are to live in harmony with each other, how can that be achieved if one is so involuntarily out of harmony with themselves?  I would appreciate any and all thoughts on the matter.  Thanks. </TEXT>

Where do you suggest, and why? Thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Taoism and Other People and The Law of the Jungle (a question) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-18 05:55:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm somewhat new to Taoism and have arrived at a big question, or questions.

What I'm reading describes the uncarved block, and the watercourse way; basically, that nature is It. Nature is the One and only. Man should look to nature for the Way things are, and seek to live in harmony, and be united with, this Way. I'm clear on this insofar as nature is concerned. However, what about other people? Aren't other people full of all sorts of complications, delusions, misapprehensions, constructs, deceptions? If other people deviate from Nature, or the Way, aren't they outside it, or apart from it? Does Taoism include other people as part of Nature - because they may operate very differently than any sort of pure thing? Nature is lions eating antelope. Nature is the strong consuming the weak. Nature is the Law of the Jungle. Am I to assume that Taoism affirms this when it comes to people as well? What about the corrupt (politicians, banksters, mafia, etc.)? They deceive and devour anything in their way. Are they the lion, and thereby justified in their strength over the weak? Does might make right?  *What does Taoism say about this?*

And there is this from The Tao Te Ching:
"Nature is unkind: It treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs. 
The Sage is unkind: He treats the people like sacrificial straw-dogs."  Lao Tzu

So....this is *potentially* an aspect of Taoism that viscerally repels me - the amoral, "I'm going to charm you then eat you", Law of the Jungle aspect. Am I understanding it correctly? Is there anything I'm not getting? What would Chuang Tzu think of Bernie Madoff? Please give me any information or direction you might think useful. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

**TL;DR** Taoism is about nature, about the Way. This would include the lion eating the antelope, the Law of the Jungle. What about when it comes to other people? How are we to regard other people and their delusions and deceptions?  As part of nature? Does Taoism deem it natural to "eat" (notice the quotes) and conquer other people? What would Chuang Tzu think of Bernie Madoff?

**EDIT**  To clarify, I omitted the anecdote about the Taoist who betrayed me - to which most comments have been directed and which was obscuring my real questions. I'm not asking how I should have handled or interpreted the situation with my business partner as much as I am asking:  What does Taoism say about other people who betray and deceive, etc.?  Does it consider them a part of nature or not?  I would appreciate direct answers to this, if possible.  I want to learn about Taoism and am not seeking to process any event in my past. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Edward Abbey and Taoism </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-13 23:51:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From *Walking It Off*, by Doug Peacock:

"Ed Abbey had little use for organized religion but nevertheless believed there were observable guidelines for living, an accessible wisdom residing in the land, often tapped into by the native peoples, observing the natural world for the appropriate cycle of life.  Ed had always called the Taoist philosopher, Chuang-Tzu, the first anarchist.  Tao or Dao, means the Way or the Path, and this image (the nature of truth as trail) is far older than literature.  All ancient and traditional people had a Path and knew the seeking of the Way, and these instructions were often remarkable in their similarities.  It is the organic way for humans to know and think about their place on earth.  For Ed, the Way was wild nature, and the Path was a person walking in it utterly attentive.  That place was our original habitat, the wilderness, the Heart of the Lotus, and it was less a path than an off-trail bushwhack.  'When your mind is empty like a valley,' said Lao-tse, 'then you will know the power of the Way.'" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read everything of his, one book and then another. My favorites were "Father and Son", "Fay", and "Joe".  Wasn't into "Dirty Work" and "On Fire" so much. Have tried to find other authors similar, but didn't care for Barry Hannah or Harry Crews or (most of) William Gay. I found Tom Franklin excellent. My preference is for it to be a little dark and moody with some suspense/tension, but real. Any hint of pretense or self-aware author who is trying too hard, isn't good. Any thoughts on Ron Rash or Frank Bill?  Novels, not short stories. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> How banks systematically steal from you (one of the many ways). This is my experience. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to Wells Fargo to deposit a paycheck.  They told me it wouldn't register in my account until the next business day.  As I recall, it was about noon.  After depositing the check, I called my employer, who also happened to be my dad.  I asked him if he could look at his account and see if the money I had just deposited had been withdrawn from his account.  (He banked with a different bank than Wells Fargo.)  In fact, the money had been withdrawn from his account.  This means that the money wasn't in his account and it wasn't in my account.  *Where was it?*  That's right: In Wells Fargo's account....until the next business day.  

Every day for every paycheck/deposit after a certain time, they don't register it in the depositor's account until the next business day.  This means that they use the money themselves, lend against it, etc.  They have and use this significant rolling cushion of money that isn't theirs, that inflates their reserves by a given, though slightly varying, amount every day.  They position themselves as the middleman who takes his time transferring what isn't his; takes his time and *actually uses* what isn't his.  THIS IS THEFT.  This is systematic thievery practiced every day on many, many people.

When I got my next paycheck a couple weeks later, I went to Wells Fargo and recounted the above to a few tellers behind the counter.  I asked them if I could have cash for my paycheck instead of depositing it.  They said sure, and gave it to me.  I then asked them if I could deposit the cash.  They refused it and told me I'd have to go to another branch to do that, and wouldn't say why.  It was probably because I had gotten wise to their scam and had told them about it.  Since when does a bank refuse a *cash* deposit?

Further, one of the reasons they gave for not allowing me access to the deposit until the next day was for "my protection".  They had to take the check to another city about 250 miles away - presumably with one of those stagecoaches - to verify its authenticity and validity.  However, when I asked for cash, they had to give it to me, and "my protection" was no longer important.


TL;DR  I discovered that banks steal from us by often not making our deposits available to us until the next business day.  However, they do immediately withdraw them from the account that pays them.  For that partial day, banks use that money themselves, as neither the payer or payee has it in his account for that time. </TEXT>
