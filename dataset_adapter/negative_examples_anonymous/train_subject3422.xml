I'm slowly losing my hope in this sub. First Do I Need A Jacket. Then Hexacon. Following with CS: GO post. Everybody is just copying the other. Now it's triangle post. I swear to God that I saw three if them on my scroll down here (9h after upload). The first triangle post even went up two months ago.

Smh

Still respect for changing it up and good job Haha  </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by forgetting vodka on a table </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-27 16:37:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this happened two days ago.

On a class trip to Italy, it was ordinary for us to get drunk daily. We are all 16 so it is legal for us to drink beer and wine, both in Italy and in Austria.

Every night we would leave the home and buy drinks, come back and fuck ourselves up. Two teachers attended the trip; one of them didn't two shit about how drunk we were; the other was incredibly interested in what we drank and making sure we stayed legal.

On the first night we went out and bought a 4l (1 gal) bottle of vodka. Of course the barkeepers didn't care about our ages. As long as we pay no one asks for a pass. This enabled the 6 most eventful nights of my short 16 year old life. 

Well it was the last night in Italy and we decided; why not drink before we leave for the train? We can drink on the train as well. (We drank on the way there)

As only a quarter of the bottle was left friend 1 left it on the table. Friend 2 told him to "hide it better". Friend 1 put it behind a pack of chips and went, "That's the best hiding spot ever". We all went, "NO". And left it at that.

And so we drank, playing drinking games and being noisy causing the teacher who didn't give a fuck to enter the room. He immediately noticed the bottle and asked, "Are you retarded? You can't just leave a bottle of vodka out like that" Doing his duty as a teacher and because the other teacher was there he confiscated the bottle and told us to think about it and tell him the truth.

Friend 1 took the fault on himself because his parents didn't give two shits about him drinking, unlike the rest of ours, and left the room. (Have to note he was very drunk, so one of us went out to assist him.) 

Turns out all our parents will be notified on this anyway. I'll keep updated.

TL;DR Got caught by teacher with vodka bottle on class trip. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened yesterday as we were on our way on a trip to Italy. As typical as it is our sixteen year old asses got drunk as fuck on the train.

It was three hours after peak, as we began talking. I kinda admitted that I'd had a crush on this girl for the past years. 

Turns out, every guy in my class had one on her aswell...



We want to inform her about this hh...

<TITLE> [Unpopular Opinion?] I think Fl Studio 12 is ugly. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-22 21:55:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So 7 hours ago FL12 was released. I, like probably everyone else here, immediately downloaded and installed it. Unlike the most of you I did not try the beta though, for I was waiting for a stable version. Only after I had installed FL it loaded with a flat yet childish UI that I personally do not favor over FL11's. The font is a impact roundish font that is rather large at times and does not blend with the interface. FL12 looks like a toy to me. I prefer FL11's professional looks.

<TEXT> Yeah. I just found a method to run from RocketDock/Desktop

#YOU NEED TO SAVE BOTH LAYOUTS FIRST


TO MAKE THE JOB EASIER FOR YOU UNHIDE APPDATA. if you don't know how to do so look it up. 


Create two .bat files using Notepad 

Type:

**Taskkill /im Rainmeter.exe**
(***repeat for the amount of skins you have loaded + the one above is the process itself***)


(Enter)


**start "" "C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Rainmeter.exe" "C:\Users\[*USER NAME*]\AppData\[*SKIN LAYOUT NAME*]\Rainmeter.ini"**


**INCLUDING QUOTATION MARKS**


Save as .bat


Do again for both monitors

^NOTE^: don't forget to change the screen layout name to the one of the second monitor. After you copy and paste. 

PS: you can convert to .exe. With online program. When compiling to exe check invisible Program. Now cmd will not show while running script.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened to me too. I run a laptop with a second monitor. Everything on the second screen ends up disorganized on my monitor when disconnected. 

My last resort, after hours of trial and error, was to create two layouts. One for single monitor on the move and another for dual monitor. Tested and it works well. As for now this is the only solution. I am still looking for a method to load the layouts from the desktop/rocket dock  (too lazy to enter the program everyone at school.)

I'll keep you up to date.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> No Smooth Scroll and Touchpad Zoom </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-19 11:34:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since I moved to a laptop a few months ago, I have stuck to using IE11. Don't judge me, but I have found it to be remarkably good, as it supports auto-correct, touchpad zoom and smooth scrolling which I absolutely love using. I use a mouse while producing music and therefore the smooth scroll comes in handy.

I do know that there are plugins for this on the chrome store, and at chrome://flags. But these controls are often wonky and I'd like them natively and stable in chrome. I do prefer IE over chrome at the moment as there are certain sites which format wrongly on IE. IE also does not completely support HTML5.

For now I'll stick to IE having chrome installed as alternative, for the sole reason that IE is easier to use for the laptop. I'd be happy to switch to chrome in an instance, if they integrate smooth scroll and tp zoom natively.

I do know that this is not the perfect place to portray my opinions, but frankly IDGAF. sorry guys </TEXT>

Nigger and nigga are only variations of this and anyone who uses a variation as an insult is simply stupid, gosh!! So the meaning of gay comes from happy.

<TEXT> Many ppls say that 60fps does not work on ie11. It might not work on ie11 on windows 7 but it surely works on windows 8.1 .8.1.1. In fact ie11 on window 8.1 I more graphics efficient than chrome. I use ie as my main browser and have only needed to use chrome once. (to watch anime.. animebaka.tv) ie does not support certain html formats. I only use chrome for one website though... anyways ie is faster on my PC. Opening and running sites </TEXT>
