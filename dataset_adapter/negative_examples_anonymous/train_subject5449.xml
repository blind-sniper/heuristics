<TEXT> You know, it's funny you should mention silver bullets. Before he passed out, T kept saying,"I swear to god, it was a skinwalker..."

Now, I laughed at him, but I heard it too. It did sound like it teleported from the neighbors shed to the side of my house. But, like I wrote, it sounded a bit lower in pitch, making me and G pretty sure, there were at least 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before it got dark today I did just that. I was looking for tracks beside the house. I didn't see any. I also checked around the shed. Behind it is a lot of, well, trash and crap. I didn't see any tracks but it did appear some things had been moved and there was a spot by the corner of the shed (whereabouts we heard it growl/howl both nights) that seemed the grass and weeds were pressed down. Like something had been sitting or standing there. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It started a few weeks ago, my boyfriend was going to his car. He did a visible double-take and said he thought he saw something next to his car, slouching. I asked him if he thought it was a neighborhood dog, he said it was way too big. He and I looked around, but saw nothing.

Flash forward to this past Friday. My boyfriend, his stepbrother, and I were sitting on the back porch, talking and trying to build a fire in the fire pit. We heard this loud, high pitched sound coming from the tall weeds behind where the cars are parked. It sounded large and aggressive. His stepbrother and I had never heard this sound before and we were taken aback. My boyfriend, however, stopped talking and said,"Holy shit! I swear to god, I heard that same animal the other morning when I got home from work, only it was a deeper sound and it sounded like it was in mourning. It was really sad to listen to, it sounded so sad." Immediately, I wanted to go inside. Whatever it was sounded pretty close and pretty big. It didn't sound exactly nice, either. But, being as men are, my boyfriend and his stepbrother got out a super bright flashlight and laser lights and started to aim it right where we'd heard the cry. After a few minutes of this, I went inside and watched through the glass door, the guys seemed alright and the light show devolved into a bit of fun as they shined the green and blue lasers on the shed behind the house and I figured we were alright, so I went back outside. We resumed sitting on the porch and I had the cat, Tiny, in my lap. He was almost passed out, purring and snuggling with me. We had pretty much all but forgotten the noise earlier and had given up on the fire. It was maybe 20 minutes later when we heard the cry again, this time it was much closer, behind the shed, maybe 40ft from us. Tiny shot out of my lap and ran, somewhere, it's hard to say because my boyfriend, his stepbrother, and I were like a shot, too. We ran for the back door like our lives depended on it. "Whoa, what the fuck was that!?," I said. My boyfriend just kept saying, "it was over behind the shed, wtf?!" His stepbrother was white as a sheet. We were pretty freaking spooked. I know I have never heard anything like that, ever. I couldn't place what I'd heard to any animal I've ever heard. We went into the living room, turned on the tv, and decided to sit in. We heard some sounds like heavy steps on the back porch, my boyfriend swears he heard the sound again, but he thought it was by or on the back porch.

Then came Sunday. My roommate came home from a business trip, and we were sitting on the back porch, just talking about life. We both stopped when we heard a sound from the foresty area behind the house, beyond the field. He looked up and said,"What was that? I've never heard that before." (He's lived here 15 years, btw.) A few minutes later he and I went in. He had work in the morning and had to be up and out by 5:30am, so we said our goodnights, and I went to bed.

Monday. It started out like a very nice day. I went with my boyfriend to my parents, my aunt was visiting from Virginia with her three boys and my boyfriend had to leave for work around 9:45pm. We said our goodbyes and it had been decided my brothers would give me a ride home. We left around midnight and the instructions from my dad were they were to drop me off and go straight home. We should have listened. But, being as family is, my brothers wanted to hang out for a bit. We went inside to get refreshments, and I went outside real quick to light the lantern. I went back in for a second to tell them we should sit outside, it was cool out and a clear night. We walked outside and I saw the lantern was out, there was almost no wind. "Weird, that thing has a big wick, maybe it's out of fluid?" I relit the latern, it burned bright, it wasn't out of fluid. We all sat down and played with Tiny, talked about what we were up to, video games, etc. That's when I heard it. It was far off, by the foresty area. It sounded like a deep, long howl. It almost sounded aggressive. I immediately recognized it from the other night. I said,"Did you hear that?" My brother (we'll call him T) said,"Yeah, I heard that. I wasn't going to say anything, but I did. It sounded, like a dog, but not a dog." My other brother (we'll call him G) said he hadn't heard anything. I told them we should go in, that I'd heard this thing before and last time it sounded like it got really close. They looked at me like I must be exaggerating and we kept on talking. Maybe 15 minutes went by when G sat straight up and said, "What the fuck was that?" Neither T nor I had heard anything and he started pointing by the shed and was about to say something when we heard it. A very loud howl, growl sound. It was over by the neighbors shed and it was overrun by another, lower pitched howl, growl. It was on the fucking side of the house, not 20 ft from us. We immediately shot up and bolted at the back door. I have never moved so fast in my life. Whatever it was, there was more than one. And it was close, sounded big, and aggressive. I was the last one in, being pushed out of the way in the mad dash to the door. I locked the door behind me. We were really scared. It was so close to us. We all started talking at once. "What the fuck was that?!" "I've never heard anything like that before!" "There was more than one, omg, it was like surrounding us!" We migrated to the living room. G decided that whatever, whoever it was, had to be dealt with. He has this big pocket knife, grabbed it and told T to come with him. T looked scared but didn't want to look like a wuss to his younger brother, so he went with him. I begged them to not go outside. The neighborhood dogs, save for one, didn't bark. In fact, it was weird, as loud as these howls were, there was no reaction. I think that creeped me out all the more. Were they as scared of whatever it was as we were? These dogs bark at everything and everyone, but hadn't made a peep. I was still telling my brothers to not go outside, but they disregarded me, this thing had to be found and dealt with. T and G went outside, they had me lock the door behind them. I paced by the door, peeked and saw them on the porch, talking. I thought, maybe we are being silly, but no sooner had that thought gone through my head when I saw my brothers stiffen and run back to the door. They looked so scared. I unlocked the door and let them inside, locking the door behind them.

"What the hell happened?!" I asked.

"It's still there!!" Said T.

"It's was hitting the side of the shed, slapping it," said G.

We avoided looking out windows for the rest of the night. G and I stayed up as T passed out on the couch. We discussed animals it could have been. Wolves? Coyotes? A bear?? It was definitely big. It was definitely aggressive, and it was more than one. We still don't know what it was. I told my boyfriend, who told G to go kill it. G said he wasn't going back out there. 

My brothers ended up spending the night. In the morning, G, told me he went back outside to see if it was still there, he said he heard it over by the shed, said it sounded like it was trying to break in. Still, no peep from the dogs.

Now, it's Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. I'm sitting alone in my house. My boyfriend is working and my roommate is on another business trip. Everytime I've heard it has been after midnight. I have my .22 nearby. I feel like I'm just waiting, but I refuse to go outside. Not after dark. Not anymore. There is something out there, and it is getting closer everytime I hear it. I don't want to go toe to toe with this thing. Not gonna lie, I'm still quite spooked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was quite broke at the time so no taxi. It was only a few blocks, but it could have easily been the last time I walked free again. It was in the daytime, too. Close by UCF, which makes sense. Lots of easy prey around there if you are looking to nab girls. I definitely feel lucky I followed my gut to watch the vehicle. Looking back I almost could swear I felt being watched before I saw the guy, but that could just be hindsight.

If you ever have a daughter, I'd recommend she knows some self defense, or carries at least mace with her. I ran, yeah, but I would be willing to bet running isn't always an option. Luck was in my favour that day. But still, it was so scary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I lived in Orlando, I had a fight with my ex. He left me to walk home a few blocks. On the way home I saw a black suv with dark tint windows. The front passenger window was down and a man with black sunglasses was staring at me. It seemed odd, but I kept walking and watched as he pulled a u-turn. I thought he must've been going the wrong way, but kept an eye on the vehicle and watched as it pulled another u-turn and came back toward me. The guy sped up and turned into a side street where he abruptly stopped halfway in the turn and was partly on both roads. He jumps out of the suv, wearing a black suit, nice black shoes, black hair, and starts hauling ass towards me shouting Hey! Stop! at me. I never have ran so fast in my life. I ran down the sidewalk til I saw some bushes and people. I started yelling at them, but they never looked up at me. I ran behind the bushes and when I turned around the guy, and his suv, were gone. It was terrifying. I cried the rest of my way home, so scared the man would come back. When I got home, I immediately told my ex who told me I made the whole thing up just to make him feel bad for making me walk home. It wasn't long after that I found out about the sex slave trade and how many girls in Orlando disappear annually. My ex was a bastard, for the record. But that event, I try to really not think about, it makes my heart race with fear still thinking about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find there are some parallels.
1. The LDS has temples, Scientology has Training Centers.
2 They both have a Leader.
3. They both require time, and lots of it, from their members.
4. They both require money to use their temples and training centers.
5. They both have programs that take them away from family and friends. Missions for LDS and Sea Org for Scientology.
There are more, but I am tired. I've really looked into Scientology, even considered joining at one point. As time went on the less and less I wanted to join, however. They require too much of their members money. You can't leave without them harassing you, and it's much more intense than love bombing an inactive members house with candy and paper hearts riddled with scripture and "We miss you!" notes scribbled in Beehive handwriting. Missionaries go for 2years. But scientology has the Sea Org. This is a Million Year contract they get youth to sign up for. They are paid for their work, but it's slave wages. The men at the top of scientology are insane. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something like this happened to my sister. She was sitting next to her friend late one night and called his phone from hers. When she called, his phone didn't ring but her end did. A woman answered the phone and said my sister had woken her up. My sister, very confused, recited the number and the woman said it was her number, had been for years. When she hung up she asked her friend who the woman was but he was just as confused. So my sister thinks it must be a hiccup in the service and calls the number again. Once again her friend sitting right next to her with phone in hand, his phone doesn't ring. But it rang, again, on her end. The same woman answered and asked her to stop calling. 
My sister said she felt bad for waking up someone who was asleep, but it bugged the crap out of her and her friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will tell you, it isn't all it's cracked up to be. Yes, losing over 50lbs is awesome. I went from obese to a healthy 120lbs at 5'3. There are some downsides to it. If I'm hungry, I will smoke and that will drive away my hunger. Some days I smoke all day and clean my house, but totally forget to eat. I actually drink protein shakes to curb the cotton mouth and to ensure a decent caloric intake in a healthy manner. My boyfriend actually has to remind me to eat! Or at least to finish my plate, which is hard because I'm simply not hungry. I have thought about quitting, but bud does help with migraines, my nausea from said migraines, and my monthly aches and pains. As a child I suffered from upset stomachs all the time(almost daily), as an adult I still do. Bud is the only means I've found to help overcome this problem. The struggle is real, my friend.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey OP! If you would like answers, go ask them at r/exmormon. They will use critical thinking and logic to help answer questions you are having. Might sound crazy to ask people who have left, but they are quite nice and you will find that you aren't alone. When someone tells you to just rely on the church for answers when many things the church asks you to rely upon can be proven false, then is the time to think critically. Any church can bring a burning of the bosom, but facts lead to actual truth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it is all bs. I think that laws and regulations do slow the process. If they just went in and did what they want without permission it would cause a lot of issues. I agree that the show devotes a lot to back story repeatedly, but this season has been good so far. I'm always up for a good mystery! And trust me, I want answers.

In regards to the ama, I see lots of downvoted to his answers. This is unfortunate as this guy seems like a good guy, and seems to answer honestly. People might not like his answers, but he seems courteous and positive. I give a lot of credit to that. Reddit can be harsh, and he took it all in stride, graciously.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cynicism aside, what has been discovered there actually is interesting. I think there is something there, even if they don't find it. There have been some odd things found there, structures underground that are made of non-local materials. To simply scoff at the whole venture is idiotic. If this kind of find was discovered in, Egypt, for example, no one would be scoffing at it. 
In any case, treasure hunting is fun. There is mystery and myth. One day we might find something, or not. Heck, it could be originally a floating island and all those layers at the money pit could simply be the construction of the island itself. Who knows?  </TEXT>

No one deserves to go to a brainwashing camp. Hope he stays safe tonight, and not in the tree house. That is so cliche and one of the worst places to hide. Once they locate him there, and they easily will (whether or not his friend rats him out) he will be trapped.

<TEXT> Thanks. I haven't started yet, but I do own a wonderful SW, SSB, Longwave, AM/FM radio. Something about being able to listen to the world has always fascinated me since I was little. The waves just floating through the air, needing an ear to listen. One day I decided I wanted to put out my own waves for others to hear. Someday that will be a reality for me. Thinking about it makes me smile. Maybe that sounds corny but it is so neat. It's wonderful to know it isn't dying out. So no, I won't let that guy get me down! I know one day when I am older someone will look to me for knowledge and support. I will recall that some won't help because they are crotchety and grumpy. I will take my time and help them.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really up to the parents if they get their son circumcised. It is way common in America. I'm atheist and I'd do it to my boy if I had one. It is just normal here, and as long as it's done sanitarily I really see no issue. Female circumcision is vastly different, and causes vast issues for girls. Guys that are circ still jerk off, still cum normally, the loss of sensation is minimal (men still prematurely ejaculate with alarming regularity while circumcised). They just don't have Smegma and have less issues with cleanliness. It actually does reduce std transmission. Also, I've had both, and as a female, it is easier giving head to a guy who is circumcised because you don't spend all that time pushing foreskin back, more time spent playing with the shaft. I also know there are men who get the surgery done because of actual medical purposes. Does it have to be done? Almost always, no. But it can cause shaming in the boys locker room when you got extra skin down there. But then, such is the American way. Oh, and a circumcised dick looks visually larger, which is a plus to women. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate this, but I am seeing posts that show other people are encountering the same issue. Now, I'm no programmer, but I may have a cheap, quick solution to this issue I think everyone will appreciate, a lot. Why not go back into all the accounts you reset and blanket fix the issue. I believe this would save time (so you aren't fixing this bug individually) and it would therefore save money. I don't have access to my boyfriends game info, so I can't just give that out. But I know y'all as creators do have the info of all reset accounts. If you can do this, send me a message, or, put a message in game at startup saying this bug has been fixed. You can even put in a strongly worded message to everyone reminding to not hack or be banned. I know the fans would appreciate this and I think it might help with TinyCo's reputation a bit. It's a win-win. I know I won't be hacking it anymore, and I think a show of faith in that matter will sway others from doing the same. Of course, there are asses out there who will hack and need banning but I believe this could stem the tide of it. Anyways, I appreciate your response to this issue. It has actually convinced me to not delete the game. Good show, sir! </TEXT>

We're looking into this now. If you've been set to 250, then the warning/flag is considered complete.

Did you happen to force close when you saw the original TOU popup?

Also, does the TOU popup still appear when it moves to 250?

If you'd like us to take a look at your account in particular, please send a note to Support and DM me when you do. (I'll make sure it gets looked at.)

<TEXT> Oh, btw, TripleSkeet, TinyCo messaged me and they actually offered to fix the problem. They were pretty nice about it. I think RyanMercer needs to get off the rag. Maybe smoke some reefer, take a nap. He's way to aggressive about his views, which, as I can now plainly see do not reflect TinyCo's views. Gotta be honest tho, a little nervous about them fixing just my acct. I feel like this, if they can blanket reset everyone's accts to 250, they can blanket fix the problem. I feel like it's a much cheaper and quicker fix. It might also restore a tiny smidgen of faith in the company. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But he lost legally gained clams *after* the reset by TinyCo. Also, as I've been learning, he isn't the only one. TinyCo is being ridiculously dumb if they think they can just take clams they are freely giving out. I mean, if you give something to someone and then turn around and take it back that is called Indian Giving. It isn't the way a company should be running their business, it will lose customer loyalty faster than anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, you can't purchase much without a looooot of clams. The game is way too expensive. There isn't nearly enough land to put everything. There isn't much you can buy in the game with 'cash' as it is. The game crashes a lot, all the time, actually. The mechanics pretty much suck. I'm done with it. I was willing to bank my clams, build them up the right way, but seeing as how they take legally claimed clams, I'm fucking done. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love C2C, but before the show airs is a great show out of Portland, Oregon called Ground Zero. It's hosted by Clyde Lewis and I would go so far as to say he's a better host than Noory with more probing questions. I've been listening for some time now, and I just was wondering something. Why is there no subreddit for this show? He has done shows that remind me of old Art Bell from time to time and yet I see no love for him anywhere. I know he can't be that obscure, he is syndicated now. If there is a subreddit, let me know, please! I would love to discuss shows and ideas surrounding them. If there isn't, I believe one should be created. I can't imagine that everyone who listens to C2C regularly has just somehow missed this show entirely. 

I just want the discussion to start. Get the ideas flowing. Thoughts are welcome! Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend and I did use hacks for this game. However, I think the 250clam count is a cap for all involved. Reason being: He got a free clam from gassing the kids. His count went to 251 clams, he went to sleep, woke up, and they had removed that clam, bringing him back down to 250. I do not think he is going to be alone in this issue. If they are giving away free clams during play, then removing them because of their issue with our hacking, I'm going to be done with this game. A big thank you to all the givers, we know this isn't your fault. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I had an actual computer and not this touch screen bs, I would do it. I'd be able to go in depth the way I wanted. Essentially, I was in college in an apt with one of my roommates. We were just talking when strange things, sounds, started happening. It was an all night event. We were scared due to furniture being moved and slamming into walls, heavy furniture. At some point either I got scared or something happened to me, but I completely blacked out. Apparently, things did happen while I was blacked out as a friend basically told me years later (with much prodding) that she had to break into the apt, climb over massive amounts of furniture, and found my roommate and I huddled in a bedroom corner holding a big butcher knife looking extremely terrified and wild. My memory of that is nil. I recall waking up by my roommate waking me up in her bed saying everything was the way it was the night before. I recall being alarmed that I was in her bed, that it was the next day, I asked her how I got there, she said I refused to leave her room, but that wasn't quite what I meant. She didn't realize I had experienced missing time/blacked out. She was there with me that night, but refused to tell me what happened after I blacked out. She was too scared.

This was years ago, but the event still bugs me. What happened? Why all the sudden burst of activity? We were talking about her fiance, not playing with Ouija boards. Part of me wants to go under hypnosis to find out, but part of me is scared to do so. There is more to the story, but this is all I have time to type out. You can reply to me and ask questions! I will be happy to answer. </TEXT>

Have you looked into your missing time event, btw? There are resources to help you recall what happened. I've had one that to this day seriously scares me. If it weren't for the terror I felt before I blacked out, I would have looked into it by now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had many. They range from non-scary to terrifying. Sometimes I wish I knew why they happen so often to me. Maybe they happen more to certain people because they are open to it, maybe it is just 'right place at the right time' scenario. Who really knows? One thing though, they sure add a special spice to life that not everyone gets. </TEXT>

If that thing was as big and flying as low as people said it was, almost any camera should've been able to capture something. I know the pic on the newspaper that came out the next day was computer generated, I mean, c'mon! Not one person could have submitted a real photo of it? I really think they were confiscated. I bet people went to their film development store and the film was taken or exposed (on purpose) or something. With all those eyewitnesses there should be plenty of photos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This kinda is my point. Children can go their whole little lives thinking and believing something. I mean, so many of us believed in St. Nick. I'm sure there were kids that wanted to be elves. I'm sure some would have put the idea that if they could just look like an elf, they'd BE an elf. Elves don't exist, but try telling that to a child who believes firmly. Now, when I was younger I thought I was a witch. With POWERS. I waited on my 16th birthday for my 'powers' to show. They didn't. If I could have had a doctor give me 'powers', I would have. Witches aren't real, either. My point is that children aren't capable of long term thinking. They aren't capable of comprehending their actions. When adults, who should have critical thinking skills, who should be able to think long term, forget all of this and solely listen to a child say "I wanna be a boy, even tho I am a girl", I think they should be listened to, but it shouldn't be played into. If a girl wants to be a boy, put her in boy scouts (or a similar program), hell buy her boy clothes. Don't reassign her gender. It could be a really big, life long mistake. I think it's really scary when adults start treating children as if they are 'little adults'. It's insanity. You become an adult not just by age, but by life experience. A child has no life experience to grasp onto, they can't put things into perspective the way an adult can.

I would also like to say, I am not against reassignment surgery on adults. Adults of sound mind can do as they wish as long as it doesn't harm anyone. But, children? Let them be children. Don't play into their little games. We're the adults. We need to remember that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't talking about doing the procedure on adults. I am discussing adults entertaining the mere notion of changing the gender of a child. Even if 'money' isn't an issue, it is still a huge decision and definitely NOT one for a child to make. Even if that child becomes an adult and DOES go through with the surgery, I think it is better to wait. People change and children are not really ones to make knowledgeable, healthy LIFE LONG decisions. If Janie wants to become Jimmy at 10 or so, and then gets the OK to do it, Janie might realize later in life, "hey, I want children and I want to actually birth them." That person may miss out on things because they really thought and "believed" they were born the wrong gender. I also realize it is rare on non-adults, but I know it happens. Maybe I am naiive, but I do not believe this is something a child should decide. It's an adult decision. For an adult to make for themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what if the boys wore skirts? The real issue here is children being allowed to choose their gender. I swear to God if they had a surgery to turn a child into an animal because the child really believed they were born a kitty, they'd do it. A decision like that is life-long, and shouldn't be done because of a child's wants. Very disturbing. Children have no real world knowledge about their gender, that comes with time, learning, and mature personal growth. Children really have no capacity to make the decision of gender switching on a permanent level. For adults to entertain the question is a huge issue, too. Seems to me docs just want to make money with no real forward thought of what they are really doing.

Edit: Not sure why this got downvoted. I sincerely don't think people grasp the issue with children deciding their own gender. Children (and teens) can barely decide anything, they think they know everything, and how many of them really know next to nothing? I'd say a vast majority. I don't mean in the terms of learning, I simply mean in the terms of who they are. Children go their whole little lives wanting to be a doctor, fireman, police officer, teacher, rock star, actor, etc etc. You know what most of them end up doing? None of those things. They might be a nameless hack on the net. They might be flipping burgers at McD's. Children can't decide shit for themselves, let alone their gender. If it's really that huge of an issue, maybe, just maybe they should see a doctor who can help understand why they feel that way and that doctor can decide if they would be a candidate as an adult for the surgery. (They should do follow ups as the child grows to see if they even still feel that way, the child might not. Or they might. Oh yes, they should also be loved. No matter their ADULT choice.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I enjoyed many of my classes, I did find some of them to be full of 'woo'. My instructor was into energy ball making, discussing why AIDS isn't a real disease(she had the whole class convinced), and she was into using unproven techniques on the class and testing on it like it was a real practice. This bothered me, but what also shocked me was the gullibility of those in the class. They ate up that shit. Claiming they could see their energy balls or discussing how AIDS just couldn't be real. It was disturbing. I can see how some people might change in ways that might not seem normal after such a class. It's indoctrination in a sense. I guess when you pay a lot of money for something the bullshit seems better because you don't want to believe you've been duped. Common sense and critical thinking shouldn't go out the window just because your professor says something. </TEXT>

This happened with me in a company I worked for, it was actually quite a high paying job, and I was the one doing payroll. One week the owner blatantly said "The hours are too high for all employees, fix them"

The result wasn't pretty (hours wise) but...no one actually quit their job and all the murmuring was done quietly. It didn't feel good to do it as I knew for a FACT these guys worked their asses off, but that is what happens when you work in a company where EVERYONE is paid under the table. You just buck up and continue working. Shit happens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what got me into ufo's exactly. For me the best way to put it is I've always just had a internal personal knowledge that the Universe is teeming with life. I've always struggled to understand how it is that others simply do not feel the same way. I remember just learning to read and checking out all the ufo themed books in my school and library. I started listening to C2C with Art Bell while in 6th or 7th grade. Just anything I could get my hands on about the subject I actively seeked out. 

I have had sightings both personal and with others. I am not afraid of it and I don't see any reason to be. They exist. It isn't a belief, it's just something I've always known. I do not believe I have ever been abducted, so I couldn't make a comment about that.

As for what I feel about ufo's now? I feel that the whole phenomena is seriously being misrepresented and mishandled. The cheap shows about ufos on tv as of late is laughable. Who in their right mind  eats this stuff up? I can't stand a new show that claims to be all new present rehashed stories. It is a slap in the face to those paying attention.  I am sick of faked videos of ufos making it onto the screen as if they are real. Ugh. I'm not going to even get into ancient aliens. Not worth my typing. But I will say I had always hoped for the populace to get their heads out of their assets and recognize the vastness of everything that is around them. The space in which you and I live is great and we can't see it all. But! If we are here, then it only stands to reason that something else may be waaayyyy over there. And that something else could be anything, even a planet. And, if that planet is lucky enough to have had the right chain of events to spark life, as we were so lucky to have on earth, then maybe, just maybe, there's someone over there, too. 

Ahhh ufology, you have so much restructuring and building to do before I can take you seriously again. Til then, the truth actually IS out there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this will be very unpopular, but...

Time Warner Cable is my provider and my boyfriend had been paying the bill with his phone monthly. For some reason, they stopped processing the payments thru his phone to a non-existing account. We kept a record of the confirmation numbers given at the end of those payments. We didn't know they weren't going thru because when he'd call they would say we owed the same amount as the month before. It wasn't until I received a phone call stating I owed well over $350 to TWC that we realized something was wrong. I spoke to 3 different departments before they got me to the right one, but when they did they took down all the information, including the Verification Codes we had. Today I received my bill and owe only $35! They reinstated not only all the money but they took off a portion of this month's bill. I'm not saying "I 3 TWC!", no. But I do appreciate they did look into the issue and found the missing money and really helped me and my boyfriend in the pocketbook. 

I have no comment on AT T. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right. But simply stating that they saw a light in the sky is not lying. For instance, two weekends ago my boyfriend spotted a red light race across the skyline, north to south, over the ocean at Myrtle Beach. I also saw it as did his sister and a mutual friend. When people ask us what we think it was, we say we don't know. I think using the term UFO is alright, however we do not mean to say Extraterrestrial, we simply mean its literal term. Lots of sightings have been reported recently over that area, if I were to speculate I'd say military. But I don't really know. I wish more people would be honest and say they don't know instead of making up a fantastical story. In any case, that light, man, it sped across the sky so fast. Incredible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been out of the church for a long time, but, sometimes I still fall back into my old way of thinking. I get offended by things I have been taught to be offended by. I am so frustrated as I am acutely aware I shouldn't be offended. It is difficult and I don't know how to stop it. I mean its been almost 10yrs since I've been to church actively. Anyone else deal with that? Also I was seriously sheltered, so being an adult and being around other adults, it is a marked difference. My boyfriend doesn't want to shelter his son, but sheltering is all I know and a knee jerk reaction, and really quite natural for me. I know sheltering hurt me in certain ways so I don't want to do it, but I don't know then what is normal? This is all so foreign for me... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have not visited anyone about hypnosis yet, it is something I am seriously considering tho. And I don't recall 'grabbing a knife', I don't. No recollection, none. I only discovered that after the fact. My friend and I were at a Mormon College in Idaho. (byu-i). I did not have any marks, bruises, cuts, contusions, or anything that would suggest I physically fended off anyone with an intent to harm me or my roommate. We did have activity that we heard both in the apt and in our room. I personally saw a thick, white mist in the hallway billowing towards me at one point. As the only door and all the windows were locked and we were absolutely certain we were alone, we believe it was something else.
Whatever it was moved plenty of furniture, opened cabinets, moved silverware, and certainly scared the living shit out of me and my friend. I do think that I may have blocked it b/c of sheer terror and fear, but what could be more scary than what I'd already experienced? Why when we said a prayer did we see a black shadow move across the wall, and the activity stop for about fifteen minutes, enough time so that we started laughing about how weird and creepy that was only to hear grinding/dragging noises in the kitchen as we had originally heard? (that sound, btw, was chairs being dragged thru the kitchen, dining room, and into the living room, so it happened twice.) It was when we said something my Mother had told me to say in the presence of demons (In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave!) that is when everything just goes dark. Literally like a curtain being put over my eyes. I remember nothing until the next morning when my roommate woke me up to show me everything was back where it was the night before, like we'd never gone thru the apt and put all the chairs and furniture back. BTW, nothing ever happened in that apt ever again as far as I know. I don't know what it was, and I am pretty skeptical of ghosts, but I cannot discount what happened to me and my friend. I cannot discount what I heard, saw, or the nagging feeling of "i need to know" what happened that night. I am going to really consider what you said about going to psychics. I would prefer having an open minded professional that won't tell me I'm wrong about what I might find in my mind. Like, if they can't handle that I know I saw and heard some things then I wouldn't like to work with them on hypnosis. I need them to be able to listen without me fearing any kind of "you're lying", "you're mistaken", "that couldn't possibly have happened", etc etc. This event really happened, and I am sure it couldn't be just me and my friend that have had something like that happen to them. I just wonder why I blacked out or had missing time. That part bothers me more than any other aspect of that night.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Without going into too much detail, I had an experience one night many years ago with a roommate. We were talking in her room when a litany of incredible poltergeist activity began ensuing. Apparently, this went on all night. I can't actually say just what happened after one point since I literally remember everything suddenly going back. Since this night I've heard some snippits of things that happened. For instance, my friend who my roommate and I had called and left a voicemail, we asked her to come right away, something really scary was going on. When she arrived in the morning (she worked nights), she found my roommate and i barricaded into her room, huddled in a corner with a knife. She says that when she was able to get thru the barricade that me and my roommate attacked her. I remember absolutely NONE of this. Is there anyone here that has heard of or experienced any such thing? I have looked for years online and have not found anything that connects ghosts with missing time. Only ufos. I don't think this was a ufo abduction, b/c of my friend seeing me and my roommate in that way. Any ideas or comments would be greatly appreciated, this event has caused me to consider undergoing hypnosis to actually recall the events. </TEXT>

Things that were deeper than "the white house beer recipe". I understand that certain questions really deserved a more in-depth answer than could be given on an AMA, but to disregard all those important questions is suspect. However, the site crashed, so it's hard to know if he was going to answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really seems like the skeptic has never really looked into the phenomena deeply. I've been studying it for years, and yes, there is physical evidence. It's trace, but damnit it's there. On top of that, he sounds like an idiot. The picture they showed, while old, is famous and very well documented as a real *something*. He didn't even seem to recognize it. How can you have a skeptic that doesn't know the ins and outs of a phenomena he is so sure doesn't exist? I mean, let me give an example: I used to be religious. I know the ins and outs of the religion that I was a part of and when I was coming out of that religion to what I am now, I was able to look at all the facets and realize how every point was untrue. I can point to part of the religion and explain why it's false, I can PROVE it's false. This skeptic, couldn't do that. He couldn't prove his assertion. He just blindly stood by it. Pathetic. And yes, a Naysayer. </TEXT>

Also, I heard that Brazilian police are corrupt as all hell. They only take care of their own, and the people have learned to fend for themselves. Sadly, it looks like with the police bruatlity in America, it's slowly turning that way here, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reports of UFO's have been around since LONG before Chris Carter (creator of X-Files) was even born. And even before we had planes. I don't know why exactly the UFO's are interested in the US, you are right, there are more REPORTED sightings here. There are woodcuts from Nuremberg, Germany depicting battles in the sky between flying things from 1561.  Also, I would say that more people probably believe in ET's and UFO's in this day because of the sheer improvement in knowledge. We know that we're made of stardust, we know that the universe is incredibly old, we know that the building blocks of life are scattered throughout the universe. We know now about Panspermia. The chances of us being alone are nil. It's either us or there is a lot of life universally. So, if you start there, universe being old and filled with building blocks of life. Then you add in that we humans are barely a Type 1 civilization, and if you can imagine there may be Type 2 or even 3 civilizations, then it becomes harder to conceive that they wouldn't have technology to bend/fold/manipulate time and space.

So much to think about. But truthfully, the best thing I can tell you to do is look up. If you have access to GOOD Night Vision Binoculars, that will help too, as many of these crafts are only visible outside of our visual spectrum. Which could mean they are inter-dimensional or from another universe(maybe). It's just, honestly, super unlikely that we are alone. I think, you should start there. Contemplate: Could it just be us? Could this vast universe filled with the building blocks of life only have harbored life on Earth? I think if you consider it in those terms you will find that the odds are quite small we could be alone. Of course, if you are looking for a dead body and DNA, I am unable to produce that. 

Also, I don't know if the government is maliciously hiding information on this subject. I mean, I don't have special insider knowledge. BUT, I will say this: Our government HAS reported UFO's over nuke sites, these craft seemingly disabled (individually and remotely) their equipment. Also, you should look into the Rendlesham Forest Incident. Lots of military personnel reported seeing something strange over a few nights there, too. You can view the documents thru the FOIA. These are well-documented cases, too. The Mexican military also has RELEASED information and video concerning unknown flying objects over their skies as well. You can see this as easily as going to Youtube. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe because we don't share their media? And, honestly, MUFON is just one of the many UFO reporting networks. I don't speak Chinese, so I don't know what reporting networks they have out there that I might be missing.

Have you heard about the Hessdalen Lights? Those are in Norway. They have sightings in Australia that are frequently reported. 

Could really be a language barrier and that US media is USA biased in that they report mostly on things happening in the bubble of USA. 

When you see an accident, do you call the UK police? Or do you call the American police? I think if you consider that sort of thinking it might make more sense to what I'm trying to convey. But I'm certain these events happen worldwide...imagine what happens over the oceans that no one ever sees?

OOOH and if you notice, most sightings that are reported happen in first world countries. So, that is another thing. Do they only hapen over FWC's? Probably not, we just have the ability to do so. That guy in the African bush isn't gonna get on his Iphone to take photos and upload em to Facebook and Twitter. India is mostly a 3rd world coutnry, people are too poor to really report, and China? I mean, it's communist, so it's very possible a lot of info doesn't even reach us.

Food for thought. I'm exhausted and going to bed. Take care and good luck with your search!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> [UFO Stalker](http://www.ufostalker.com)
check out that site. The map shows reports from all corners of the globe,and NO, visitation does not only occur in the USA.

Also, not all photos or videos are blurry, either.
During my sighting I wish I had taken a photo or video, but I was much much too engrossed in the object merely 25 feet in front of me to really consider doing so. It can be quite the awe-inspiring experience :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want to give your money to a really great broadcast, you can try getting a Plus+ Club Account for Mysterious Universe.

You can see their extensive archive [here](http://www.http://mysteriousuniverse.org/tag/podcast/)|

These guys are based out of Austrailia, are hilarious, and they have some of the most interesting programming I've encountered in a while. It's like $9/month for the Plus+ Club, but it's worth it.

<TEXT> I used to listen to C2C, but when Noory took over as host he kinda, well, sucked. I continued to listen but I got bored of the content, and missed Art. I've since started listening to Ground Zero Radio with Clyde Lewis. His program and guests are awesome and Clyde is a fantastic host. He brings elements of Art and even Alex Jones (but much less shouting), and has that 'spooky' factor that I'm looking for :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My lover is leaving for college for the next 1 1/2 - 2 years. He won't have a car with him and I own no car. I am currently saving up for one, but it's going to still be a bit before I can see him. This is upsetting as I just found out Sunday and he leaves Friday. Words cannot express how much I will miss him and how much I also am proud of him, too. Such a mix of emotions that I am going thru. So much is up in the air. I worry, will he find someone else? Will he forget about me? Will he decide that a long distance relationship does not work for him? I wish I had a crystal ball, but I don't think I could peer into it thru my misty, watery eyes. </TEXT>

But it's good to hear that you are waiting, that is much more mature than believing that this guy you just met is your one true love because he's a RM and you've been dating for three weeks. He's not your true love, that's just hormones, bone the guy and move on. 

Or stay with him for years and build a solid foundation and then decide if marriage and children are what you want. :)

And you're right, it is ass-backwards, but it's really a form of control. It's kinda sadistic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FGM is actually a form of mutilation and the problems that arise from the surgery far outweigh the very very few benefits.

Circumcision for males has the opposite effect. This is something that can and has been proven.

<TEXT> man, look, this is probably the wrong thing to say to someone about to do this, but if you are hurting and you really feel this is the only way to end your pain. then do it.

why do we keep pushing people to live when all life brings them is misery? deep, emotional, painful misery. is it because we feel that it is our duty to keep them alive like we do with vegetables? is it some kind of morality reason? i just don't know why we want to keep something that is in pain alive. if your animal was hurting and you couldn't save it, you put it down. if this person is hurting, with no way of stopping that hurt, then we should let them put themselves down. having said that, how are you planning on doing it? </TEXT>

Thank you for your input. I really think that is the point they are at, is his level of comfort. It's really a harsh place to be,as his daughter, I'd rather he live a possibly slightly shorter life, where he can be happy, eat, smile, not have to wear a diaper for the rest of his life, and so on and so forth, than use treatments that could cause just awful complications.

I won't lie, my Mom is the one pushing for this TCM Dr, and his credentials actually don't look bad. 

The person who told my parents about this man, was a woman who has worked for the World Health Organization, and her husband had terminal malignant melanoma. All the top doctors this man went to said they could do nothing for him. Apparently he went to this dr, b/c he thought at this point it was a longshot but why the hell not, and two months later he was cured. That was 16 years ago. His cancer has NOT returned. So, I'm not saying this is going to happen to my father, but if he wants to believe in something, maybe mind over matter will help him to at least 'feel' better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of the people that have had his medicine did die. This is in his Testimonials. But, their quality of life before they died, may have been much more liveable. I don't have the ability to sway my folks in how they choose to approach this problem. But my Mom has seen so many people undergo Radiation Hormone Therapy, and seen how it really does change a person, not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, that she does not want that for my Dad.

If you knew you only had five years left, would you spend them fighting and being constantly sick or would you want to try to live out your final years more happily? I don't know if his has spread beyond what the surgery did, it's very scary for me, but I do wish for this time to be easier on him.

I do want him to undergo treatment from a western doctor, I am not really into the energy healing, tea-drinking mumbo-jumbo. I used to think there was something to it all until I went into Massage Therapy. I saw the benefits, but a lot of it really was ... mumbo-jumbo. I just, worry. Thank you for your insight. :) </TEXT>

Does anyone know anything about him? The man has a long list of credentials, and my Mom is really pushing for this vs Radiation Hormone Therapy. Now, I know that certain herbs have been shown to target cancer cells and kill them, but I am still wary on using them as a sole option.

Any thoughts, advice, or what have you, would be enormously appreciated. It's kind of a scary time for my family.

<TEXT> Thank you. I will ask over there. 

I really wish the choice was up to me, but it isn't. I have only the ability to show my parents the facts and voice my concerns. I am not saying that what this guy has to offer won't work, but I think what they are looking for is a quality of life if it has spread. My Mom said that while she knows Radiation Hormone Therapy can work, what it does to the body is very destructive, can make men grow breasts, have hormonal mood swings, along with the other myriad of issues it can bring. So, in a way, I absolutely understand that she wants him to be as comfortable as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd be highly skeptical of a meteorite, simply due to lack of evidence of any devastation that an impact of that size might bring to the surrounding land.

I fully agree there needs to be real-time video of this event, with multiple cameras on multiple live feeds. If aliens come out of there, I want to see! If it's a meteor, I want to see! If it's something man-made from Atlantis or what have you, I want to see that too! Truth is, it's not unheard of for governments to see something like this and close it off to the public due to "safety" or something. If that does happen, and there is censorship and a media-blackout occurs, pay very special attention to the terminology used, and people that live near there should be watching, too. They need to take pictures of the event, they need to ensure that the rest of the world knows what is down there. I don't think it's something we've ever seen before, but it could be an Oopart. I really feel like if that were the case, it'll be covered up, too. But if people are watching, and paying attention, then we will have info trickle out in the ways of videos, pictures, interviews, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not just the skeptics! There are people who are just blindly believing, they have a head nodding disease, they just agree with anything put forth on the subject. You have to approach this subject with a hefty level of skepticism. There are lots of liars out there, people that will say they had an experience just to write a book and make money off a popular topic. (This happens not just with UFO's and paranormal things, but women lie about being raped, but I digress...) If you are going to put forth an argument, have the common sense to be able to back it up, if you put forth information that you don't know is true, say you aren't sure. So many people aren't doing this on here. I find myself shaking my head at a lot of comments. It's really hard to see that. The discussions here could be epic and well thought out, but we are left with fluff and lots of lies and half-truths. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> That water is very very murky. This is one thing that bothers me, if they find it, and it's not natural and either an Oopart -or- is Alien, then the probability of them actually releasing the findings are slim. I doubt it's a meteorite, simply because there would be more pieces of it, there would be evidence of an impact of water/debris on land. I doubt it's a 'lost civilization' because of the track marks, and that there are two of these. Heck, it could be some old Atlantian airship, but we won't know until they find out.

<TEXT> Wow. The level of ignorance in this thread hurts me. I guess I'll have to actually spell it out. There were 2 objects found at the bottom of The Baltic Sea. The first one, is the one that is usually shown in pictures. There is a second, smaller object, as well. They have long drag marks that are still at the bottom of the sea, b/c the Baltic actually is quite still and there isn't much to change damage done to the bottom, even after long long periods of time. Now, it looks like these two objects may have been together at one point, may have hit something and broke off into two trajectories. (this is conjecture, but there is some evidence to back it up). Now, the first object, while huge, to me isn't as interesting as the less-known second object. This one is interesting. When they  tried to take photographs of it, they had a difficult time due to magnetic disturbances.

Something is down there, I highly doubt it's volcanic due to this info.

<TEXT> This happened to me a few days ago. I'm no slouch when it comes to sex, or so I thought. The guy used a lot of foreplay and in the middle of it I had to walk a bit. I couldn't see straight, I couldn't walk, it was like I was so drunk. It was a bit strange and the guy was great, helping me walk and keeping me from falling.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is that normal?? </TEXT>

And, with all the recent revelations of creatures being found in the depths of the oceans exhibiting behaviors and abilities previously unknown to mankind, the public is becoming more accepting to the notion of U.F.O.'s is much easier to accept. It really seems that the only people who do not believe are either highly religious or people who dismiss the data for whatever reason. :)  </TEXT>

I do remember there was one other part of the 'miracle'. The dr said b/c  of the way my pinkies tendons were cut and stuff that I would 1. have no use of my pinkies ever in life and 2. They would never grow past a three year old size! Neither of those things happened.

<TEXT> You are right, it was jarring. It completely shattered my view of the world and everything in it. I realized I knew absolutely nothing about the world and space in which I lived. I now knew something was out there, but as I have stated before, I would have expected some religious insight along with it, but..nothing. This lack of evidence in one manner and a strong opposition that is right in front of me(I was taught that there is NO thing out there, that this universe is void of all living things, even tho, in my deepest heart I thought it to be full of shit). To me, for some reason, there can't be a God if there is more. There can't be. And, even if there is, it's not for me to worry about. What I saw was much more interesting and definitely has a stronger possibility of reality (ufos/aliens) than an invisible sky daddy. </TEXT>

And, if you had read my previous responses, I do concede that I do not know for certain what it is I saw. I can't. I'd never seen anything like that before. It truly should be called an "unknown" but saying UFO is slightly easier to express to people who do not know what to make of it when you say "I saw an unknown". To say I believe-in what I saw, would be untrue as well. </TEXT>

It looked like a red blood cell, until it shifted it's shape. Like I said, I can call it a UFO but, in reality, what I saw was an "unknown". And it definitely seemed alive in some manner. Of course, I have to concede that even some of our technology to date would seem almost "alive" to someone living in the middle ages.

<TEXT> I saw this "unknown" while living in Florida. I was coming home from college class at night around 9:30. I had to drive from Orlando to basically Tampa (yea, it was a long way). I was just driving and to my right I saw this red light and then I thought, huh, what is that? And i saw this thing that looked like a red blood cell, and it just came toward me, made a beeline. It was really strange. I am actually amazed I didn't crash the van. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looked like a red blood cell. That blinked on and off, but kept a constant blood red glow to it. The part that looked like a "membrane" or "plasma" caught a lot of the light and seemed to prevent any kind of illumination on things unless they were very close (tops of trees, for example).

I saw it and it came right up to the minivan I was driving. About 25-30 ft away and slightly above my windshield. I saw the center of it. It looked like it was blood red, but I saw the center and it was yellow and white in the very center, and it was washing, like from the left to right, like in spin cycle. 
Then it just changed. The "membrane" around it faded away and the center stretched and it became what looked like a metallic remote controlled plane. Only flying backwards at 75mph and moving in a fig 8 pattern. It stayed there until (strangely enough) a police cruiser almost hit my minivan and came in between me and this thing and it veered off to the right and that is about when I lost sight of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was so close to me for one. So small. It looked like a red blood cell that would blink on and off, and then it shapeshifted into what looked like a plane. But even if it were a remote controlled plane, it would have to be going backwards, and the way it was moving was as if one was holding a baton in the center and moving it in a figure eight movement. It was pretty strange stuff. I have never seen anything like it, but I have seen videos on YT that really seem similar to what I have seen (including the shapeshifting). That makes me think, something is going on. </TEXT>

I had always believed "God" had made beings on other planets (the universe is gigantic as all get out) but religiously I had been taught they could never come in contact with us. When I saw this I realized, we weren't the most advanced anything. I realized my insignificance and how amazing it is that I am even alive. And somehow all that just fit :) </TEXT>

He could have slit it's throat, quickly and nearly painlessly.
No, he bludgeoned it to death. On top of that, there was physical damage to the guys SIDING. When the fuck did the cop have to smash the cat into the side of the house? I really think this cop didn't like cats and really, he didn't do his job. There are many ways to kill a cat, bludgeoning ANYTHING to death is just heartless and indeed, inhumane. Fuck this officer. If he can't hold it together to realize a better way of ending an injured animal's life, I wouldn't trust him to 'protect and serve' me, my family, friends, or even enemies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> bcccl, this event absolutely changed my life. I know that sounds cliche. But it really did. I never looked at things quite the same way, I saw something that most people never even have conceived of. Just seeing this made me recognize how little we really know about, well, anything. We are still just learning what is out there and even what is here. Our Oceans are largely unexplored. We know so very very little, and yet what we do know seems so very vast. It's amazing. And I'll tell ya what, the part that I have cog dis about is really the FACT that I have no litmus test to really know if what I saw was indeed UFO, or of Earthly Origin, or, and I concede this is a possibility, I was hallucinating. I truly hope it is not the last.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad's reaction shut me up about it and unfortunately I didn't contact MUFON til a few years after the event. Thankfully they took my story seriously and asked me (at extensive length) the full account, details and all. I am so happy I contacted them, being able to talk with someone, even an investigator, was almost therapeutic. I didn't feel as though I was being judged, which was important to me.

I have not been on TV for this event, and I don't believe anecdotal evidence is evidence. It's personal knowledge and until they perfect memory extraction, it remains as it is, a memory. Yes, I am familiar with the account of the vehicle that was hit by a UFO and they collected a powder of sorts. Very interesting stuff, but I have never spoken with that woman.

I wasn't that tired at the time of the event. I stated already it was about 9:30pm and I had been released a bit early from my college class. I had a 1 1/2 hour drive home and when I finally got home and ready for bed, it was actually pretty late. So, when I wrote about it I just watned to get a few things in there about it. Including the initial diagram. I have since gone back and written more in-depth about my account, including better diagrams.

Also, in the past two years I have learned about the kind of UFO I believe I saw. There is a lady on youtube, her handle is SeeingUFOsPa, and the lady has filmed innumerable hours of what I am pretty sure is what I saw. Unfortunately, she hasnt released any vids that would show these craft coming up as closely as they did with me, not even half as close as my encounter. As to your medication question, I was 100% sober. I have never suffered hallucinations and trust me, I still question whether what I saw was real or not. The mere fact I wrote it down when I did pushes me to believe that something happened. </TEXT>

I thought about it for weeks. I finally told my Dad, and he had some words for me. He told me to "lay off the crack", got up and left the patio. I just sat there, too stunned to cry, but feeling so incredibly hurt. I had seen something so rare and it was thrown back at me.

4 years later, I still feel like I have no answers. I still struggle to understand what I have seen. I contacted MUFON. The lady I spoke with was very interested in what I had to tell her. She sounded very eager to hear what I had seen.

I'd like to also say, I've seen things in the sky before, but only way up high. Nothing could have prepared me for this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My 1st Kind Experience </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-10-10 04:47:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am going to do this kind of as an AMA-style, but with the questions to have focus on the experience. Having said as such, this is what happened.

It was April 02, 07, around 9:30p, I was on the 408W at about exit 12 or 11. I saw a red light reflecting off the buildings and thought it was funny because of how high up it was, and thought maybe it was some emergency lights. I saw between the two buildings a red, pulsating light that was enveloped in what looked to be a plasma shield. My best way of describing it would be a red blood cell, complete with plasma membrane. I had a funny thought about it, when it turned to it's right and came up very quickly upon me and my minivan which I was currently driving.

This thing proceeded to be about 20-30feet in front and slightly above the van. It was pulsating a deep red and when the little ball would light up the "plasma" would catch the light. I noticed it appeared like a washer inside, as it seemed a 'red light liquid' was washing around an inner 'yellow light liquid' with maybe some white in the very center, as it was very bright inside, liquidy washing around. (so strange)

As I am watching this I realize the "plasma" is.. de-materializing? The center red pulsating ball of light started to spin and stretch and it grew wings. Wings like a plane, in fact, it looked a lot like a drone plane!!(Complete with a silvery finish, and what looked like a cockpit, however there was no 'tail end' to speak of) But...I was driving at a constant speed of 75mph(I don't speed and I had cruise control on), and to make matters more interesting, it was facing me. On each wing tip there was a light, one yellow the other white, blinking on and off back and forth. At the underbelly was the SAME red ball of liquid light, still blinking. It seemed wobbly. The best way to describe it would be if you held a baton at the middle and made figure 8's with your wrist. It would be that motion.

I remember looking back at one point, to see if other cars were around me because I noticed the cars all in front of me had pretty well taken off. I had no luck behind me as well. Not moments later, after looking, a police cruiser with lights flashing but no siren, came up from my left and almost sideswiped my van, coming in between myself and the craft "drone plane look-alike". 

The craft responded to this by veering off to the right and it "grew" for better of lack of a term, a spotlight, that I believe was behind the red light and as it had flown up to this brick building, it shined a light on a window on it. I tried to watch it as it flew away and I kinda wanted it to come back, but I lost sight of it. I lost sight of the police cruiser, too. I kinda really wanted him to pull me over, just so I could talk with someone else about what I'd just seen. Somewhere, that cop is out there, and s/he saw it too.

Ok, sorry for the wall of text, but I thought ya'll might want to hear it. It changed my fucking life. </TEXT>

Fuck that meme, we will prove it wrong thru actions that will become a real meme instead of simply sitting on our asses and making a new "no, we will stay, we promise!" meme. Now get out there! And if you can't, there are plenty of ways to keep the protest real for you. Try having products sent out to the protesters, have pizza's delivered, send ponchos, send blankets, etc etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Lady :) Did he know if you were a virgin or not before he started dating you? It sounds like the church is a big part of his life, and it is interesting that he didn't say anything about it beforehand. Anyways, do you drink? And if you do, is that also an issue for him?

I am really sorry that you have to go thru this btw. I know that's GOTTA suck. Good Luck, whatever you choose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With all the evidence coming forward of the 'seeds of life' as it were being found in asteroids and possible water on Mars, the vastness and HUGENESS of the galaxy, not to mention the age of the freaking universe herself...

I'm just going with they point more and more toward that we cannot only be alone but that there is most likely to be civilizations that are far surpassing us in everything. Not to mention, there is some talk, wish I had the freaking source right now, that says some old life even on earth didn't use O2 the way we do. So... it's just really really likely that we could never have ever been 'alone'. As for ufo's...It's hard to provide strong evidence for what most likely doesn't want to be 'caught' and 'studied'. After all, if you went to a primitive village would you want them to do that to you? (just saying, we are primitive to their tech, hands down) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's pretty hilarious.
In fact it reminded me of this:
I seem to remember as a young woman there was a big emphasis put on how a temple cannot be damaged by nature, only by man. This is because, once blessed, God protected it and those inside of it.  The Kirkland Temple in Ohio got hit by a tornado and so I asked about it. My teachers said it was because it was now 'owned by the reformed LDS that it was no longer under the same blessings'.
Has anyone else heard this? </TEXT>

Maybe someone should put you in a maid outfit with a buttplug and make you clean their home in heels. They can videotape you and tell you how sexy you look while cleaning up. Then, when that is over, they take the buttplug out of you and fuck the shit out of you...cuz um, you sound like a bitter sub. I used to be that way, then I embraced myself  :) </TEXT>

I need to be told what to do and made to feel sexy while being made to be submissive. I could care less about hours of gaming, I'd rather be tied up and have my ass high in the air and spanked.

That will be done to placate or 'shut me up' and then he will never look into dom/sub stuff, he'll never talk about it again until I bring it up, and he will seem bored and unconvinced that he should do it.

I am 100% ok with doing what ever he wants. But that has to end, b/c I ALWAYS do what he wants and the most crazy thing we do is "lets stand and fuck". I'm not kidding. I wish I were.

BTW: It took us a long time and my bff yelling at him to realize that its actually important to get the girl off. Otherwise he would just roll over and sleep and tell me to "finish myself". He's starting to do that again.

As for your wife, I'd say start with small things. Leather paddle maybe, or even some restraints tied to a bed. Just her arms then, if she likes that, you can move to the legs being tied up. You could blindfold her and really go to town haha!! Just make sure she feels safe. That is your number one goal!! Good Luck!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. He refuses to compromise, at all. He simply will not do it. It's so aggrevating I want to tear my nails out sometimes. I can't express how awful it is to bend over on someones lap and tell them "ive been naughty, spank me" and have them nonchalantly push you off them and go back to watching Youtube.
2. I am very focused on sex. That is why I came to r/sex. I feel like my sexual health isn't being exercised, and I wanted to know if what I was feeling was ok or right. What I am finding is my sinking feeling of I need to break up is something that a lot of people would agree with. I'm not being selfish, he is by not even trying. I'm willing to do pretty much anything for him and I think I posted that I've asked what he wants. He wont tell me what he wants. He just...it's like he has almost no libido.

Also, you're right, relationships are more than just sex. But when your being sexually stifled and have 1 libido that is GO at 96% of the time/day or night...and one who is about 5% eh, ok, we can fuck, once a day/every few days/week...I'm sorry, but I can't do it... I've tried like hell for two years... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its hard to not feel selfish. I fought myself for a long time about who I am sexually-speaking. I hated my sub-self. So I hid it, and when I realized thru lots of self exploration, reading, and learning that there is not one thing wrong with me I had to get over that head game. When I expressed it to him, what I wanted he seemed just..non-interested. Like what I need is non-consequential. It's stifling to be told no and that it's you, when really, deep down, I know it's not me. I'm not repressed the way I was, and I can't deal with being in a repressive relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like I have done all I can do. It's up to him and he'd rather roll over and pass out with No stinging the air. There is no play, not one little bit. Maybe I wouldn't desire it so strongly if I could get it out of my system, but it's going to get bad if he doesn't turn around. I will leave him. It's the only fucking recourse here.

Thus comes the whole "find a new guy" crusade, one that does what I need. I hope it's not freaking hardcore to locate!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no problem with eating meat. However, the treatment of said "meat" while in life is, to me, of utmost importance. I'm not saying they get heated floors and mani/pedi's every Saturday morning with a latte.

What I'm saying is I am 100% for ethical treatment of food while it's alive. No matter if it's a dog, cat, rabbit, cow, pig, duck, goose, or fish. It's mind boggling to me that people could feel ok with doing this to something alive. Not to freakin' mention that mammals when living in a stressful and/or unhealthy living conditions release chemicals from the brain that DO NOT EXIT THE BODY. Instead, they build up in the muscle...and what of animals, pray tell, do we eat? The fucking muscles. So what? You might think. Heh... These chemicals don't release from our bodies, either. That means even if going thru the digestive system they can be absorbed into the body and are not passed. This build up of negative emotional chemicals into the body happens in our own lives! Why the fuck would you want to eat something that has been freaking miserable its whole life, knows nothing but misery and has been releasing this chemical into it's muscles and then YOU and your Family ingest this meat. Maybe, just maybe, the reason so many people are on things like Prozac or Zoloft might actually stem from the living conditions and overall mental soundness of the freaking meat we are eating.

Ok. Sorry to write all of that, I was going to make a short comment and that just blurted out of me. I feel very passionate about this idea of mine and I really do feel that it does matter what you eat and how it was handled in life. In fact, if you have ever gotten meat from farmers who have clean pastures and feed their, say, cattle with grains, oats, molasses and not just soley corn, you know you can taste the difference. And I also feel good after I eat it, not like the feeling you get from McD's or even most store bought meat.

<TEXT> I never felt like it was bad., but it was never really impressed upon me, either. I can absolutely see this as something the women will only share with the bishop and feel absolute inner guilt that something that feels amazing is demonized and "satan is within you, controlling you". I feel lucky in that way...however, I was incredibly sheltered from all things sexual so for the most part I really didn't know I was even engaging in masturbation(i didn't exactly touch myself so it wasn't the same, right?!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So... I had no idea about this til today. I am very disgusted about the level the church steeps down to in regards to masturbation, especially to the priesthood. And for what? To instill in these youth/men that there is something wrong with them, that they are addicts to porn and masturbation. Wow.
So,..I did a little digging because I was curious and found this :)

<TEXT> No, no, you are right, I am indeed bitching. Also, I am not a "sir", heh. I just, I'm new here and I don't get how all the hating of theists is really any different from the hatred coming out of the Westborough Church. While the Westborough Church'll say god(who doesn't exist) hates you and is glad that our soldiers died, it's really not that different from how Atheists I see on here act toward religion/religious people.
And while I don't believe the shit they spew at churches, I do find that most religious people are generally nice if you don't tell your views. In fact, lots of people who are religious don't even really discuss it, they show they are "good christians" through their actions of charity and kindness. While maybe it's only b/c they think the flying spaghetti monster is always watching, it's a helluva lot nicer than sitting in a room of Atheists who are bitching about the theists. I dunno, maybe the poster above you is right about the "anti-theists". I'm not an angry atheist, and I'm not trying to push anything on anyone. I kinda like people to be, oh happy, and not oh, try to make others feel badly for what they think. :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's nice to see that part of your good day was to make her feel bad... i am an atheist but it really pisses me off when atheists get off on making theists feel terrible about how they feel. if they aren't pushing their irrationality on you, leave it alone.
...consider the football player that always wears the same socks for a game, he thinks it makes him always win when he wears them, but doesn't tell anyone. he never hurt a single person due to his irrational thought and didn't press it upon his teammates to do something similar, and why would you make that football player feel bad about the socks he wears? same goes true for religion. however-if they are pressing their religion on you by all means talk with them about your viewpoints and don't agree with them, but for fuck's sake making people feel bad and being happy about that later, that's fucking sick and it's sadistic. goddamn atheists have a better than thou or smarter than thou attitude ... and you wonder why ppl hate you so much? think about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just went to PP for the first time yesterday. Thank you for working there. I am saddened that there is so much controversy over such an important service for women. The people who work there are not monsters, they are giving women a choice, a choice to keep themselves healthy and prepared. If it weren't for PP, so many home abortions would occur which are incredibly dangerous. I don't comprehend the negativity surrounding this, it's primarily for the safety of women and the choice is there's. BTW, PP is not just about abortion, but for many religious groups that is all they think about. Once again thank you and I hope your funding doesn't get cut. </TEXT>
