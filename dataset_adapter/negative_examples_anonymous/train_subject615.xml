<DATE> 2014-09-22 15:53:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Finally the day has come: The Big Bang Theory premieres its 8th season with not one, but two episodes! What will happen to Sheldon this season, where did he go? When will he return. We know as much as the official synopsis tells us


In the Season 8 premiere (The Locomotion Interruption), Amy and Leonard take a surprise road trip to Arizona to retrieve Sheldon, while Penny goes on a job interview at Bernadettes company, and Howard has problems wrapping his head around Stuarts relationship with Mrs. Wolowitz.

TBBT S08E02 ( The Junior Professor Solution) finds Sheldon who is ordered to teach a class, and the gang is surprised when Howard signs up to take it; and tensions between Penny and Bernadette afford Amy an opportunity to play one against the other.

The Big Bang Theory airs from 8 to 9 pm on CBS. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-08-25 05:13:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It seems like vampires would have the ability to give people back the memories theyve blocked I dont like that Hoyt didnt get to remember he and Jasons youth together, but then he seems more confident then he did before. Hmm

And why make it seem as though Bill was possibly turning into a Human again?

Why make Eric interesting and compassionate to others; not only to those hes in love with or made, in the last two episodes more than the whole series?

That Bridgette bitch had 0 right to be angry with Hoyt because the moment she set eyes on Jason her eyes bugged the fuck out and she was mind fucking him the whole time. And she cheated? Thats her biggest darkest secret? She cheated on a test? For a biologist she lacked a lot of depth. Jason deserved better.

And while I despise Sarah Newlin she was quite a character, Im disappointed with what they did with her, I wish Pam would have taken her up on her offer and then opened a vampire girl brothel or something. I think Sarah would have just changed her identity again and loved her new life.

Glad Arlene still had her new man though!

Favorite part of the whole series: When Eric finally gave a piece to Ginger </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opionion not every character needs to have a romantic side...some just need to be `doers`..or maybe that`s the way the writers wanted to build daryl`s character, so that later we will be happy when he gets involved with someone (female or not) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, many people have their theories.
My guesses are:
Victoria Argent and The warden at Eichen House

This list has narrowed as the season continued, but I feel like these are strong candidates.

Care to share your theories?

<TEXT> Sam Trammell wasnt even in this episode. I think this may be the first episode that he ever missed on the show. Its such a waste of the character and all because of how some fans responded to him in the last book. I guess if the fans wanted Sam to be a random stranger who had no connection to Sookie, thats exactly what True Blood now turned him into. Sam Merlotte was Merlottesthe living pulse of Bon Temps. Now I dont know what he is. This just makes me sad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> `The Knick' is a look at the professional and personal lives of the staff at New York's Knickerbocker Hospital during the early part of the twentieth century.

I think it`s a pretty good show if you dont mind blood and such. I totally buy Clive Owen as an asshole surgeon. The music is pretty awesome as well and I appreciate the setting and time in history a lot.

Have you seen it yet? What are your thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, can I just say how bad ass spencer was tonight, not taking no for an answer. Im so glad that aria apologized to Hannah and they made up. As for mama Montgomery, I feel so bad for her, she just can catch a break. I swear if tonight wasnt foreshadowing a twin theory, then its not going to happen at all. I believe Noel when he says that Alison was never kidnapped. When he says that our friend likes to through away people when shes done using them I think hes referring to A. So if this is true, is A a woman. Im so proud of Hanna for ditching the booze and I have to say it was hot when Caleb stood up for his girl. I love Travis but haleb is growing on me again. I still dont trust Alison and highly doubt that she even knows this guy in custody. We will soon see.

<TEXT> Its so obvious Hanna hates Ali. She is avoiding her big time! Im telling youHanna joined Mona. She cant face her. Shes drinking and stressed because shes afraid the girls might find out.
    Rhonda is so cute with her root beer and crunchy cheese doodles.
    I think E. Lamb was fired and pushed out of town by A.
    Poor Ella. I have a feeling they moved the wedding up because she got pregnant. Zach is an Asshole!!!!
    Did Sydney slip up on purpose about NY or by accident. (Id love to hear your thoughts on this!)
    I want to hear what everyone thinks about Alis behavior. All fake?
    I was shocked it was Noel who broke in the Marins house! When Ali first blurted his name out i had a heart attacki thought she was going to say he was A or something tp do with A!!
    Just a side thought..didnt Mona also ride horses? Remember she went with Kate and her friend when Hanna went? 

Thats all i have. Any comments?  </TEXT>
