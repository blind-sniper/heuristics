<TEXT>  Pixar movies have always done that. Cartoonish characters on realistic backgrounds. 

But there is something about the background here in "The Good Dinosaur" that seems more real than it usually does. When you look at the trees, grass, water, mountains, and everything else it looks so much more real than it usually does in a Pixar movie. I mean not even the coral reef in Finding Nemo looked as real as the background in this trailer did (at least in my opinion). The contrast with this real background compared to the dinosaur really bothered me. Maybe the lack of dialog had me focusing on the background more than usual, or maybe it was the fact that the dinosaur is so cartoonish that he seemed out of place. I don't know. 

Other than that I liked the trailer. No plot given away, just music and scenes of a (possible?) budding friendship. It actually made me more interested in the movie.

<TEXT> I had no idea that Canada was such a terrorist hot spot. His father is from Jordan so he likely went (possibly under the ruse) to see extended family and then snuck into nearby Syria or Iraq (this is of course assuming that the guy carried this out in the name of radical Islam, while all initial signs point to that there is still no statement from the FBI on why he did this). Also Jordan is one of the U.S.'s allies in the Middle East, it isn't crawling with terrorist groups like Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq so visiting there wouldn't raise any red flags.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know, unfortunately the GOP has run a successful union busting ring here for the past 50 years. The regional airlines here are separate companies that use non union pilots and are contracted out by the big 3 airlines (Delta, United, and American) to fly smaller planes ([40 to 80 seat planes like this](http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acimages/crj700er_kp.jpg)) from their hubs to small cities, think Chicago to Green Bay. They are staffed by pilots just out of flight school so they are desperate to get their "dream job" and go to work for regional airlines because the larger ones won't hire you out of flight school. The regional airlines know that they don't have to pay a high salary because there are plenty of eager pilots in line to get a job. In a perfect world you spend a few years flying for a regional airline then get hired by the Delta's, United's, Southwest's and JetBlue's of the world. But that doesn't always happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are probably employed by a company called Veritas that AT T hired to do door to door sales for them. I know this because I applied for a "Management Trainee" job at that company a few months back. I went to the initial interview and was invited back for a 7 hour "day in the life" event to see how the company operatives and was told it would be business professional. Get there having no clue what to expect. Told to go with this guy and  this girl (the girl had only been there a week). It quickly became clear what this job really was. I felt like an absolute idiot for not picking up on the red flags sooner, I had just graduated college so I was desperate and didn't think. So here I was walking around the poor/lower middle class part Akworth in dress shoes and a suit all day in the May sun sweating my ass off doing nothing but watching these people try to sell AT T U-verse to people who can't afford it. The whole thing was BS. The guy even said to the new girl "don't sell the cheap package sell the expensive one". And the whole spiel they gave to people was complete BS too.  Like you said, given a huge list of addresses in a certain area and have to cover it multiple times to make sure you catch the person.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are also in the process of budget tightening. They have lots of personalities contract's coming up this year, so it's all about choosing who is worth paying.

FWIW they have already resigned Stephen A. Smith to a new contract.

<TEXT> The Duggars are huge anti-gay bigots. They were instrumental in getting an LGBT non-discrimination ordinance in Fayetteville, Arkansas repealed last year. They said that Trans people were child molesters, which is ironic since their son was a child molester.

<TEXT> I worked in the dinning hall my freshman year. The catered food was better than the stuff they gave the students (though not by much). There was one time I was told the cut beef so I went back and grabbed some. But it was the steak that they serve to catered events. I was told to put it pack and get the proper meat for the students, which was like 15 pounds of solid meat with about 6 pounds of it being fat. I had to cut all the fat off before I could even start cutting the meat that was on there </TEXT>

But I do agree that I don't see nbc signing on with an exclusive B1G contract as football games in the fall would probably interfere with their EPL and nascar coverage . Now if it's a shared package (ala the pac 12 with ESPN and Fox) then NBC might sign on </TEXT>

<TEXT> The NCAA doesn't let any tournament events go on in South Carolina or Mississippi because of their embrace of the confederate flag. This has been official policy since 1999. Since then SC has added major production facilities for BMW and Boeing and just announced a new plant for Volvo (even Mississippi has added a production facility for Toyota), and Gov. Nikki Haley has said that no CEOs have mentioned the flag to her as a problem. I don't see anything changing in the future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't need to be banned. It just shouldn't be flown on the lawn of the South Carolina legislature. There is too much baggage associated with the flag. If you think it's "southern pride" then fly it on your own property. That flag was flown by traitors who rebelled against the US government. No state should embrace that flag 

[(this applies to Mississippi as well)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mississippi)

Note: Born and raised in Georgia and always associated that flag with racism.

<TEXT> I'm with you. This is a great plan. The neighborhoods in that area are , lets be honest, shit. It's empty lots and abandoned houses. This is literally the best plan to replace Turner Field. Much better than imploding the stadium and leaving it an empty lot (as if the area needed another one of those). Plus this will bring actual development to the area, something that the baseball stadium never did.

<TEXT> NBC has shown Olympics coverage in the past on NBCSN, Bravo, CNBC, msnbc, USA, and Oxygen. Actually NBCUniversal owns more channels than ESPN. If NBC wanted to they could also show Olympics coverage on E!, The Weather Channel, Golf Channel, Esquire Network, Chiller, Cloo, and syfy. So it's not lack of channels that's the problem, its the lack of will on NBC's part. Now maybe with the success of their live premier league games and live ice skating coverage during the Olympics last year they will change. But I'm not too confident.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> NBC almost got the Pac-12 contract but ESPN didn't want to give it away and was willing to swallow their pride and co-bid with Fox. NBCSN also bid on The American contract and ESPN outbid again. ESPN doesn't want to give NBCSN a foot in the door. Also ESPN won't sub-license games to them. It isn't in ESPN's interest to give NBCSN programing. ESPN doesn't mind giving CBSSN or FSN some games because they aren't a threat to them. Most conferences are signed to long term deals. The only conference whose contract is up soon is the B1G. You can bet your ass that ESPN won't give that up (plus Fox might make a play as well).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes but so far in everything that has come out Blatter hasn't been indicated. On top of that this is a man who has shown that he doesn't give a damn about PR or the press. This is also a man who I believe is smart enough to not get his hands dirty and leave it up to his lieutenants. So again the question is why resign now?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never claimed that cutting taxes are to be blamed for falling oil prices, I have no idea where you get that idea. The only thing I cited was that the tax cuts made things bad, low oil prices (a completely different issue from govt funding) made things worse because it means lower revenue than what they would have had if the prices were higher. To be clear low taxes didn't cause low oil prices, and I never claimed as such. Low taxes on high oil prices brings in more revenue than low taxes on low oil prices, that is it. Also I never said that there can't be cuts, my issue is that so much has already been cut how much is there left? 


also I never laid all the blame on low taxes, I lay the majority of the blame </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well that isn't because of a tax cut, is it? I mean, can you show me how LA tax cuts have cratered the world wide price of oil? If not, then placing all the blame on taxes is just silly.

Of course falling oil prices aren't because of taxes. The point is that Jindal was banking on high oil prices to help the state out of the huge hole they put themselves in and didn't have a plan B just in case. 

Again, raising taxes is only one option/tool there. The other option/tool is to address the spending that has increased $2B from 2012 to 2014.The fact that they choose not to question the spending side of the equation doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it is automatically all because of less taxes.Call me crazy, but I doubt that the tax increases somehow magically caused spending to rise by $2B in 2 years, but I'm happy to look at what you've got.

First this statement doesn't make any sense to me. The state is in a $1.6B budget gap, you don't get that way by just increasing spending you get that way by cutting revenue as well. You can't get out of this mess by just cutting everything, you need to raise revenue as well. If you cut everything you end up with shitty road, schools, government services etc. You keep sighting this $2B and yet I can find that figure in the document you provided in another comment (could you at least cite a page or pages, I don't have time to read a 120pg document). Also how could tax increases cause spending to rise? More to the point they didn't raise taxes at all, they cut them or let them stay as is. This contributed to the mess they are in.

<TEXT>  Year after year, Louisiana didn't have enough money to cover its expenses, yet Gov. Bobby Jindal refused to roll back income tax cuts or ever-increasing corporate tax breaks. Instead, he raided reserve funds and sold off state property.Jindal suggested job growth from his economic development wins would replenish those assets once the recession ended. It hasn't  and money from the lucrative oil industry has taken a nose dive with crude prices. Now, the Republican is running out of short-term patches and is struggling to plug a $1.6 billion budget hole just as he tries to build support for a possible 2016 presidential run.

[source: The (Baton Rouge) Advocate ](http://theadvocate.com/news/11576704-123/out-of-tricks-how-louisiana) 

Most blame the $1.6 billion budget gap on Jindals rigid refusal to raise taxes, which originates in a pledge he signed with Grover Norquist, sultan of the GOPs anti-tax wing. For years, Jindal has been siphoning money from dedicated funds or one-time payouts to make up for the states lack of revenue.Now, even members of his own party are criticizing him for his management of Louisianas finances.

<TEXT> It is a title loan place. 
In the United States, a car title loan, also called an auto title loan, vehicle title loan, pink slip loan, or simply title loan, is a type of secured loan where the borrower can use their vehicle title as collateral. Borrowers who get title loans must allow a lender to place a lien on their car title, and temporarily surrender the hard copy of their vehicle title, in exchange for a loan amount. When the loan is repaid, the lien is removed and the car title is returned to its owner. If the borrower defaults on their payments then the lender is liable to repossess the vehicle and sell it to repay the borrowers outstanding debt.

<TEXT> The Chattahoochee River is damed in North Georgia (Lake Lanier) and is a vital supply of drinking water for the Atlanta area. Naturally Georgia doesn't like to let too much water out because we need it. However Alabama and Florida also claim the water, and would like more released for their own needs. Alabama needs it for its nuclear power plants along the Chattahoochee.  Florida needs lots of water because the more water released from Lake Lanier the more rich nutrients are realized that shrimp feed on at the mouth of the river in the Gulf of Mexico. These shrimp are an important part of the fishing industry there. Without the nutrients the shrimp population suffers and so does the fishing industry.  </TEXT>

If you look at the economics surrounding the show and the market (Marquette, MI ) you understand. The station is the 180th TV market (out of 210) so the station isn't making bang by any means do to its small viewing audience. On top of that the station has gone through multiple owners who have had no interest in investing in the station at all. It's actually a miracle that it lasted this long and it is unlikely that the show will continue without him.

<TEXT> You think it should be legal and accepted part of society that businesses can discriminate against black and gay people. So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them. Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people, discriminate against people, or poison the environment along the way so be it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I can't find the damn thing how can I make my point. Also I guarantee you haven't read the thing either since the thing is impossible to find online. It's almost like the state of Indiana doesn't want the public to see it. If they didn't want discrimination all Indiana had to do was be like other states and add a provision into the law saying that no one could use this law to discriminate against other people. That fact tell me right there that your politicians don't care about "religious liberty" but are instead a bunch of homophobic bigots. Also the fact that they made this law now after gay marriage became legal says a lot, if this was so important they could have done this 10 years ago when being a bigot was in-vogue. And no one who didn't support this bill would be defending it as hard as you have been on this thread.  </TEXT>

Its easy for MARTA to come in and simply  replace it. Public transportation is universal, there is nothing that makes it special. It's bus and rail, that's it. CCT and GCT are not special. Funding might be a little different but again nothing stoping Cobb and Gwinnett from joining MARTA. Also the best public transportation systems are large ones that serve the whole region, not a peace meal of regional ones. Looks at the systems in San Francisco, Botson, and Washington dc.

<TEXT> You are failing to recognize that C-Tran was shut down during the worst of the recision when the economy was literally in free fall and governments were slashing everything. With an improved economy there is a chance that Clayton County will be able to contribute enough revenue to MARTA in order to make the whole thing worth while. But regardless I highly doubt that Fulton and Dekalb contribute an equal amount to MARTA funding. If Fulton contributed more than Dekalb you could make the argument that Fulton is subsidizing Dekalb (or vise versa if Dekalb contributed more) so I still don't see what your argument is </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a few of the season on DVD and while Seinfeld is a hilarious show I don't think if lends itself to binge watching. When you watch the episodes back to back you realize just how ludicrous the show is and how unlikeable/ridiculous the characters are. Many would say "that's the brilliance/joke/point of the show". While this is true I honestly believe that it's best in small doses, otherwise it gets tiring.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here is a local news story about the videos](http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4766966/) 

Apparently the bridge is old and is owned by the railroad company (Norfolk Southern) and that the state DOT can't do anything that hasn't already been done. Replacing the bridge and raising the tracks would be extremely expensive, something that Norfolk Southern and the state probably don't want to pay for, so they are comfortable with the low bridge that averages 10 crashes a year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> why its bad 

It allows people to use their religion to challenge or opt out of various laws - including local laws in Atlanta and other cities - that protect LGBT people and other minorities from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. In practical terms, S.B. 129 could allow businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, a paramedic to refuse to provide life-saving services to an LGBT person, or a school counselor to refuse services to an LGBT teenager. The bill puts minority groups at risk of being denied service everywhere from the convenience store to the doctors office.

<TEXT> You don't think it's good, but you think it should be legal and accepted part of society. So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them.  Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people or poison the environment along the way so be it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me start out by saying I'm and atheist and hate organized religion. That may add some biased to me when it comes to certain religion affiliated schools (though schools with loose affiliations like TCU and Wake Forest I have less problems with). Let me also state that this hatred of religion comes from me being gay and all churches rejection of me as a human being. 

BU's policy on gays is absolutely stupid. The fact that the ban on gays and gay sex is still in place in 2015 is deplorable. Kids at college age should not be told by their church, much less their school, that they are not welcome on this earth because of the way that they were born. [Brittney Griner's criticism is pretty good at explaining this](http://deadspin.com/brittney-griner-says-baylor-wasnt-a-good-place-to-be-ga-1563484030).  (Also Fox News is not moderately crazy, they are bat shit insane. )

That is my viewpoint about Baylor and the Baptist Church. It might not seem like an unbiased opinion but it's my opinion. As long as Baylor is tied to the Baptist Church I will continue to view it in this light.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today 5 more counties started offering gay marriage licenses after not doing so yesterday. 

Also it sounds like the governor has a sound head on his shoulders (never thought I would say that of an Alabama politician). 
It is important for people across the country to know that the governor of Alabama today is not the governor of Alabama 50 years ago. 

**and**

I dont want Alabama to be seen as it was 50 years ago when a federal law was defied. Im not going to do that, Im trying to move this state forward.

Of note: It is the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma in about 3 weeks, I think this is fresh on his and other Alabamans minds right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also top voted comment on the article is as follows 


**Thomas:**
I walked into his chambers and could feel his steely eyes staring me down. His imposing figure loomed over me as I pressed my back against the wall. Roy dropped his judicial robes to the floor to reveal his well maintained body in all of its glory. His firm member showed a passion. It betrayed by his stone faced expression.
"I always wondered if you wore anything while you were on the bench..." I whispered.
"Shut up" Roy said as he advanced. He grabbed my shoulders forcefully and spun me around, bending me over his large mahogany desk. He drove himself into me from behind causing me to help slightly as I gripped the papers on his desk, moving them from the orderly piles there to be clenched in a fit of pain and passion.
"Oh, Roy!" I called out. "Shut up, Tommy" he insisted through gritted teeth.
Such was my first time.

**Response from Gary:** 
pervert

**Thomas reply:** 
Just when I thought my body could take no more, as I gasped and panted on the verge of collapse, Gary came in wearing a tight, wet T-shirt with a grin on his face.
"No, I can't..."I sputtered.
"You can." Roy said firmly.
"And you will." Gary said.
I lay back, ready to take whatever fate had brought me.
It was like kissing God.

**Gary again:** 
I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future.

**Thomas reply:**
"I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future." Gary said as he forced himself into my mouth. He arched his back as he did so before looking back down to me. "Now accept thy Lord..."

edit: For those that don't want to give the site clicks the headline is all you really need, also he said this on his facebook page so this is not an "official" order yet. It should also be noted the the governor said yesterday that he would not seek charges against judges who issue marriage licenses to gay couples. So once again Moore is alone in this fight.

Mom has no interest in her school's team (Clemson) and Dad is an extremely jaded UVA fan because of their struggles over the last 15 years so it was hard for me to be a fan of either of them because I was never exposed to them when I was young. So I just latched onto the two big schools here. </TEXT>

And while I'm at it Chick-fil-A is just average fast food, people around here treat it like gospel

<TEXT> I haven't been to that many games involving my teams, the worst experience that I can remember having is at the peach bowl (it was either 2002 or 2004). We live in the Atlanta area and my dad gets tickets through work every year to the game. So we usually don't have a stake in either team. We had some extra tickets and their was this family of Tennessee fans that needed tickets. My mom was like "oh they look like a nice clean cut family, why don't we sell our extra tickets to them". We did and they were so thankful, get to are seats in the Dome and they are right next to us. Well the moment the game starts these people turn into the most obnoxious drunk fans I have ever experienced. They were shouting so much that the people in front of us had to ask them to shut up because they were shouting right into their ears. The last straw was when the wife spilt beer on the guy in front of her, security was called and they were escorted out. We have never sold extra tickets to anyone since.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not trying to trivialize the issue, what I'm criticizing is that the NFL is all of a sudden caring about this issue and saying that they are going to do more and donate money to charities. When in reality  they are spending so little on domestic violence considering they make $10 billon a year. I'm also criticizing the fact that they partnered with NOmore, an organization that is not a nonprofit and is completely fake seeming to only be for branding http://deadspin.com/do-the-nfls-anti-domestic-violence-initiatives-actually-1682681513 </TEXT>

The most activity that I do with my friends is have lunch. So I'm still kinda a "shut in" but I am more active now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Freshman year of college every Friday and Saturday evening I would order a pizza (or some other type of takeout food) and take my laptop into the study room in my dorm and just sit there and watch Netflix until about 2am while everyone else in the dorm was either hanging out or throwing parties. It was quite common for me to have to wear headphones just so I could hear because of all of the noise from people having fun. I would always make sure that my roommate was asleep before I went back into the room (he was a stoner and a party animal so this is why I didn't want to be in that room). The way that I would make sure that he was asleep is that I would go outside the building and look to see if the light was on in our room. Once it was out I would finally be able to go get some sleep. This went on my entire freshman year. </TEXT>

But some families were upset that the government decided on the fate of their loved ones without any concrete evidence.

In China, some family members refused to accept the official position that the plane was lost.
"They have found nothing," said Li Jingxin whose brother is missing.
"With nothing found, how can they make any announcement?''

<TEXT> That's why he was fired. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer,says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights is funding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now. So don't believe anything the American Family Association says about them not standing for what Bryan says. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow does a great breakdown of the whole affair http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843 (the video in the link wouldn't work for me)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The video in the link wasn't working for me so I'll post the video from the MSNBC website [here](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843), it is worth watching. 

TL;DR 

He wasn't fired because he was an anti-gay, racist, sexist, bigot. He was fired because the American Family Association is founding a trip to Israel for over 50 GOP members, including the party chair Reince Priebus. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer, says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights founding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now.

Roy Moore is a big time Christian. Before he was on the Alabama Supreme Court he opened all his cases with a prayer. He called on Alabama to use it's powers to punish "homosexual behavior". He famously put a ten commandments statue in the Alabama Supreme Court building in 2002. He was taken to court by secular groups and they got a federal court to order it's removal. He refused and was subsequently removed from the court by a judicial oversight board. Alabamans reelected him to his former position in 2012 </TEXT>

Seeing as you make only $30,000 a year (as you state in a post here:np.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/2mybbb/an_open_letter_to_reddit_liberals_from_a_reddit/) you already don't pay that much in taxes as you fall into a low tax bracket. I am advocating the abolition of super PACs and a limit on the amount of money you can give campaigns. What I would do first is say that money is not free speech, abolish super PACs, and say that corporations could not donate to candidates campaigns. People could still donate to political parties and candidates but it would only be $500 max. Then what I would do is close corporate tax loopholes and capital gains loopholes and use some (like maybe 6%) available for campaigns to dip into if they want, split evenly of course (by the way those taxes wouldn't affect you). </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Freshman year of college every Friday and Saturday evening I would order a pizza (or some other type of takeout food) and take my laptop into the study room in my dorm and just sit there and watch Netflix until about 2am while everyone else in the dorm was either hanging out or throwing parties. It was quite common for me to have to wear headphones just so I could hear because of all of the noise from people having fun. I would always make sure that my roommate was asleep before I went back into the room (he was a stoner and a party animal so this is why I didn't want to be in that room). The way that I would make sure that he was asleep is that I would go outside the building and look to see if the light was on in our room. Once it was out I would finally be able to go get some sleep. This went on my entire freshman year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ted hasn't owned the team for about 19 years. When he sold Turner Broadcasting to TimeWarner in 1996 they got the Braves as part of the deal. TimeWarner sold the Braves to Liberty Media, a holding company controlled by John C. Malone, in 2006/2007. The Braves signed a TV deal about 5/7 years back with FOX Sports South/SportSouth, two regional sports networks owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (formally News Corp). The deal was for 20 years and pays only $15 million a year. For comparison the San Diego Padres signed a contract 3 years later for $40 million a years and the Texas Rangers signed a contract 2 years later for $80 million a year. Logically if the Braves TV contract were on the open market today it could fetch somewhere between those numbers if not more. So yeah the Braves have a shitty TV contract that they are stuck with until the late 2020s.  </TEXT>

What is most damning, for me, is that Paterno convinced Schultz, Spanier, and Curley to NOT go to police. After the other 3 resolved to go to Department of Welfare, Paterno convinced them NOT to do that. That is horrible.

"According to CNN in an email dated Feb. 26, 2001, Schultz wrote to Curley about a three-part plan that included talking "with the subject asap regarding the future appropriate use of the University facility,"  "contacting the chair of the charitable organization" and "contacting the Department of Welfare."
Former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley's alleged email could be damaging for Joe Paterno. (AP) It would have been better to skip directly to the third action and let the welfare authorities do the meeting and informing, but this should've been enough to end Sandusky's reign of terror. Except that Curley sent an email to Schultz and school president Graham Spanier on Feb. 27, 2001, that changed everything.
"After giving it more thought and talking it over with Joe yesterday, I am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps. I am having trouble with going to everyone but the person involved. I would be more comfortable meeting with the person and tell them about the information we received and tell them we are aware of the first situation," Curley's email said

<TEXT> Southerner here who's actually been to France. I would say that what most people here say is true. The NE is more densely populated and has better flight connections to Europe that the Southern, Midwestern, or Western part of the country. It also helps that NYC is a huge financial center and Washington is the political center of the country. Also like someone else said people out west may have a stronger connection to Asia and people in the southwest have a stronger connection to Latin America.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gas taxes are used to fund infrastructure projects like roads   bridges. The federal gas tax hasn't been raised in 20 years and because of that funds are getting harder to come by. With the chances of a federal gas tax increase being almost 0, states are looking at the possibility of raising gas taxes on their own. The low price of gas at the moment makes it more palatable to raise the tax now than it was when oil was $100 a barrel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fellow American here and I totally agree with you. Before going to France  all I heard about were how rude the French were. I personally never experienced that. Granted the school group I was with stayed in more of the touristy areas so there were more english speakers (and one could argue that they were putting on happy faces for tourists). However there were a few times that we were not in tourist areas.  The locals may not have spoken much english but we made the effort to speak French when ordering something or asking questions which they seemed to appreciate.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Am I the only one here who think that this is wrong and that Penn St should not have the wins restored. I'm sick and tired of Penn St and Paterno fans acting like they were the victims here. The victims were the KIDS that Sandusky RAPED while Penn St turned a blind eye. Did the NCAA overstep? Possibly but guess what the NCAA makes up the rules as they go along. The NCAA is a dick to everyone (just look at USC) why should Penn St get special treatment when everyone else is punished to the fullest extent. </TEXT>

I think insects is self explanatory. I DON'T LIKE BUGS. Orcas..... I don't know why I don't like them. Maybe I'm just more of a fur guy and I have a hard time imagining them as anthros - same with birds probably.
