<DATE> 2015-06-24 11:06:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings fellow Wrangloids. So I have recently become the proud owner of an awesome new bad-ass mobile, it is in desperate need of new tyres though as they are as bald as a....well you see where I'm going with this!

My question is this: how can i find out what dimension of tyres I can get. I want to get some nice big dirty off-road muddies on there, I am unsure if they will fit the wheels though. My model is a 1997 Wrangler TJ Sport 4.0 with standard wheels but can't find anywhere any information on what tyres will fit them. Is it necessary to fit new rims also? I realise obviously this depends what tyres I want to put on there, I need to know the size of the wheels before I start shopping though. Any advice would be gratefully received! 

Edit: Forgot to mention, the Mobile Command Unit has a 2" suspension lift, so it will be able to fit larger tyres no problem </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 'Interstellar' when they leave Earth it take the full mite of a Saturn V rocket to get them out of the gravity well and into LEO. However, when they reach Miller's planet, which has much stronger gravity and therefore a much deeper gravity well, they blast off into space using nothing more than a landing craft with relative ease! Also, seeing how a year on Miller's planet is approximately 61,000 Earth years, how did they logically think going there was a good idea?

They took such care to be scientifically accurate and forgot common sense. Otherwise great film! </TEXT>

What is unusual about it is, though it is a soft top, I noticed no distinct increase in road noise (most soft tops become deafening at speed). I can drive down at top speed and still easily hold a conversation or listen to my music. The fit is great and, most important, it looks badass as hell! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Certainly. The Saturn V rocket was, at the time, the most complex and expensive object ever created or even dreamed of by man. NASA built 15 of them (in various forms), costing billions upon billions. Even had a Saturn V never flown, the rocket is undoubtably able to take off from Earth with a specific payload and land on the moon, it was its entire purpose. Would NASA (and ergo the U.S. Government) spend billions in developing and building these most complex machines ever devised, simply to not use it in an elaborate hoax? I think not. A total of 9 Saturn V rockets, carrying three astronauts each took off from Earth and travelled to the moon, this much is indisputable, millions watched each launch, and if the command modules didn't leave Low Earth Orbit then where do they go? Hide behind a cloud? Remember, the soviets were monitoring Americas moon mission and were aware the Americans were leaving LEO.

Next evidence is what the astronauts left on the moon. Using extremely powerful telescopes and satellites the Apollo landing sites are visible, each has been photographed, some being so clear as to show the astronauts footprints and even the trails from the lunar rover. I'm using a mobile device so can't link, but a Google search will find the pictures. Also Apollo 11 left two key instruments on the moon, the first being a seismic meter used to measure activity on the moon (which was used to register key impacts on the moon from artificial objects and meteors). The other were large mirrors which, when a lazar is directed at, measures extremely accurately the distance from the earth to the moon. With the right equipment anyone can perform this experiment thanks to the equipment left on the lunar surface.

Don't forget also that each successful moon landing didn't leave empty-handed. A great deal of samples were returned to Earth, greatly increasing our knowledge and understanding of the moons origins.

Also, space travel was and is an exceptionally dangerous endeavour. Right at the outset 3 Americans, the crew or Apollo 1, lost their lives in a launchpad fire. The crew of Apollo 13 came a hairs breadth from total calamity, 2 space shuttle crews have been lost since the Apollo era. Would men risk and lose their lives for a hoax to achieve a vague "up yours" to the soviets?

Finally, a rough estimate tells us that approximately half a million people were involved in some level in landing men on the moon. If the landings were faked, that is a lot of people to swear to silence...

These are just samples of evidence for the moon landings, arguments proving we went can fill books, and have!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bucking against censorship is taking a stand for free speech. By all means allow good, practicing and peaceful Muslims to abstain from depicting their profit, or any human depiction, but by no means should they or we expect or accept followers of other faiths or non-believers to be bound by their rules. The fight against censorship, be it at a huge scale level such as censorship of the press, or a macro level such as an anonymous redditor, is something that affects us all.

So yes, this is a good thing. Yes, it is important to stand against censorship, and to declare yourself apposed to intimidation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I am aware it is for sanitary reasons, the logic being that to cremate a person with an extremely infectious disease such as Leprosy runs the risk of the disease becoming airborn and a hazard to those working in the Burning Ghats. Of course the logic is flawed as to weigh the body and sink it becomes a hazard just as much for bathers and those further down the river. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Ganges is one of, if not the, most polluted rivers in the world. Anyone who has been to Varinasi and seen the Burning Ghats can testify to that. Bodies, thousands every day, are burned by the river with tons of human remains going into the water. Varinasi is considered a holy place to die in Hinduism, meaning hospices along the river are full to bursting with sufferers of disease or fatal injury. Leprosy is particularly prevalent. To their credit the Hindus will not cremate those who have died from infectious disease, instead the are weighed down, along with children who have died below a certain age and therefor cannot be cremated and holy animals like cows or Cobras, and sunk into the Ganges. All this happens within feet of bathers.

The Ganges is horrifically polluted and to come within contact with it in Varinasi is to take a very serious risk. Thousands do it, and thousands become seriously ill. When I was there I learned of a hotel that had been washing it's plates in tap water from the Ganges, resulting in several guests becoming extremely ill and requiring repatriation. A lot is made of its unusual qualities and so on, this however is a collage of myth and legend. Besides which, with water as polluted and rife with human and animal remains as well as industrial and chemical pollution as this, you would expect it show something unusual when examined. 

TL:DR - don't buy into the hype. You wouldn't want to touch a drop of the Ganges with your worst enemies finger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The shortcut through the Corn field

tempts you as you're walking home,

the clouds above keep the moon concealed

as you enter the swaying corn, alone.

 -

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy,

it grows in rows without scope or end

and in the dark, you hurry.

 -

You don't see the standing forms

as you pass them on your way,

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay.

 -

Hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all,

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall.

 -

You tell yourself as you continue through

"It's merely the rustling of the leaves,"

but they see you, and they hear you,

And they might not let you leave. </TEXT>

 -

The shortcut through the Corn field

tempts you as you're walking home

the clouds above keep the moon concealed

As you enter the swaying corn, alone.

 -

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy

it grows in rows without scope or end

and in the dark, you hurry

 -

You don't see the standing forms

As you pass them on your way

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay

 -

hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall

 -

You tell yourself as you continue through

"Its merely the rustling of the leaves,"

But they see you, and they hear you,

And they might not let you leave.

<TEXT> A movie that I think deserves more acclaim than it received is the biopic film 'Ali'. In particular the closing scene, depicting 'The Rumble in The Jungle' boxing match between Ali and Foreman, in particular the seminal 8th round. The direction is superb, each cut to a new angle progressing the narrative: from Ali seeming to cower behind his gloves to the sudden fury that sent Foreman to the canvas, all the while subtly hinting to early scenes and Ali's early presence in the ring. As a whole the film is fairly good and Smith did a fantastic job of depicting Ali, but the last scene really does stand out in my mind of one of the most complete closing acts to any film I have seen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They date back to 1983 when *they* first came to Wellington. At first we Wellingtonites accepted them and there was peace, gradually however our armistice broke down and there was conflict on the streets. We eventually won, but there had been so much conflict and bloodshed it was decided that all those who had fort against *them* in the great battle for Wellington should have there memory erased and that the city would be rebuilt to how it looked when *they* first arrived in 1983, and so it was that normality returned to our sleepy capitol. These markings on the ground were part of *their* escape plan, every time one of *them* was taken up the resulting radiation left these strange markings on the ground forevermore. Also, this gap in time is why Wellington seems so behind the times compared to other fast-paced, busy capital cities, and why the mullet is still alive and well only in our, again peaceful, corner of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much all the music (except the last one) is Hans Zimmer. The one you like is called 'Time' from the Inception soundtrack, and is in my humble opinion one of the greatest pieces of recorded sound in existence. Another great one for listening to while working out is the penultimate track near the end, which is 'Why Do We Fall?' from The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack, I recommend it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While this is factually accurate, it is untrue in it's own terms. All foetuses do *not* start out as female before some make a transition to male in utero. **This is a common misconception.** In actual fact all foetuses are naturally hermaphroditic in the womb, before developing male or female characteristics relatively late in pregnancy. Both sexes have characteristics of the other inherited from this early developmental stage; men have nipples, woman have a clitoris (this is an undeveloped penis, and can be stimulated to develop in adult females with the use of steroids) and so on. The proposition that all foetuses start as female is, though widely believed, absurd when you stop to think about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before taking drugs, attempt exercise. Seriously. Chemotherapy is often referred to as a sticky-plaster effect, in other words it covers up the problem rather than makes you deal with it. Please, before you start them, join a gym or buy some running shoes, invest in some gym instruction if you can, the internet is full of workout recommendations. After a month or two you will be happier, healthier and genuinely feel better about yourself. About this time last year I was suicidally depressed but refused to take the drugs for personal reasons. Instead I started working out. Now I am about 14kg lighter, feel far more attractive than I ever have before and am able to feel good about myself again at last. I know starting something like this is tough, but if you are in a place where you are considering anti-depressants, any new move is going to be tough. I implore you to try it though, instead of doping yourself out release your aggression and your frustration on a heavy bag or a treadmill or a weight bar. I guarantee that if you persevere, endure and push yourself you will feel a great deal better about yourself. Be strong and stay strong, friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, here is a summation of the Healthcare issue, for what it's worth:

The Republican party are fighting tooth and nail against free-to-all healthcare, hence why the two parties have reached an impasse that is causing the shutdown. There is a great deal of smoke and mirrors surrounding this issue, but what this boils down to, in plain english, is a lot of very powerful people will lose a lot of money if healthcare becomes more reasonably available. The consumer (you) do not stand to lose anything, small businesses will not lose out on anything, however large pharmaceutical companies will lose a colossal amount of revenue.

A note on tax: Universal healthcare may not necessarily mean a tax increase for the average citizen. Setting up a National Healthcare Service may well be expensive to begin with, however it is worth remembering that 57c out of every one of your tax dollars currently goes towards the military. Think about that. Maybe you could build one less battleship and give the American people free healthcare. Besides, even if there is a tax increase, you will still be paying a degree of magnitude less overall per medical complaint, and "free healthcare to all" sounds so much nicer that "I will heal you for money". Every other *civilized* country has some for of universal healthcare, or at the very least doesn't take advantage of human frailty or abandon the elderly. America, you are being left behind.

**EDIT:** Gentleman and ladies, I know that, literally speaking, there is no free-to-all healthcare under ACA. There is also a slight spelling mistake in this comment, you are being pedantic! Big picture time people, stop splitting hairs </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking at the situation logically, I feel it would be a fair estimation to say that free-to-all healthcare would not damage small business but would significantly damage *big* businesses, i.e the hugely powerful drug companies who pay exorbitant amounts of money to politicians to keep the current status quo in place. Free healthcare means a lot of very powerful people will lose a lot of money. There may be plenty of smoke and long words thrown about, but as far as this observer can detect, that is what it boils down to, in plain english. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a short poem I wrote and posted on /r/shortscarystories:

 -

The shortcut through the Corn field

tempts you as you're walking home

the clouds above keep the moon concealed

as you enter the swaying corn, alone.

 -

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy.

It grows in rows without scope or end

and in the dark, you hurry.

 -

You don't see the standing forms

as you pass them on your way,

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay.

 -

Hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all,

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall.

 -

You tell yourself as you continue through

"it's merely the rustling of the leaves,"

but they see you, and they hear you,

and they might not let you leave.

 -

<TEXT> **A**. The Jews were not kept as the slaves to the people of Egypt. No contemporary Egyptian, Roman or any other evidence or account, other than the Torah, which has obvious inference issues. There was no Passover (the slaying of every Egyptian firstborn would surely be recorded as a major event by the Egyptians don't you think? Also, what a kind and loving act of God to kill the children of the oppressors, and not the oppressors themselves),  the Jews did not build the pyramids, they were not eventually set free. We know this because of historical evidence.

**B**. The question of the jewish claim to the holyland is obviously a hugely scrutinised issue today. It has been extensively studied by many archeologists (I can look up names for you but frankly a google search will do it if you are interested and I am tired) and even those with vested interest have admitted there is no evidence whatsoever that there was ever any wandering in the desert. There is however great evidence that Jewish settlements existed in the land we know call the Middle-East, long before the supposed flight of the slaves.

**C**. Your point concerning vested interest. Those who have vested interest in telling you this story are either those who wish to bring you into their church or those who wish to keep you there. Why do you think there are so many splinter churches? I must pass 10 different church sects on my way to work every morning. Religion is a malignancy, it is passed on and can be very hard to shake off, if you have ever tried you have my sympathy, I have been there. I ask you though, as a fellow human being, to question your beliefs, that is all. Please, look rationally at the principals of your faith, the obvious sectarianism it causes, the logical sense of it's teachings and the moral authority of your holy book. You are not a sheep. You are a living, breathing human being. Your life is precious *because* it will never come again. Please, make the most of that fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because Russia won't allow it. Thats why there is this whole mess going on now, because Russia is backing Assad, which makes him practically untouchable. That's why there has been all this fuss, otherwise the UN would have gone in as soon as Assad started killing his own people. 

The reason that there has still been no action in Syria doesn't have anything to do with democracy or the fact that most people don't want their country to intervene, it is because Russia has stated, quite openly, that a western intervention in Syria would be considered an act of war against Russia.

These are the facts, I have no idea why they are not wider known. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay boys and girls, gather round and I shall tell you a tale...

In Nepal I crashed a motorbike while driving to the top of a mountain to visit a monastery. It was a big bastard of a bike as well, I was *very* lucky not to break any bones, just a few nasty cuts on my legs which I then patched up myself in my room with iodine and a reusable bandage. That was I think my second day in Nepal, near a town called Pokhara that used to be on the hippy trail. After recovering there for a few days I travelled to the capital, Kathmandu, and within a day or two decided I wanted to trek to Mount Everest Base Camp. To get there I had to fly from Kathmandu on this tiny little airplane that only could hold about 6 people and land deep in the Himalayas at an place called Lukla, which is, I think, the third most dangerous airport in the world in terms of crashes. From there I trekked, alone and with a still bandaged leg, for 9 days through the Himalayas before being forced to turn back because I developed mild AMS (Altitude Sickness) before I could reach base camp. I think it took me 7 days to walk back to Lukla. This was, by the way, through the Himalayas, on my own, with a 22KG backpack wearing Converse trainers, and it was probably the best month of my life, apart from the AMS and busted leg!

Come back next week to hear about the dead bodies in India or the cobra attack in Vietnam! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I travelled round the entire world when I was 18, completely self-financed and unassisted. I worked pretty much none stop for 2 years before I left to afford it and had some pretty wild experiences, the highlights probably being getting AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness, or Altitude Sickness) while climbing in the Nepalese Himalayas, coming face to face with a tiger in Thailand and getting rammed by a bull in Varanasi, India. I never talk about it though, because I don't want to sound big-headed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Holocaust.

When I was 16 I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau and it left a huge impression on me. What was unbelievable was the sheer organisation, it wasn't some ritualistic bloodletting or angry slaughter, it was an industrialised effort to efficiently, quietly and assertively wipe out not just one demographic of people, but anyone who was deemed less than human. There are rooms full of shoes, suitcases, clothes, Zyklon B canisters and human hair in Auschwitz, all of them representing individual people with thoughts, lives, parents, hopes and dreams of their own that were all wiped clean from the earth. I remember seeing a plaited ponytail in the room of hair, probably from shaven from a little girls head, and I don't think I will ever forget that detail.

This was the Summa of human evil and depravity and have left their mark on me. I have never since then said the name of that place aloud or discussed it, even with my closest friends of family.  After that experience though I cannot laugh or abide jokes about the Holocaust. Only those who do not understand what it cost humanity can make light of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might be referring to the testimony of the watchmen Frederick Fleet when describing the unusual atmospheric conditions that caused them not to spot the iceberg until too late, as there was no moon, no swell and the berg was of dark blue ice (common for icebergs that have recently flipped over) rendering it practically invisible from a distance, however Fleet would say that as it somewhat detracts the blame from himself as lookout.

There are many theories around The Californian as to why it did not come to Titanic's aid, for example that there may have been a third, unknown ship between Titanic and Californian that also happened to be displaying flares, or that Californian did not realise the Titanic was sinking. Both circumstances are extremely unlikely as all crew on the bridge of the Californian admit to seeing Titanic's distress signals and the Second Officer of Californian, Herbert Stone, whilst being question during the inquiry into the sinking admitted that he said to an apprentice "*Look at her* [Titanic] *now...she looks very queer out of the water; her lights are queer.*" Californian's Log book from the night of the sinking mysteriously vanished and all crew acted very evasive during questioning, so no one really knows why Californian failed to act.

Most of my source material here is from the book' Rough Guide to Titanic', so unfortunately I can't provide links, I'm sure all this is on the net somewhere though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personal Trainer here. Popular myths are that it is necessary to diet and work out. In some cases it is, but if you are just trying to be healthy eat normally and do lots of cardio work. 

Another myth, and a very common one, is that you lift a weight, and you gain muscles, easy! No. No, no, no! There are hundreds of different ways to use weights to build muscle, simply pumping a few weights without knowing what you're doing won't do it. You need to decide which muscles or muscle groups to work on and find out where your absolute strength/endurance limit is. Then add an extra 10lb. We call it 'systematic overload', you give you muscles slightly too much to cope with and it causes them to strengthen, think of it like supply and demand. Your body knows it needs more muscle to work, so it strengthens it. Simply throwing a few weights about won't do the trick. For arms or back the trick is to find a weight you struggle with and do about 3 sets of 12-15 reps. If you can finish the last set without crying, it's not heavy enough! It is very important to learn how to use weights properly though, make sure you get good instruction before doing anything big! Seriously!

The same is true of running. Again, get someone to teach you how to do it properly, or don't bother at all. You may think this is silly, but running incorrectly can put huge strain on you legs and ankles: I once broke my leg while training for a marathon! I developed a stress fracture and was dumb enough to ignore the pain and keep running on it, until it broke and I missed the marathon! So take gym safety seriously people!

**TL;DR** - read the damn post you lazy bastards, it's not that long!

**EDIT:** Okay a whole heap of rather pedantic people are taking issue with my 'don't worry about dieting' advice. The point here is that when a human body engages in large amounts of physical exercise, especially when the body in question is not used to strenuous exercise, it causes large amounts of muscle and tissue damage, which is good as that breaks down fat and causes muscles to grow. In order to repair and recover after a taxing workout, the body will be using several times more food matter, especially protein, than normal. If a person were to eat nothing but salad and then try to run a marathon, that person would collapse after half a mile. Depending on the exercise, it is vitally important to have a high calorie, high protein diet while engaging in extremely strenuous exercises. Now, as I'm sure not many people reading this are going to run any marathons in the near future, they don't need to up their calorie intake. Consciously reducing your calorie or protein intake however will give you less energy (ergo forcing you to abandon the workout sooner) and prevent proper muscle recovery, therefore it is advisable to continue eating normally, as the body will already be experiencing enough shock without an extra spanner in the works. Once a workout routine is established, you may wish to gradually migrate to a healthier diet.

 I have oversimplified somewhat here, but I hope I have made this understandable to all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, I'm amazed that no one actually knows this. The reason the UN (here incorrectly referred to as 'The West') has not intervened before in Syria is ***Russia***.

Russia is a close ally with Syria because Russia's oil supply is mostly distributed via pipelines that run through Syria. For that reason, Russia has made it extremely difficult for any kind of outside intervention to happen in Syria, as the message they are sending is simply '*you fuck with Assad, you fuck with us.*" It basically has meant that Al-Assad and the rest of the Syrian Government has basically had Carte-Blanche to do what it likes. The thing is they have now crossed so many lines that the world is starting to squirm, but still no action is being taken because no one wants to upset Russia. Any move to displace the Syrian Government, particularly by the US, would therefore be seen as a direct military move against Russia.

It is the same reason that North Korea is untouchable, except in that case it is China that prevents outside intervention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Entropy. For the first time in history the rate of human population has started to increase at exponential speed. Before this present period in history the general population remained steady as life expectancy was far shorter and infant mortality was far more common. The world population only topped 1 billion in approximately 1810. Now there are 7 billion, a 2 billion increase in the last 20 years. This planet is an isolated system, we only have so much energy and as the population increases the energy becomes spread out far too wide and is rendered ultimately useless and finite. No new energy can be created capable of sustaining an exponentially growing population: the human race is, quite simply, unsustainable. The only hope is the discovery of a new boundless energy source (which on principal contradicts the first and second laws of thermodynamics), or extraterrestrial colonisation. It's going to be a scary century.

**EDIT:** Energy in this sense does not only pertain to electricity. Fuel in general is what is meant, be it mechanical, biological or simply food. Solar Power alone will not be enough to sustain humanity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A friend of mine who I knew from Kindergarten age enlisted after leaving high school and was shot in the neck on Christmas Eve a few years back. He died after several hours. Remember, men do not give their lives for their country, their country takes their lives without thanks. Joining the armed forces may seem glamourous, thrilling or patriotic, but remember you are volunteering to allow men you have never met to risk your life for reason's that don't concern you.

Most importantly, please consider the effect your joining the armed forces have on your family. I daresay most in this thread will have know of someone or will themselves have lost beloved family member to the forces. Remember it is not only your own happiness you sacrifice by joining.

Please consider your decision very carefully, and don't buy into patriotism. Your country does **not** need you, and by volunteering you will not be safeguarding your country from darkness. I of course have only the absolute greatest respect for any serving men or women and veterans, but I cannot help remember my friend, the loss his family and friends suffered, and the terrible feeling of waste I felt upon hearing the news.

Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back, and to the left.

Incidentally, I have looked into this as I found it a genuinely interesting subject. There are holes in the story, and big ones, but the points that generally are raised by conspiracy theorists are mostly entirely falsifiable. It does seem, based on all the evidence, that JFK was shot from the 6th floor of the Book Depository. The kill shot, as seen on that Zapruder film, is consistent with an exit wound from the back right, Kennedy's head moves the way it does because of the exit wound which blasts out the front of his skull causing his head to move back, towards the shot. James Tague (possibly spelt wrong), sometimes referred to as the third wounded man, was nipped by a fragment that could only have come from the direction of the Book Depository. 'The Magic Bullet' is also easily explained. Whether the shooter in the Book Depository was Oswald is unclear, but very likely. If it were just for these facts, there would be no conspiracy theory, it is clear that Kennedy was shot, using Oswald's rifle, from the Depository. Where it gets interesting is Jack Ruby, Clay Bertrand, the reaction of the police when arresting and interrogating Oswald, dramatic change of Kennedy's policy under LBJ, and the fact that many of the secret documents and evidence, including Kennedy's brain, has disappeared. Literally: it is unaccounted for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tonight I had the Burg-As Bro  Little Beer Quarter

*Beef and lamb patty with pork belly, fried quail egg, aged cheddar, chilli-onion jam, pickled beetroot, Tuatara APAioli and lettuce in Pandoro bun, with chips and dip*

Easily the best burger I've had so far, the patty was beef and lamb, which I thought sounded like a weird combo before I tried it but tasted awesome, the pork belly was perfect, and the aioli set the whole thing off nicely. I thought a few crisps with a sour cream/mayonnaise dip instead of chips was a nice touch, and the bun wasn't too heavy so it didn't fill me up to fast. Honestly couldn't find a single thing to fault it, even the beer was nice!!

10/10 - would definitely eat again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I empathise with your plight friend. I of course won't say 'I know what you're going through', because I don't and that is a cliche. I know how it feels though to be silently in pain, and to feel like a burden. Small things make huge differences, allow someone, be it a friend, parent, sibling, anyone, to understand what is causing your behaviour, or why you are unhappy. It seems daunting I know, but this is the first step to getting better, and it's important.

Most important of all though, is you need to show people how strong you are. Endurance is the greatest trait a person can have, because without endurance and your ability to endure pain, strength is meaningless. Remember that you *will* break through this, no matter how hard it is now, not for anyone else, but for yourself. Because you are strong enough to endure it, and once you have proven that to yourself nothing can hurt you, and one day you will be so proud of yourself that you came through a very dark time with your head held high. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To all those arguing that the practice is in some way medically beneficial and not linked to religion or sexual repression, consider first that circumcision is not only forced upon men, but upon women also who suffer an even more ghastly and humiliating procedure. There is no justification for female circumcision, at all, other than cruel sexual repression of an infant by an adult, and should not be considered as anything but repugnant. 

Consider this before you defend such a barbaric tradition as this, please. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. The practice is a religiously inspired one, and the central tenant in all major religions is sexual repression, which of course is no coincidence. The purpose of circumcision is to weaken an desensitise the organ in question, thus discouraging its use, especially in girls. These are the facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sectarianism. I see plenty of people saying 'religious differences' in this thread, and that is a fair point, religion does tend to be a divider. However, it is not the only one. Sectarianism takes many forms, be it religious, race related or nationality, to name a few. Anything that allows people to use the label "Us" and "Them", rather than "we". This is a primitive and primal instinct, but it is the last obstacle to be toppled before mankind may know peace. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Entropy. For the first time in history the rate of human population has started to increase at exponential speed. Before this present period in history the general population remained steady as life expectancy was far shorter and infant mortality was far more common. The world population only topped 1 billion in approximately 1810. Now there are 7 billion, a 2 billion increase in the last 20 years. This planet is an isolated system, we only have so much energy and as the population increases the energy becomes spread out far too wide and is rendered ultimately useless and finite. No new energy can be created capable of sustaining an exponentially growing population: the human race is, quite simply, unsustainable. The only hope is the discovery of a new boundless energy source (which on principal contradicts the first and second laws of thermodynamics), or extraterrestrial colonisation. It's going to be a scary century.

**EDIT:** Energy in this sense does not only pertain to electricity. Fuel in general is what is meant, be it mechanical, biological or simply food. Solar Power alone will not be enough to sustain humanity. </TEXT>

The reason the violence is continuing is because a large islamic group who supported the now ousted president Morsi because of his radical Islamic beliefs have been violently continuing to protest, which has caused the military in turn to violently suppress them. There is politics and revolutionary sentiments obviously, but the reason for the continued violence is Islam, or rather An Islamic group protesting in favour of stricter Sharia Law and Islamification of Egypt.

<TEXT> It's not such a stupid question, don't worry. No that theory wouldn't work as human communication (in this instance sign language) just isn't natural to chimps or gorillas, their minds just don't work like that. If they want to communicate with one another or with their young, which they do, they do so through other means (i.e body language, eye contact etc). Though they are intelligent enough animals to be taught basic sign language, they can't actually ever use it to communicate efficiently, as a human would, because it simply doesn't make sense to them. It's like a human learning to climb a tree to get fruit from the top branches. Though a child might be able to notice the adult climbing the tree and understand why they are doing it, it won't actually improve the child's climbing ability.

**EDIT**: Okay, I'm getting lots of comments from fairly silly people who apparently don't understand analogies. Chimps cannot use sign language, no none-human animal has ever learned or used sign language in a remotely human function. Some very intelligent animals have been taught how to communicate very basic messages, such as "Look over there," "Give me food," "I want...," etc, but it is not in the nature of an animal to understand human communication, grammar, sentence structure and so on. Surely that is obvious. Monkeys communicate with each other through very different medium. A mother monkey may teach a young monkey how to sign something in order to get food, but this is no different from a human mother showing a child how to open a coconut or cook meat in order to get edible food. It is not language as we use the word, because monkeys do not use language, they simply do not have the necessary brain function to understand or use human-style language.

My climbing trees metaphor may be a poor example, but surely you can get the metaphor? The point I am making is a child cannot learn how to do something unatural to them, like talking to dolphins or building a honeycomb, simply by observing, it is something that has to be taught, because by it's nature it is not normal human behaviour. If you took issue with the statement because children can climb trees, you're an idiot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Spanish Tomatoes recipe takes 5 minutes and is honestly one of the nicest meals I have ever had. Here goes:

1. Heat up a handsome dollop of Olive Oil in a frying pan, add a few herbs to taste.

2. Add chopped onion, thin sliced garlic, olives, a jalapeno or two, maybe some meat to the hot oil.

3. Allow the onions etc. to fry for a little while, then add most of a tin of tomatoes to the pan, making sure to stir thoroughly

4. add more seasoning, especially a good pinch of salt (sea salt is best), oregano or basil is good, maybe some more garlic or dried garlic flakes. If you have it add a good splash of balsamic vinegar and a cheeky few drops of red wine, stirring thoroughly.

5. Keep stirring and leave on a high heat for a few minutes, until the tomato juice boils off somewhat.

6. Serve! I like to do myself some fried bread with this, which is easy enough, just add a little more oil to the pan after you have plated the tomatoes and put a few slices of bread in the hot oil for a few minutes.

Enjoy! Extra bonus points can be achieved by adding some chorizo sausage and red wine with the onions, and adding feta or parmesan cheese with the balsamic vinegar. Once served sprinkle a little feta cheese and salt over it and you're ready to boogie! 

**EDIT**: For those who are going to have a go, comment back with how it goes, especially if you try something original! Lots of people are asking for pictures, unfortunately I don't Instagram my food because I don't have the mind of an 6 year old girl, but if someone who cooks it could upload a picture it would help everyone out! Glad you guys like my recipe! Now go cook it for your friends and make out you've been cooking it for years and you just made it up one night! </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are prayer flags. The mountain is sacred in Nepalese and Tibetan tradition, they are at the summit to honour the mountain, not someones junk.

This comment thread kind of makes me sick, all I see is a bunch of kids saying how easy this is because many people do it. You guys have the wrong idea, this is a hugely significant achievement, the reason you see pictures of lots of people summiting at once is because there are only a few days in the entire year with good enough conditions to summit. 

Climbing Everest is still an immense physical achievement. Yes a few people have done it by now, but the huge majority fail every year. One in eight people die climbing Everest. It is a very big deal to stand at the top of the world, and one of the most physically gruelling things a human can do. It's isn't as though there is a stair lift the whole way, it takes several days and real strength to climb. Yes there are more challenging mountains in terms of mountaineering ability, but that isn't the point.

OP, your girlfriend is epic and deserves the highest of fives, bravo! I trekked to Base Camp a few years back, I felt privileged just to be there, let alone attempt a climb. Make sure you hang on to this one, she's a keeper!

<TEXT> As it happens I have been round the world 3 times so far, the first time when I was 18 when I travelled alone, self-financed and unaided for 9 months. I was attacked by a cobra in Laos, had a close call with a tiger in Burma, and was nearly mugged in Kathmandu, although was able to defend myself. I have seen more death than many my age and have plenty of experience of the darker side of humanity. And I have never felt the need to carry a gun. Please don't lecture me on how the world works, I don't come to your place of work and knock the sailors cocks out of your mouth do I? Grow up a bit, and realise the world isn't out to get you. If you are not a complete idiot, you will never be in enough trouble to need a gun. If you are that much of a moron, carrying a gun will only put you in more danger than it will prevent. Grow up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To defend yourself from what exactly? Just admit you carry a gun to feel more in control, or more masculine. Comments like the above just make you look like a paranoid dumbass, so the choice you have is to represent that facade to the world, or admit you are an insecure yet decent person with penis issues. If you are in law enforcement, or are being hunted by cannibals, you would have a point. But this is the real world, you are not the star of a movie, so please do yourself a favour and cut the action-hero bullshit, and maybe just stuff a few socks down there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have a great deal more respect for pro-gun individuals, such as yourself, if you could simply stand up and say 'I carry a gun because it makes me feel safer and more in control/confident', rather than spew these ridiculous, hole-ridden arguments. A first aid kit is in now way the logical or moral equal of a gun. It is a moral certainty that no situation will occur in your day to day life that will require you to be carrying a gun, or that you will be somehow be able to 'save the day' or be in a better position than anyone else because you are armed, you will almost certainly only put yourself at greater risk. This isn't the movies. 

The only exception to this rule is if you work or live somewhere where there are dangerous animals (e.g bears) or for self defence if someone breaks into your home, in which case it is permissible to own a small gun which can be stored in a safe place in the house. There is no reason to carry a gun in your day to day life, assuming you aren't a member of law enforcement, and it would be nice if you would be honest enough with yourself(ves) to admit that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you read the original script by Alex Garland the ending is actually pretty awesome. I love the film personally, but I do think Danny Boyle made a few errors in judgement in how he shot the end sequence, but that is just my taste. In Garland's script each characters storyline comes full circle in the end, theres no silly punch-up between Pinbacker and Capa, and Pinbacker has a much more awesome (dare I say, fitting?) death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometime, in moments of extreme stress, a persons mind will simply disconnect from its surroundings in a primal psychological attempt to escape. If, for example, a person were being tortured over a long period of time, their mind would invariably enter a make-believe state. These hallucinations can be extremely vivid, as though the person is living an ordinary life, or can be more like a fantasy, like driving a fast car. Time and reality can be constant or inconstant in these dream states, for example you may at one moment believe you are in one fantasy when your brain will suddenly jump to another, fabricating memories or circumstances to fit the hallucination. But the real world always eventually will force itself back in on the hallucination in order to bring the victim back to reality, be it noises, physical pain or, more commonly, the face or faces of whomever is present in the real world with the person suffering the hallucination. Other times, when these stimuli don't work, the mind of the sufferer will continue to point out the flaws in the fantasy, like waking up from a dream, to force the victim out of the dream-state and to wake up, as prolonging the hallucination may result in insanity, the sufferer must be brought back to the real world, you must WAKE UP </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here is a link to an AMA I did about travelling a while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14dbv0/i_travelled_around_the_entire_world_solo_when_i/), hopefully you can find a few tips in there, any more specific question then feel free to message me, I'm happy to advise as I only got as far as I did thanks to the advice of others! I self-funded myself by working a few jobs for quite a while before I left, rather than work on the way round, which you can do!

Don't be worried by your nerves, anyone would be nervous about taking such a big step. There will be times when it seems utterly overwhelming, but you have to keep reminding yourself what you are doing, be proud of yourself and enjoy the ride! Keep reminding yourself that what you are doing is remarkable and something you will look back on with pride, and will make you a much stronger person in the end. Most of all you need to learn endurance and self-reliance, they are the two most essential things a traveller can possess, after a valid passport! 

Good luck with your travels, do you know where you are going yet? If you have any more questions feel free to message, hope it goes well for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if this counts, but I have been present, as a civilian, at a number of mass-demonstrations and social uprisings, in Thailand and Nepal, probably being the most dangerous. The Bangkok riots (pretty sure they were on the news a few years back) were intense and turned violent quickly, no one could leave or enter Bangkok for several days as the airport was closed and the roads were jammed, and an unofficial curfew was in place. There was a huge military presence, lots and lots of guns and I even saw a line of tanks on Ratchadamnoen Klang, one of Bangkok's main streets. It was an interesting experience and the first time I heard gunshots fired in anger, but I kept my head down and after a few days was able to leave. An interesting few days they were though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I travelled around the entire world alone when I was 18. I was completely self-funded and I managed to make my way across Asia to the Indian sub-continent and got AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness or Altitude Sickness) while climbing to Mount Everest Base Camp, among many, many other bizarre and awesome experiences. I am fucking proud of it as I see it as a major achievement, but it's impossible to talk about it without sounding pretentious or arrogant, so it never really gets mentioned. It already feels like it has become a private story or memory, which it shouldn't be, because it doesn't get talked about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The shortcut through the Corn field 

tempts you as you're walking home

the clouds above keep the moon concealed

As you enter the swaying corn, alone.

*-*

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy

it grows in rows without scope or end 

and in the dark, you hurry

*-*

You don't see the standing forms

As you pass them on your way

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay

*-*

hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall

*-*

You tell yourself as you continue through

"*Its merely the rustling of the leaves,*"

But they see you, and they hear you,

And they might not let you leave. </TEXT>

You can't see anything around you because the corn is too thick and too tall, but for all you know there could be hundreds of stationary, standing figures all around you, and you wont be able to see them.

<TEXT> If exercise is easy, you aren't doing it hard enough. Before you all downvote me to oblivion, this only holds true if you want to build visible muscle or lose lots of weight. 

While the body is ticking over, for example if you are jogging at a relaxed pace, your heart rate is slightly above average and your muscles are using slightly more oxygen. This is okay if you are simply trying to stay in shape, but not if you are wanting to drop weight etc. If, however, you carry on working until your muscles grow tired, your heart and muscles will be working so much harder in order to keep them going. So if you are running for a while and quit when you get tired, thats okay as you are getting fit and healthy, but not okay if you want to lose weight. It is people who can keep going through the pain barrier and force their body to work when it feels like it cant anymore that really will lose weight and tone up. The same is true for muscle building and weight training, if you are doing 3 sets of 12 reps, for example, the muscles for the first 8-10 reps will function normally until you really start to strain, when the muscle is working so much harder because it is tired. Again, it is people who can push themselves to do the extra 2 or 3 reps when their arms are tired who will build muscle most efficiently.

TL:DR - If you want to just stay healthy then exercise should be fun and easy. If you want to lose weight and build muscle exercise should hurt like a motherbitch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is quite a slippery-slope argument.

What upsets people about the recent NSA scandal is that there seems to be a great deal of evidence appearing the ordinary, law-abiding, tax-paying people are have their phone calls, emails etc bugged or recorded. The NSA, thanks to The Patriot Act and other legal documents, are within their rights to do this, despite it being a gross breach of privacy for ordinary citizens. What has upset so many people (and quite rightly) is it is ordinary people who are being so jealously spied on by the NSA.

The crux of the argument is most people would agree that this level of spying is good when it is potentially dangerous individuals who represent a danger to innocent people being spied upon, but problem seems to be that  the NSA does not limit itself to that, and seems to have spent a great deal of time and effort spying on the American public en masse, as well as (according to recent news developments) various international offices and embassies.

This obvious does raise larger arguments such as the problem of deciding who represents a significant enough danger to society to warrant the level of privacy invasion the NSA seems to have wielded with such indiscrimination, and it could be easy to get drawn into a debate regarding racial, religious or social profiling.

So in answer to the question at hand: no, even if the NSA had successfully intercepted and stopped multiple terrorist attacks, this does not justify indiscriminate and Orwellian-like constant surveillance by the, or any, government on the population at large, as a whole. Personally I find the distinct and traceable rise of totalitarianism in American politics a lot more disturbing that potential terrorism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Partially agreed. I felt the film was *in general* very well made and Henry Cavill did a great job, there was just far too much time spent where the film seemed to be saying "look how awesome all this CGI is!", the fight scenes went on forever and were thoroughly disengaging after a while, as well as the fight scene at the end. It just went on without development, i was actually bored by the end. The plot was a little weak and Zod's character could have been much better developed with a little more time, instead we just got a ton of special effects and endless destruction.

TL:DR: **Great CGI Great Film** </TEXT>

**Quick Edit:** The story of *The Californian* is surprisingly unknown, considering it's implications. For those who don't know, *The Californian* has been remembered by history as '*The Mystery Ship*' that was seen from the deck of *Titanic* as she sank. Captain Smith reportedly intended for the lifeboats to go back and forth from *Californian* in order to overcome the problem of the too-few lifeboats.

The crew of *Californian* had warned *Titanic* of three large icebergs in her path, saw her distress signals and heard her distress call, but mysteriously failed to act. To this day, no one fully knows why, as the crew acted very evasively upon returning to port and the on board record from the night of the sinking were destroyed by the crew.

<TEXT> The moutain in your picture is not Mount Everest, it is an entirely seperate mountain called Ama Dablam. It is in the same range as Everest, but hugely smaller. [Here is a photo I took last time I was there of Everest, Lohtse and Dablam.](http://imgur.com/B4HWHCN.jpg) Note: Dablam was a great deal closer to me in relation to Everest and Lohtse when I took the picture, they are a lot further away than they look. Only the pyramid summit of Everest is visible, and from some angles Everest is roughly pyramid shaped, especially from the east, assuming this picture is a sunrise.

**EDIT:** u/skatelinsy has edited his comment using my picture. This doesn't illustrate his point very well, as only the summit pyramid of Everest is visible on the far left. Lohtse is the peak to the right of Everest and Ama Dablam is on the far right of the picture </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right, this does seem to be a little pedantic. The point here though is that some conspiracy theorists (not necessarily myself, as I say I am undecided) make the argument that Oswald didn't take the easier Houston Street shot because if he waited for the car to turn onto Elm (where Kennedy was shot) it placed the Presidential Motorcade in a 'triangulated fire' position, ergo Kennedy would be trapped between the Book Depository and the Grassy Knoll. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was an interesting read, thanks for your input! The story is still full of holes though. From everything I've heard Oswald insisted outright that he was "*just a patsy*" etc, completely denying being involved in the assassination. So my point is this, yes the fuzz may have had a very small and circumstantial case against him for the murder of Officer Tippit, but what evidence did they have that he had anything to do with the assassination of Kennedy? I highly doubt he confessed and they only tied him to the Carcano Rifle *after* he himself was shot by Ruby. The only evidence seems to be that he worked at the book depository. Yet it seems within minutes of his arrest he is booked with the assassination.

As for the shooting itself, I have also heard the theory that the first shot hit a traffic light and ricocheted (hitting James Tague, who was standing by the overpass) and it seems convincing. Frankly, the easiest part of the story to believe is that the shooter was on the sixth floor of the book depository, although there are still loose ends here. The fatal shot does seem to come from behind Kennedy, although over fifty witnesses did report to hear shots from the picket fence, and (although I believe the 'Magic Bullet' theory to have been disproved ad nauseum) I have heard a slightly convincing theory concerning the Zapruder Film, which shows Kennedy clutching his hands to his neck while Connolly turns in his seat. The theory I have heard is that the shot that took Kennedy in the neck came from the front, while Connolly was hit seconds later by a separate bullet from the Book Depository. The evidence for this theory being that Connolly himself identified the moment he believed he was shot on the Zapruder film as several seconds after Kennedy has already raised his hands, as well as the Texas autopsy identifying the bullet wound in Kennedy's back as an exit wound.

As I say I don't find all of this convincing, these are just theories, but I do maintain there is a lot of strange and conflicting evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back, and to the left.

EDIT: There are several aspects of the assassination that still don't add up for me, the direction of the fatal headshot being the least of them (as many of you point out, the movement of Kennedy's head is consistent with an exit wound). Some point's worth considering:

* Oswald's Arrest - There is considerable confusion around Oswald's alleged murder of Officer Tippit and his subsequent arrest. Oswald was arrested in a cinema only a few hours after the assassination with over a hundred officers present. Oliver Stone comments on this as "the greatest display of police intuition since the Reichstag Fire".

* Kennedy's brain has disappeared. Seriously.

* Why not shoot Kennedy as he drives up Houston Street, its a far easier shot.

* There are several secret files apparently being withheld from the public concerning the assassination. If there was no conspiracy, what are these secret files about. I need citation for this, can anyone help me out?


I am not laying blame at anyones door as that would require more evidence than is available. But I am of the opinion, because of many of these discrepant facts, that some more than what meets the eye was happening that day. </TEXT>

Also, I hate to be the one to point this out, but if this were an authentic battlefield there would be a lot more debris than just a few cannonballs. Not saying this isn't genuine, just it might be fair to assume this was either a very selective and pre-organised photograph, or it was taken some considerable time after the event. </TEXT>

The US Government is one of the most corrupt in existence, congressmen and lawmakers are payed small fortunes by companies and corporations to pass laws that suit industry rather than the individual, and the entire government is figureheaded by one man with infallible power.

<TEXT> The principal behind this is called exponential growth; every generation you go back your number of direct ancestors doubles, so you have 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 16 great-great-grandparents etc. By the time you go back just 10 generations you already have over 1000 direct descendants! Extrapolate this over such a large time period as 1000 years and the number of  direct descendants you have will be so huge that it will be far more than there have ever been human beings.

There is a story in China that uses the same principal. A peasant puts a single grain of rice on a square of a chessboard and asks the emperor to give him two grains of rice on the next square and to keep doubling it across the board. The emperor agrees and by the time the peasant has made it to the last square he owns all the rice China has ever or will ever produce.

The family tree scenario works because after only a few generations your family tree will become so convoluted that it is inevitable that it will cross over many many times, so the same person will appear multiple times on your list. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to take a guess that you sought advice on circumcision from someone involved in the clergy? I'm sorry to disagree with you but it has been proven by the medical profession that circumcision does not hold any benefit, think about it logically. If it were beneficial for men not to have foreskin, we simply wouldn't be born with it. Evolutionary economy is ruthless, everything evolved on a human body either serves or has served a purpose, surely that is obvious. Also the idea of preventing infection is utterly ridiculous, how many foreskin infections have you heard of? Teach you son to be hygienic, don't mutilate his body. As for sexual pleasure, use your common sense please. It desensitises the penis, that is pretty much the whole point.

As to Mosaic law: Surely the obvious contradiction is why would one God set down the laws for man to follow in one book of The Bible only for the other God to disagree with the laws and use his own for the second book of The Bible. This is meant to be the infallible word of God remember, if you are a Christian. 

The idea that forcing such an irreversible act upon a unknowing child makes me nauseous. Why wouldn't you respect your son enough to wait until he is old enough to make such a unalterable choice for himself, in full view of the facts? Why is it normal to do this to children?

I say it again, circumcision has no physical benefit. If it did, we would not be born with foreskin in the first place. Use your brain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I happen to know a great deal about Christianity. The only old testament law Jesus definitively refuted was was that man could work on the sabbath, which remember was one of Gods ten infallible commandments, which of course negates the whole list of ten. The concept of having the Old Testament of laws followed by a the New Testament which negates those laws is utterly absurd, surely anyone can see that? If you are a Christian The Bible is meant to be the infallible word of God, why would one God disagree so much with the other (and himself) and what laws men should follow?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nowhere did I mention Africa, nor anything related to race or any specific culture. Yet you assign these labels yourself. I shall not go so far as to accuse you of racism in return, but you seem to be more guilty of that you might realise.

Again you use the euphemism of *tradition*. Again, I point out that this is misleading, as a more accurate description might be *religious* tradition. I will of course admit that not all traditions are the same, but the uniting factor is that the *purpose* of genital mutilation of young girls is to stunt and repress sexual pleasure. This is barbarism. Do not protect such cruelty by claiming it as tradition. Do not patronise the thousands of miserable souls tortured by it. Do not be so cold and uncaring as to imply that such a vile thing should be sustained for the sake of *tradition*. To do so is moral equivalent of sacrificing these wretched girls on a stone alter.

Sources: Much of my specific information on this comes from various essays and books by Christopher Hitchens, as well as my own research in various journals (I volunteer with Unicef). For example, the use of the sharp stone, or the twine to be broken by male force upon marriage is part of the 'tradition', not me adding colour to the argument. I will not be so simple as to link the first article a google search will give me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many people here are saying tradition which is somewhat misleading. The honest reason is *religious* tradition, rather than cultural. It is a commandment that all jewish boys must be circumcised on a specific day soon after birth. The man performing the circumsision is called a '*Mohel*' in Jewish tradition and to complete the process he cuts around the forskin, places his mouth on the severed penis and sucks off the foreskin before spitting it out with a mouthful of blood and spit. 

Remember that the Old Testament of the Bible is the Jewish Torah, so in theory any Christian has to follow every law that orthodox Jews do. Many modern American Christian continue the practice for this reason.

Circumcision has been roundly proven to not improve hygiene in the male and lessens sexual pleasure (as is presumably the whole point). It does not serve any medical purpose.

Apologies if this seems profanatory, I have been as to the point as I can </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel slightly sick that this got so many upvotes. Female genital mutilation is a very real thing and affects millions of women world wide. It is a disgusting and inhuman practice in which the clitorus is cut off, often with a sharp stone and the vaginal opening is sawn up with twine, not to be broken until the dreaded marital night by male force. The reason and justification for this practice sits squarely at the feet of organised religion, I am not an fire and brimstone r/athiest but blame where blame is due.

It is barbaric and inhumane and, as it still ruins the lives of so many people and thus is a standing insult to our species womanhood, not subject for satire.

Why do you think they get away with all the human rights violations, blatant fascism and the invasion of Tibet? Furthermore, why do you think NK gets away with starving its people and developing illegal weapons? 

It is because NK are backed by China who are too powerful in military and economic terms for anyone to do anything about it. If China side with NK and this goes to war, you can bet that will mean WWIII unless piece with china can be assured by the US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The trouble is, because of the opaque nature of arabic, it is very difficult to translate arabic into other languages (hence the massively varied interpretations). I agree that reading it would certainly alter peoples perspectives, although much like the Old Testament (or Torah, call it what you will) the level of wanton violence might make people think twice about organised religion, if that is your goal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was once very sick in India for about 4/5 days, I had no one to help me as I was pretty much locked in a crummy hotel room and the temperature was getting as high as mid-50s celsius (Northern India in April). After a couple of days I was extremely sleep and food deprived and suppose my fever must have been off the charts as I started to hallucinate that my body was some kind of separate hostile entity that was fighting me, or waiting until I was off my guard or resting to make me be sick of worse again. 

I recovered after a few days, then spent the next month hiking solo in the Himalayas. I estimate I lost somewhere between 20-30 lb. in the space of a month. Totally worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. My main sauce is Christopher Hitchen's book '*The Missionary Position*', I suggest you start there. There are plenty more; several documentaries have interviewed Nuns previously in Mother Teresa's employ who worked at the hospices. Plenty of people visited the hospices, especially in Calcutta and gave plenty of evidence to the squalid conditions. There is a huge amount of sauce material on this.

Before Bernie Madoff broke the record, the largest fraud in history was done by a man named Charles Keating. Keating donated much of his ill gotten money to Mother Teresa's organisation. After he was caught it was requested that Teresa give the money back, though she had no legal obligation to do so, so it could be returned to those who had been defrauded by Keating. Not one penny was returned. This is historical fact. Just because you have not looked up the sauces, does not mean they do not exist or aren't credible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed, and Mother Teresa absolutely shouldn't be.

EDIT: allow me to clarify. Mother Teresa is one of those people who gained a reputation by having a reputation. She did not, as some of you fine people appear to think, save millions of lives, or even improve the condition of those lives. She ran hospices for the dying. According to credible sauces those in her care were not allowed medicine or visits from family or friends and were expected to suffer and die. In fact, Teresa herself many times spoke of how important 'suffering' was to her ministry. Meanwhile she is flying around the world shaking hands and accepting cheques from all sorts of highly reputable people, such as Charles Keating or the dictators of Haiti. She was given the Nobel Peace Prize for aparently no reason at all (as was Obama and Kissinger, but thats another story), and in her acceptance speech claimed that "abortion is the biggest risk to peace". She had very little influence on the world yet gained a huge reputation, and is remember for her reputation rather than her deeds, which are questionable at best and deceitful despicable at worst.

<TEXT> I find it slightly bizarre and disturbing that as president, you would have to approach religious authorities to issue a fatwa against execution of gays, rather than use your own authority. I understand that this may be necessary due to the power held by the mullahs or the ayatollah. Perhaps it may be more appropriate to attempt to limit the power held by these figures sir, or would that be political suicide? The opinion of many people in the western world is if peace is to be had and Iran to progress as a 21st century nation, the power held by religious agencies must be limited and separated from political matters. I would love to know your opinion on this.

Stuff like that? Far too many people hold Jesus up as a moral exemplar, the truth of the matter is that the Jesus of the Bible was racist, immoral and tied to wish-thinking and belief in magic. True he is an improvement over the genocidal maniac of the Old Testament, but that is much like saying Stalin wasn't quite as bad as Hitler. No, Jesus was not a great teacher, we do not need his example.  </TEXT>

Here is [another example of Soviet picture editing](http://imgur.com/IfCz5O5.jpg), in this case it is Nikolai Yezhov, former head of the NKVD (Stalin's secret police) who was edited out of many photos after his execution.

Also, notice several other men have been edited out (the man with two to the left of Lenin as well as the man with the dark beard in the foreground). It is unclear who they are or why they were removed however, in my opinion they are probably Trotsky sympathisers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Mommy Mommy, I saw a monster!" Timmy shrieked as he rushed out of the bathroom and into his mothers arms.

Smiling very slightly the mother held her son as he hugged her in fright, stroking his hair soothingly. "I've told you Timmy there's no such thing as monsters! You have such an imagination! Where did you see it?"

"In the bathroom," Timmy said in a small voice, still clutching his mother as all small children will do when they are frightened.

Mother knew her son had an overactive imagination and would not be able to sleep until she had proven there was no monster to him. She glanced up at the bathroom door, which had been left ajar.

A thrill of horror shot up her spine as she saw the mirror. Suddenly she felt the bile rising in her throat as though she was about to be sick. Her son was still reflected in the glass as though he was still standing before the mirror, yet her son had never looked like this, never looked so evil.

The thing in the mirror that so resembling her son gazed malevolently back out at her, an evil smile rising on its face. Its lips started to move.

"Let's play," said Timmy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of me salutes you for this response as you are, like so many other people have done, bending over backwards to make something that is so painfully obviously immoral into something good. Your explanation of original sin is good, mankind by its very nature is selfish, it is one of the three most obvious products of our long evolution (These being: self-preservation, the impulse for food and the impulse for sex). This helps to make nonsense of the commandment '*Love Thy Neighbour as you would yourself*'. The thing simply cannot be done, the most altruistic, loving person you know would not be able to accomplish such a feat. HOWEVER, though I respect your argument, *this is not an explanation of Original Sin*. Not even close. This is you attempt to justify an obviously immoral practise, for which I do not blame you. Original Sin is the hereditary blame passed down through the male line for Eve's bite from the fruit of knowledge. It is punishment that every human being inherits from the moment of conception for the crime committed by a distant ancestor. *This is not moral*. Just to compound the offence, let us look again at the 10 commandments. The punishment God lays down for making a graven image is: "*I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation*". The punishment of children for the crimes of their parents or grandparents is universally considered immoral today, let alone the condemnation of the entire human race for a non-crime committed, that hurt no one, by a fictional character in the antiquated past. This is, there is no other word, evil. I respect your attempt to square this by granting a different explanation, but by its very nature you can not cherry pick religion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please do not cast this response aside as argumentative, I would like to provide a reasoned counter argument to your comment but I do not wish to offend anyone.

What I find deeply troubling and disturbing about what you have said is that /u/kblaxchick "*is a sinner and deserves to be tossed into a lake of fire*". Yet you don't know this person and neither do I, the odds are that no one on this thread knows this person well enough to make any sort of judgement close to that in magnitude; it is a serious thing to say. Yet, because of what we already know about Christianity, this statement is normal and fair and you got 5 up-votes. We should see there is something wrong here. Christianity teaches, as you have already acknowledged, that *all* people, every man woman and child, is a sinner and should burn in torment forever and ever. Take a moment to consider, *why*? It is something more sinister than emotional blackmail, due to the condemnation of our basic human urges every Christian child has it burned into their mind that they are wicked and are going to go to hell if they don't believe in Jesus. You may say it is not like that, but you have already shown that this thought-process is 'normal' and to a child's mind visions of hellfire and the devil are more than just stories. The conscription of children for the purpose of this kind of blackmail is evil, there is no other word. If you had not had this done to you as a child, you might not have been so quick to call /u/blaxchick a sinner deserving of hell. If we are all sinners then God should have taken care to create a different species. It is the classic dogma of a person being created sick, and commanded on pain of eternal torment to be well. Christopher Hitchens compared it to living in a theological North Korea, "*but at least you can fucking die and leave North Korea.*" </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I may interject, I don't think an adversarial debate is really getting anyone anywhere, so lets put our pitchforks down shall we? 

As to /u/josh_thompson's point about historical evidence of The Bible. I'm afraid he does have a strong argument, there is excellent archeological as well as historic evidence that there was no exile from Egypt, there was no wandering in the desert. There have been many archeological attempts to research these topics, all of which overwhelmingly agree that these stories are erroneous. There are other checkable dates or events in The Bible that have since proven to be inaccurate after careful research, for example the census at the time of Jesus' birth and Noah's flood, for examples. If these stories are true they are checkable and verifiable through a number of methods, and the unavoidable fact is there is plenty of evidence to show that they are not true; they are myths, stories and parables. Now look at other Bible stories such as Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac, or the slaughtering of the citizens of Sodom, Gomorra or Jericho, the detailed commandments on the keeping of slaves. In that light, aren't you just a little glad that The Bible is not infallible? 

As for /u/this_to_shall_pass's points about science. You are quite correct, there are many complicated things that science as yet can not fully explain, although not the items you list. The danger comes when we start to see the holes in science and automatically fill them with God. For a great deal of history God was credited with the creation of humanity. We now know, thanks to Darwin, that we have a entirely satisfactory explanation for the existence of complex life, thus God is demoted to sunsets and mountains etc (all of which are perfectly explainable). This is called '*God of the gaps*', and most theists (believers) try to avoid due to its fickle nature. Just because science cannot yet explain something, that gives no indication that God is any more credible, and when science discovers an explanation for a phenomena such as gravity, geology or life on Earth, God is instantly discredited.

As to my own point of view. I look at the world (and my own human body) and I see extraordinary wonder in the complexity and beauty of what we all have. The chance that every human is given at life is precious beyond words because of its uniqueness and finiteness. You will never have a second chance at living this life and there is so much wonder to be seen and had that makes life precious, the most precious commodity there is. The idea that this life is a mere waiting room, a passage to the hereafter (incidentally, if life after death is infinite, what exactly is the reason for this life, or Earth at all?) then that utterly demeans life and destroys its value. Your life is so precious because it will never come again. You only have one chance to make the very most you can of it. Don't waste it.

Please don't think I am being aggressive or argumentative in this response, I felt it might be useful to open a reasonable discussion on this, rather than an aggressive discussion, and I welcome any response that is reasonable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Just like all things in The Bible there is no way of quantifying these facts and this is merely someones opinion, not a historically accurate and verifiable fact. Personally, due to the actual quote being *'The valley of the shadow of Death'* I would say it is very obviously metaphor for living in adversity.

Also this is a reverse causation. There exists now a valley called that. That does not however mean that that is what the line refers to. It may be more accurate to assume that the valley is named for the psalm, not vice versa. </TEXT>

I am going to call this as untrue as it is simply too fanciful, unlikely given Hitlers continued mobility and reported sound health until his death in 1945, and due to insufficient evidence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As you are exploring the bowls of the ship your flashlight picks something up at the end of the corridor. You do a double take and shine your light on it and you see a young girl dressed in Victorian clothing, just standing at the end of the corridor. You call out but no response. Suddenly, into the silence, the bulkhead door slams deafeningly shut behind you! You spin around to see what happens. From a short distance away you hear a child's laugh, echoing eerily in the damp ship. You point your flashlight back down the corridor. 

The girl is gone. </TEXT>

I mean think about it, Britain was *the* super-power for a lot of recent history with an empire that covered a quarter of the globe. There is a lot of history there! Losing India was far more historically significant than the American War.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> More accurately, the Quran (and pretty much all other holy books) is extremely ambiguous and open to many different interperitations. Some choose to be dogmatic, some chose to enterperate their text litterally, and even then there are litteral variations due to arabic being a highly ambiguious written language.

People of all faiths vary in how dogmatic they choose to be. Islam is no different and certainly no more creditable. This particular example recalls to me the old debates of the length of angels wings or how many such mythical creatures could dance on the head of a pin. It is pure drivel, it is an example of how totalitarian religion tries to fill every aspect of an individuals life. Is it so difficult to think on these issues objectively, without the crutch of religion? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hesitate to even respond as that is some of the stupidest words I have even seen written down. I assume you are being sarcastic.
Healthcare is unconstitutional

Seriously? Free healthcare for all is unconstitutional? You realise how stupid that is? Obama has had to be fighting idiots like you every step of the way with getting his healthcare system sorted, I don't think its political. Maybe its because anyone with half a brain cell realises that something is quite disgustingly broken when a family can't afford to heal, when a fatal illness like cancer might just cost you your house as well as your loved one. 

cost

Lets just lump that altogether shall we. You are more concerned about how much your government pays on healthcare than how much your family pays? How much would it cost if, heaven forbid, your sister got cancer, or your father was in a car crash. It could bankrupt you, for services that actually cost those providing them pennies. They charge so much simply because they can, because you privatised your medical healthcare. Even in England, where we have a choice between public or private, private healthcare costs a bare fraction of what you pay (our private healthcare system is called BUPA) You are extorted simply because years ago your entire healthcare was privatised and the drug companies have had carte blanche ever since. You are literally being made an offer you can't refuse, if you have seen The Godfather.

You're last point is so stupid I'm not going to address it, basically you are saying "government bad, grrr!" whatever. </TEXT>

1. All told the trip cost about 7000 GBP, I worked from the moment I was 16 until I was 18 to save up enough. 

2. Finding a cheap flight is just a matter of looking, try flight comparison websites or apps like Skyscanner etc. The cheapest places to travel are out of the western world. South East Asia and South America are good, India and Africa are very cheap but absolutely not for everyone, you may not like it.

3. The best places I went were Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Nepal and Mount Everest Base Camp.
 
4. See question 1. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bits of that are true, but not all. Edward VIII did abdicate so he could marry Wallace Simpson, however he couldn't marry her as king more because of the scandal it would cause rather than actually breaking any rules. That and he was a Nazi sympathiser. Remember the Church of England was basically created so that Henry VIII could divorce his wife, the entire Church is founded on the family values of Henry VIII.

Either way, the reason for his abdication don't really matter, the fact is that the abdication forced George VI to take the throne making Elizabeth the Heir Apparent at the age of 10. 

The fact that barely anyone in Britain knows any of this shows just how much no one gives a toss. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel you are being a little over fair here. Judging by that article (that article being my only sauce of information on this) this organisation did a great deal for these people, such as already paying down $700,000 and building infrastructure on the island to help them gain more income for themselves, with the plan to keep paying these payments in chuncks, if that article is accurate. These are not cave-people and I don't think they would thank you for the comparison. They live in the modern world where capitol is important and communication with the rest of the world is prevalent. 

And yet if you lived your life off deer and someone told you to stop hunting...

Deer are not the equivalent of dolphins. Deer are relatively very unintelligent and are a natural prey animal to most carnivorous species, including humans. Despite this they are plentiful and breed well. Dolphins have demographic language, social groups, use tools and hunt in packs, they are exceptionally intelligent and their brain to body ratio estimates them to be very close to human intelligence. They suffer acutely if attacked and are not nearly as abundant as deer. I am not saying one animal is more valuable than the other, however one is natural pray and is probably too unintelligent to suffer acutely, the other is rare and highly intelligent and suffers acutely.

As I say, we are not dealing with a time warp, these are not cave people who must hunt to save their families. They are members of the modern world who can produce their own food without hunting dolphins, as this organisation has been helping them doing. The slaughter of all these creatures, for the sake of a financial dispute is disgusting and despicable and should not be defended. There is no excuse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Granted, these people had obviously been taken for a ride by this charity whom must shoulder at least some of the blame. This is a disgusting and infantile reaction though, and should be met with retribution. I hate to use the word '*savage*' but is exactly what these people have proven to be. If this organisation pays them now, after this, then is an utter failure in logic and stupid. This is nothing more than a toddler smashing a beautiful and precious gift in a tantrum, and should not be met with anything but condemnation. They have forfeited their right to any price or property they were promised, and justly so. If they are punished by lack of funds or whatever was agreed upon for this barbaric act, so be it. </TEXT>

When you are there you need to keep your heart rate high, it depends on your level of general fitness how you do this but it is important to really push yourself to get results. Get yourself a pair of decent trainers for running/walking and make sure you eat correctly, which doesn't mean only eating nasty green things! The important thing is to positively encourage this, so if you go to the gym reward yourself with something you like, although preferably not food.

<TEXT> I commend your instance on accuracy, so I will attempt to clarify some of these points. The US did bomb a great deal of land in Cambodia which caused obvious disruption to farming, however the real problem was and is land mines. Cambodia and Laos still have an enormous problem with land mines because the US covered huge areas of rural land with them which are still active and still represent an enormous threat to this day. About 1000 people are killed or severely maimed by land mines every year in Cambodia and Laos, I am not exaggerating, a visit to either of these otherwise beautiful countries is enough to impact just how big the problem is. And the US is doing absolutely nothing to help clean up the mess they caused, or prevent the deaths all these people. Only last year did the US start a clean up operation of all the Agent Orange used, if you don't know what it is google it. Kissinger was lucky to escape without a war crimes trial.

As for the execution of prisoners, the Khmer Rouge converted a school in Phnom Penh into the S21 jail. This is were the documented every prisoner held there and on what grounds they were arrested, almost all were 'political prisoners'. There are records and photographs of over a million people. S21 was were many died but most were horrifically tortured, however the 'Killing Fields' as it became know was an area outside Phnom Penh where most were executed. There are enormous mass graves, a room filled with the skulls of victims and a tree is signposted as where small children were thrown against in order to kill them. It is hard to overstate the extent of the evil performed by the Khmer Rouge, but it is certain that they knowingly and deliberately put millions of innocent people to death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is the sort of drivel that only the indoctrinated would resort to in a debate, so this shall probably be my last entry. You just confirmed it, the church pushes us mere mortals to be beyond 'human nature'. What a despicable thing to say, surely you can see the faulty logic for yourself? I will repeat my argument, if you believe in the Catholic God you believe in a deity that created us sick, and *commanded* us to be well. Condoms will not cure the virus, nor will they heal those afflicted, but they will prevent millions of otherwise healthy, normal people from contracting the condition and the virus today would a fraction of the epidemic that it is. These are not statistics we are arguing about, these are human lives. Millions of fully aware, fully sentient human beings have died a humiliating, painful death because of the stigma placed on condoms by religious bodies. How can this be the lesser of two evils? 

Please, consider the problem for yourself and do your own thinking before regurgitation the garbage you have been dictated in church. You can make your own mind up on these matters, to think for yourself makes us human, to blindly agree makes us cattle. Make your choices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who has been to Cambodia and the S21 Jail and the mass graves of the killing fields just outside Phnom Penh, I find this extremely moving. It was a horrible experience to visit such evil places, many of the instruments of torture have been left in the jail and most are simply too awful to describe or recall. What is strange and deeply disturbing is the Khmer Rouge documented and photographed every prisoner who lived and died in the S21 Jail, and there is now a room in which all wall space is taken up by pictures of the poor souls who perished. All with this expression of knowing what lay in store for them, all gazing out from every angle. Though the pictures are old and faded, witnessing that much human suffering is truly disturbing and brings a lump to my throat even now, recalling it </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not refuting that the Catholic church does help those in need, they do spend a great deal on charity as anyone can see. However, it is very easy to argue that the greatest damage to public health in Africa and the responsibility for the miserable and wretched deaths of *millions* of human beings lies squarely at the feet of the Catholic Church's stand on condoms and birth control. It is not a matter of religious vs secularist opinion at all; any rational, objective and moral person in full view of the facts would be appalled by the contraband placed on condoms. Sure, if people did not engage in pre-marital sex the virus would not be such a terrible affliction in the world, but that is not human nature: if any divine creator wished this to be the case he/it/they should have taken time to create a different creature. It is the classic case of mankind being created sick and commanded to be well.

<TEXT> I think the Church's stand on Condoms and AIDs in Africa is enough to illustrate the moral bankruptcy and total hypocrisy of this spending. There are many aid organisations that spend great deals of money, often given voluntarily by those who can, on helping those in need. The Church is the only aid organisation that demands anything from those they help, and what they demand is truly adherent, as is any policy that excepts the death of millions to a terrible affliction such as AIDs as the lesser evil. No, The Vatican is no source for good in this world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is highly dubious as to wether Hitler really did have one testicle, it has never been conclusively proven and frankly it does sound like propoganda to me. However, Herman Goering was shot in the testicles during the Beer Hall, or Munich Putsch in 1923 and as a result became addicted to morphine for the rest of his life.

Also Chairman Mao, China's 'Communist' leader (lets call a spade a spade, China is a Fascist state regardless of what they call themselves) suffered from an undescended testicle.

There seems to be a pattern doesn't there, fascist dictators tend to have one ball. Makes you wonder what Mussolini's package consisted of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I (along with the rest of the non-american western world) find it truly and deeply disturbing that this is such a prevalent view taken by Americans, and that apparently some people in the states can't tell the difference between a high-powered military-grade assault rifle and a baseball bat. There is ***NO*** justification for such a weapon to be available to the public, no rational reason whatsoever. If you want a gun for personal protection, get a pistol or two and place it in a lock box somewhere strategic in your home. If you want a high powered rifle, join the military or just grow up and be satisfied with the penis you were born with. </TEXT>

If you zoom in far enough you can actually see climbers, albeit climbing the glacier not the actual mountain.

For those interesting this is taken from Kalar Pathar and the new Everest Base Camp is along the bottom of the picture, under the Glacier. Everest is the peak on the left, half hidden behind a closer peak and Lohtse is the peak to the right of Everest, which is the 4th highest mountain in the world!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apparently it was very old glass (some of it 15cm thick) and it ruptured due to age and very cold weather. The tank contained 33 tons of water along with several animals such as sharks, turtles and rays (plus 3 lemon sharks which can grow to 10 feet in length). All the animals died and 16 people were injured, although none seriously.

'Melanie Laurent -En T'Attendant'

It's hard to define what genre this is, its the Damien Rice end of large ensemble folk music (Rice guests on the album on a few tracks). A lot of the album is french language so I have no idea what the songs are about a lot of the time, but the music is wonderful! [Here is a link to the title track.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwb8hXlUE1E)


Fun fact: Melanie Laurent is the actress who played Shoshanna in Inglorious Basterds. She is also a great musician apparently! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The infancy of humanity. The inability to explain natural phenomena and disease. The very apparent and totalitarian presence of death, for 99% of humanities existence it was uncommon to live past 30. Consider just how much the world has changed in the past 200 years, and bare in mind humans have existed for anywhere between 100-250 million years. We are at this time in history *just* learning to open our eyes, only now after so much time are these issues, that dominated the life of every human being for millions of years, are being addressed. How is it possible to unquestionably see that this *is* the nature of religion? Simple, just look at the prolific nature of religion. There are or have been as many completely different and varied religious groups are there are grains of sand on a beach, all of them designed to offer the same explanations for the various blights of humanity.  Humans for many years *needed* religion to explain the hostile nature of the world. Now we need Doctors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what is know as a 'backronym', all expressions (such as '*save our souls*' etc.) being invented to fit the pre-existing acronym.

The same can be said of the original distress call 'CQD', which is a combination of the original distress call of 'CQ' ('*scu*' from the French word *scurit*), then the D was added latter to stand for '*Distress*'. A common myth is that CQD stands for '*Come Quick: Danger*'.

SOS replaced CQD as the official morse distress signal in the early part of the 20^th Century and played a role in the sinking of Titanic, as there is a story that as Titanic sank the radio operators were signalling SOS rather than CQD, and no one understood that SOS was a distress call. This is probably a myth, but still interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that was the first attempted assassin, Nedeljko abrinovi, not Princip. After abrinovi's failed attempt Ferdinand (after stopping at Sarajavo Town Hall) took a different route to the cities hospital (where he was initially going) but the driver took a wrong turn and braked so as to reverse the car. By coincidence, this was only a few feet away from Princip (who was one of 10 assassins involved in the plot to kill Ferdinand), who took his chance and fired twice into the car, killing both Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophia (although she was not intended as a target). He was instantly arrested, which is when this photo was taken. He died in Jail three years later due to complications after his arm was amputated due to tuberculosis, probably caused by a poorly fixed broken bone in his arm from when he was arrested in Sarajevo.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Communism is a tough one to say whether it works or not, hence why there is still so much discourse on the subject even today. The trouble seems to be that all modern countries that identify themselves as communist are simply Fascist states, for example North Korea and China, though they declare themselves communist in principal (I am generalising of course and including Marxist-Lenninist politics) they can not be identified as anything but fascist. Most people seem to agree that the problem with communism is it grants too much power to too few people, as in North Korea, China and Stalinist Russia. Not to say Communism, or something close to it, can't work. Cuba is doing just fine! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, sorry for the late reply!

Yeah I just travelled with one backpack, the trick is to travel as light as possible, which gives you a lot more freedom to move around! I also took a guitar, but that's just because I cant go without! You don't need to travel with a laptop, its very easy almost everywhere to get online and to access computers, and a laptop is just one more thing to get broken or stolen. As far as what equipment, I'm not really sure what you mean? I didn't use any specialist equipment really, it's important to take a good and well supplied medical kit and my trusty iPod, but thats about it!

Cheap is a relative term, cheap compared to what I (being english) am used to may be reasonably priced in some places. I did get in a few scrapes but nothing *TOO* hairy, the trick is to be very smart and self-aware. You learn this quick enough, especially travelling alone. The trick is to not look like you are a person of any interest, there is a real art to being able to blend into a crowd and not catch anyones eye. If you look uncomfortable, scared or overconfident or in any way affluent you will be a target for trouble! If you look like you are in control and not-to-be-fucked-with, you will have no troubles! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I travelled solo around the world. I fell of a motorbike in Nepal, got a concussion from falling of a skateboard in New Zealand, trekked the Himalayas alone and got AMS (very deadly if not addressed) and had to turn back but almost broke my ankle, which would have been guaranteed death. I swam with sharks (without meaning to) and once nearly got bitten by a cobra in Vietnam. Oh, and there was also the time my bus was nearly attacked by men with AK-47s in Laos.

This is all true by the way and I have photos of most of this to prove it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This might seem like a strange one, but countries would certainly not exist if the everyone thought like me. After all, what is a country but another reason to form prejudice, wether positive or negative, over a perfect stranger. Try to image in it: No war, no dispute in the middle east, no conflicting militaries, no unrepresentative governments, no taxes, no restrictions upon travellers, no ruling class, no dictatorships, no reason to hate a person you have never met (other than religious grounds, but lets leave /r/atheism where it is). This is not to say that local cultures, languages, traditions and customs should be abandonded or assimilated, they should not. This is more akin to allowing people to be governers of their own destiny, and to not be collateral in political affairs. This, in my most humble opinion, is where Marx went wrong.

<TEXT> Fair enough, I wasn't sure where that money came from, although it is certain that is was money given for earthquake relief, that was spent on illegal whaling. Specifically it was mostly spent I believe to repair the Nisshin Maru, the main whaling factory ship.

<TEXT> I have never done the Appalachian Train and don't know much about it so can't really give you a great deal of advice I'm afraid. I will say though that in my humble opinion real explorer spirit dwells in having the balls to leave your own comfort zone. From an outsiders perspective (I am not American, I was raised in England and have just emigrated to New Zealand) it seems that most Americans don't seem to have any interest in international travel, which is a huge shame if you don't mind me saying! If you are serious about wanting to experience some real adventure, blaze your own trail instead of sticking to the same old path that all the squares have strolled along before you, be your own explorer! You can do this on any budget, if you have a bit of spare cash though I recommend you take a trip to perhaps either South America or the Indian sub-continent, there is a lot of adventure to be had there, and you can feel free to ask me for any advice! Happy planning! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't plan much before I left on purpose, to give me more freedom when I was there, just where my flights would go and how long on each continent. 

Most essential items, hmm, good question! 

Most essential would be the passport, obviously! I kept it on me at all times, 24/7.

Second most would be my iPod, there's a lot of boredom and sitting on buses involved in travel, I would have gone crazy several times over without my trusty ipod! 

Third, my medical kit. It took up the most room by far in my backpack and I used everything in there!

Fourth, my camera! When you are seeing that much awesome every day you need a decent camera, I actually only bought one after I had already been travelling for a few months, but still got some awesome pictures!

Fifth. hmm, I didn't have that much stuff! I would say my diary. Keeping a diary is a surprisingly rewarding thing to do while travelling, and my travel book is now my most treasured possession! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent about 6-7000 GBP all told, which isn't bad going for such a long trip! I planned and booked my flights in advance, but thats it. I booked a place to stay in USA and when I arrived in a new western city like Auckland or Brisbane, but other than that I just showed up in a new town or city and sorted out food or accommodation when I was there! Its often the best and cheapest way of doing it, although not for everyone as there is always the chance you might not get somewhere.

Ways to save money: The big ones are eating and sleeping cheap, the other best way to save your pennies is use local transport, as appose to tourist transport. You will find that in many places like Asia or India there are plenty of cosy, pricey travel options like flights and nice buses that are for tourists. However there is always local transport for local people, its usually pretty basic and more often than not cramped and uncomfortable, but its cheap and you meet interesting people! The only other way of saving money is to not spend it on silly things like souvenirs and day trips and so on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! You don't need to worry too much about travelling if you are a young woman though, I answered another couple of questions along those lines. Basically it is safe in most parts of the world to travel solo as a woman, in some places though you should be a little more mindful of how you dress, i.e minimum bare skin and nothing tight fitting or revealing, and just be a bit more mindful about where you go (stick to crowded or busy places) and where you go at night. These are just basic safety precautions anyway, you just need to pay a little extra attention if you are a woman. Lots of young women do travel solo though, so don't rule it out! 

Happy travels! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the tip about the subreddits! I have answered lots of questions about what you want to do, read a few of my comments and that should answer most of your questions! I am happy to offer advice though! South East Asia is a good call, check out Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam. They can all be done on a budget but be warned, there is quite a bit of poverty, especially in Cambodia and the touts are sometimes quite aggressive, so it is not for the faint hearted.

Your parents are justified and right to be worried, it is a big deal! I am extremely grateful to my parents for supporting me and trusting me to have the brains and the balls to pull it off. World travel is not for everyone, you need to be an independent, self-aware person but you learn that while travelling. It is normal to feel overwhelmed at the start of a journey or trip, so watch out for that! Your parents are right to worry and you should be glad they do, they just need to be able to trust to you be smart and brave. </TEXT>

If you don't mind me saying, it is an unfortunate fact that a disproportionally low percentage of Americans bother with international travel, which is a shame.

<TEXT> Flights are the only expensive thing, but theres plenty of apps and websites and travel agents who can do you a good deal. Try the app Skyscanner if you have a smart phone. I personally wouldn't recommend the UK, but I am biased as I grew up there and just emigrated to New Zealand! Europe is awesome, lots and lots to see, but expensive. If you can afford it, try Italy, Germany, France and Norway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did it alone because it gave me much greater freedom and I didn't know anyone who wanted to go as far or travel as wide as I did!! Travelling alone gives you much more freedom, for example if you are bored of one town you can take a bus to wherever the hell you want, you don't have to get anyones agreement or permission. Besides, you meet so many people on the road I was never lonely for a second, and if you meet sufficiently cool people you can team up and travel with them for a while!

Make sure you pick a good travelling companion, time on the road can stress out even a close friendship! You need someone who understands and listens to your needs and above all will care about you if you are upset or ill. Expect arguments, don't let them ruin your travels!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. The trip all told cost me around 6-7000 GBP

2. The trip lasted just over 9 months.

3. It depends where you want to go! I would hugely recommend New Zealand to anyone, it is as beautiful as it looks in LOTR films! I also loved Viet Nam and Laos. If you are a little more adventurous I would hugely recommend Nepal!

4. I have shared loads of tips in this thread, read a few comments. If you have any questions I haven't answered feel free to PM me!!

5. Meeting people really isn't difficult, I made some great friends with people from all over the world. Meeting fellow travellers is very easy as most tend to eat and sleep in the same places and all are keen to chat about shared experiences or share advice on where to go and not go. I also did my upmost to talk and help locals as much as I could, which is a lot more fun! I once spend an afternoon in Northern Viet Nam drinking Whiskey with a group of elderly men who couldn't speak a word of english, it was such a great laugh!!

6. I stayed in all sorts of places! stuck to hostels in western countries for the sake of my budget, in Asia guest houses are cheap and plentiful! I also stayed with locals in some places like Nepal, which was very cool! Staying safe is a matter of having the brains and the balls to avoid trouble and stand up for yourself if its unavoidable. I never got myself in too deep, I can look mean when I need to, which would have been hard to believe if you had known me before I left! You learn fast how to look after yourself when travelling alone, and it can be a very strange or seriously cool feeling knowing you are completely responsible for your own well being and no one on the same continent as you knows who you are or what your name is.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions I am happy to answer them!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took as little as possible with me, in fact the thing that took up most room in my backpack was my medical kit! That is the most important thing, you will need bandages, malaria pills, rehydration sachets, more bandages, a good disinfectant like Iodine and some extra bandages. Other than that clothes(you don't need many, I took 2 pairs of shorts and 5 shirts), a good camera, a diary (writing a diary on the road is hugely rewarding, mine is now my most treasured possession) and a good book, which it is common practice to trade with other travellers once you have read it. 

I started planning simply by deciding that I definitely wanted to see the world and which bits of the world I wanted to see! I settled on a route that took me to New Zealand, South-East Asia and India. That was it for planning though, I deliberately didn't plan too much to give myself extra freedom to do what I like when I was there, best way to do it!

Travelling as a women isn't a problem, you can still go to most places without having to worry. There are a couple of extra considerations, like making sure you dress sensibly: Keep bare skin and tight fitting clothes to a minimum so as not to attract unwanted attention, and just pay extra attention to where you go after dark. This is being over-cautious to a degree, as almost everywhere is safe (or not abnormally unsafe) for women travellers, but maybe bare this in mind on the Indian sub-continent or Middle East. Also in many countries women are expected to dress modestly out of religious deference, but it always greatly got on my nerves when people looked down there noses at me for religious reasons.

If you want any more advice feel free to PM me! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I feel it changed me and my perspectives hugely. I was a much stronger, more independent man when I came back from travelling, all my old friends commented at one time or another how I had changed, apparently I had a stronger walk when I came home, which I was quite flattered by! I did gain a much better perspective on the world and what people can do to one another under certain circumstances. For me I reflected a lot on the nature of Capitalism and Religion, I won't rant about either but you certainly get a lot of perspective on both once you see enough of the world.

Plus I lost a ridiculous amount of weight, I barely existed by the time I got home! </TEXT>

<TEXT> roughing it just means eating basic food (you can eat very well in Asia on a minimal budget! The trick is to eat where the locals eat!) and basic accommodation. The cheapest room I stayed in was in Namche in Nepal, cost 50 ruppees, thats about 20 english pennies or 35 american cents. A little competition I sometimes played with fellow travellers was who had got the cheapest room. I always won! (I did tip extra when I left!)

I started in England and travelled to: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England </TEXT>

There were many times when I felt at risk, I injured myself in many crazy ways (falling off motorbikes   skateboards) I also swam with sharks and poisonous jellyfish (without meaning to, and came within 2 feet of a 12 foot Nurse Shark, no cages, nothing) I saw dead bodies in India with needles still in their arms and was followed by a drug dealer in Kathmandu, but the only place I genuinely feared for my life was when I got lost in Los Angeles at night. </TEXT>

I made a habit of talking to locals as much as I could wherever I was and made some good friends from all over the world! I would usually stay in a place 2 or 3 nights until I got restless then ask other travellers or locals where they recommend I go next, its a cool way to live! To counter culture-shock or homesickness I would usually try to eat western food about twice a week and kept in touch by email with people at home. I got hooked on chicken sandwiches in South-East Asia, I have no idea how they cook them but I have yet to have a meal that tastes better than a chicken sandwich in Cambodia!!

Yes I am from England originally, but I live in New Zealand now. Are you American or Canadian? My advice before going to London would be to abandon any romantic ideas about the place, its hardly a land of fairytales! I never liked going to London, although there are a few places worth seeing, like the museums and Tower of London etc. My advice would be to see a bit of England outside London, I grew up in the countryside in a county called Norfolk, I recommend it! Stephen Fry is also from Norfolk! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went travelling after leaving college (I'm english, college means something else in America) then went to University afterwards. I've just finished uni.

Yes travelling does pretty much force you to grow up fast, especially if you are travelling alone. It is a strange feeling knowing you are entirely responsible for your own well being and that no one on the same continent as you knows your name or who you are. I became extremely independent and had a great deal more self respect when I got home. People said I had a different, stronger walk when I came home, which I found quite flattering! I suppose world travel does look good to a perspective employer, shows that you are a very organised, self-reliant person. I've never really thought about it from that perspective!

My parents were actually really supportive, which I am hugely grateful for! I know many parents wouldn't dream of letting their child loose on the streets of Asia alone, but my parents trusted me to have the common sense and balls to pull it off. I cannot put into words how grateful I am to them for that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, I would actually advice against moving somewhere without seeing more of the world, its actually not a good idea as you probably have romantic ideas about what its like then when you get there you will probably be disappointed. So many people go to India then leave after 2 or 3 days because of this, I know someone who booked a 6 month trip to India, then went home after 48 hours!! Culture shock is a real thing and it can be huge, especally if you haven't ventured outside the western world!

I recommend you and the Mrs take a holiday in Thailand, Google Koh Samui or Koh Chang, it would be an awesome trip for you and wouldn't be too huge a culture shock! </TEXT>

I would definitely encourage you to at least think about taking a trip, you don't have to go round the world, just venture outside your comfort zone, you will find it so rewarding!

Language barriers weren't really an issue, my trick was to learn the basic phrases like "hello" "thank you" "yes" "no" etc when i went to a new country, but most people at least understand basic english or sign language. One of my fond memories from the road was drinking in a remote roadside 'bar' (for want of a better word) in Viet Nam drinking whiskey with a group of old Vietnamese men.

<TEXT> I would definitely encourage you to at least seriously consider travelling! You're only young once and the world is worth seeing!!

Things to consider: obviously cost is a big factor. How much you have depends where you can go and for how long, places like India and parts of South East Asia are cheap enough once your there, but flights and travel insurance (you have to have travel insurance!!) are pricey, not to say you can't get good deals though!

If you can get yourself to Bangkok though, you're sorted! Travelling south-east Asia isn't difficult as plenty of westerners do it so its very easy to meet other travellers and see lots of awesome things, most people understand english and travel options are plentiful and cheap! India is also a cheap and rewarding place to travel, although it most certainly is not for the faint hearted. You can expect a big culture shock when arriving in India and if you fly into Delhi or Mumbai expect to hate it passionately at least for the first day or two. Once you get out of the cities though there is a huge amount to see and lots to experience!

If you happen to be female you need to take a few extra considerations, mainly just obvious things like be careful how you dress and where you go at night. Generally though keep bare skin and tight clothing to a minimum and stick to crowded places are good advice, and being female is not a good reason not to travel, plenty of women travel solo without a problem, just avoid certain arabic countries such as UAE or Qatar, who regrettably still have a very medieval attitude to women.




Obviously there are loads more things to consider with something this big, if you have any questions feel free to PM me though and I will do my best to answer! I only got as far as I did because of the kindness of others, so I feel its important to pay it forward! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Touts. buying souvenirs is usually okay from street venders, but never book hotel rooms or any kind of travel arrangements from anyone who is not either employed by the hotel/travel bureau or travel agency. Also you should never buy anything or give money to child beggars. This sounds awful I know, but the gruesome fact is in a lot of places children are deliberately denied and education and forced into poverty as child beggars earn more money. In some places children are even deliberately disfigured or blinded, it can be genuinely upsetting and disturbing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its usually pretty clear when someone wants bribing, but important not to offer a bribe to the wrong person, that can land you in serious trouble! Certain places it is simply expected, on the border between Laos and Viet Nam it is the norm, there are even hand-writen signs up saying how much standard bribes are. Bribes are only necessary for tourists though. In some places it is the opposite, for example on the border between Nepal and India being white gets you a lot of preferential treatment, the border guards refused to search my guitar bag, because I was white. I was on a local bus and one of only 3 other white people, it was a seriously uncomfortable experience! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats a valid question, yes I am a man. It's an interesting point, in a lot of places your gender doesn't make a difference, but unfortunately in some places it does. For example, in India I travelled for a short time with a girl I met while travelling, and when we went into a shop or to a market together, the shop owners would only address me, even if she asked a question, the norm being that as a man, even though we barely new each other and were the same age, I was still responsible for her, because she was a girl. It was very strange. In most of the world (the exceptions being those governed by religious bodies such as many arabic countries) it is safe to travel as a woman, although obvious more care must be taken on matters of clothing and personal safety. If you happen to be a woman and planning some travel of the beaten path, always wear sensible clothing and nothing skin tight, and be sure to pay attention to where you go and when, i.e sticking to crowded places and be careful where you go after dark. It is an unfortunate state of affairs that this is still the case in some places, but it is important to be mindful of these things nonetheless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Europe is cool, but very expensive!! Cheap accommodation is very hard to come by in most of Europe, especially the parts that are considered 'touristy'. I try not to use any networking sites while travelling, I find it is best just to talk to other travellers about where to go, what to do etc. It depends how much you want to spend and how comfortable you want to be, for Europe I recommend the website laterooms.com, usually good for finding cheap hotels etc. Places of the beaten track... try Norway, especially the north (make sure you go in summer!) and Bruges. Depends what you want to see!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All the predictable stuff. You have to provide a police check (and have a clean record) and proof of any qualifications you have. If you are deemed valuable (for example have good qualifications or useful skills) it is easy enough to get a residency visa. You have to remain a resident for a few years, during which you have to work, then you get full citizenship. I am still just a permanent resident of New Zealand, I think I have to do some kind of test in a year or two before I am aloud to be a citizen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My long term goals fit quite easily around my travelling, as I try not to have any long term goals other than be happy! After I finished travelling I went to University in England whilst at the same time starting my emigration process to New Zealand. Now my emigration is underway and education is finished and I have a spare bit of cash on the hip, I decided to hit the road again!

Okay, a list of countries I visited in order, I started in England by the way: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England.

Epiphanies, excellent question! a lot of people ask similar questions about travelling, usually something along the lines of "did you find yourself". This is a misunderstand of what travel is about (usually spouted by people who spend a summer in Australia or Florida and then say they '*found themselves*'). It is true that during travelling you can, or have to develop a totally new persona, especially if travelling alone. It is also true that if you stray far enough from the beaten path and explore not only the beautiful, but also the grotesque and the despicable, you do start to ask certain questions about the human psyche, good and evil and, in my case, the nature of religion. So in a broad interpretation, with enough time on the road you can discover more about the workings of the mind and the parameters of your own sanity. However, the one thing the people who talk of discovering themselves fail to take into account is what happens if you dont like the man you find? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can be, I managed to do it relatively stress free. The emigration process takes a long time (obviously it varies country to country) but the biggest issue I faced was shipping all my stuff across the world and saying goodbye to important people I left behind. Its easy enough to stay in touch though and shipping stuff can be easy enough, depending how much money you can spend on it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nah its not more expensive, it all depends on how you do it! If you are willing to sacrifice **ALL** your creature comforts it can be done quite cheap, depends where you go!

The most remote place I reached was tiny isolated mountain villages in the Himalayas, one called Khumjung and another called Tengbouche, which has a famous monastery. It was a wonderful place to be, the scenery was just beyond imagination, it was breathtaking (literally as there was only 30% normal O2 levels at times!)

Visas are easy to sort out, the only countries I visited that demand visas in advance were India ($60 US in advance) and Viet Nam ($40 USD in advance) Usually just showing up on the border and bribing the border police works (I once had to bribe the same border guard twice on the border between Viet Nam and Laos!) I have a british passport which is still well respected, its not hard to sort visas out. The only thing is if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport a lot of Arab countries will not allow you a visa, so watch out for that! 

Language barriers are easy, you simply learn a few useful phrases like hello, thank you, yes, no etc but english is a universal tongue, most people will understand what you are saying if you are patient.

My emigration process to New Zealand has been fairly smooth, although they have just changed the rules, I'm not sure what it's like now. I have a University Degree which makes things easier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots and lots of flying, the most fun was flying in a tiny twin-engine from Kathmandu, Nepal into Lukla, which is officially one of the most dangerous airports in the world as it is carved into the side of a mountain with a too-short runway, which the decided to fix by making it extremely steep so the planes just drop off the end! It felt a lot like the scene from Aliens when their spaceship is dropped onto the planet! Anyway...

I used lots of local transport, especially in Viet Nam and India, the worst journey being 40 hours from Kathmandu to Delhi on a local bus, an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy! Other than that there was a couple of motorbikes (I fell of one going down a mountain in Nepal, still have the scars!) and a skateboard (fell of that one going down a volcano in New Zealand, still have several scars from that!!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Varanasi, India. Insane place! It is the holiest city in hinduism as it is right on the Ganges and is said to be the ultimate place to die if you are a Hindu, so there is a hell of a lot of dead people about! Right on the river bank there are what are called 'Burning Ghats', which is were the bodies of the dead are cremated in the open air, as many as 200 a day per temple. However, bodies of children, cows or people with infectious decease, such as leprosy or malaria are not aloud to be burned, so are simply weighed down and dumped in the Ganges. Yet, it is also considered spiritually cleansing to bathe in the Ganges in Varanasi, so while you can have 20-30 bodies all burning away right on the river and the constant dumping of human and animal remains into the river, you have hundreds of people all along the river bathing. Insane. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sympathise with your point of view and you are of course right in much of what you say. There are christian-run soup kitchens and clinics and all variety of aid available, especially in the western world. However there are also all of these same things organised and put into motion by secular people and charities. Personally I find this form of rewardless altruism far more moving than a religious charity giving stance, but I digress. The unfortunate truth is the Catholic Church is a lot more picky about whom it grants aid to than any secular charity. Oxfam provide famine relief, support and aid to all manner of people in all manner of situations completely regardless of who or what they are, even entering war zones to do so. The same, regrettably, can not be said of the Church.

<TEXT> I think you will find most atheists (yes, there are a lot of mindless plonkers on this site who just like to poke fun) can see there is some good done in the name of religion. However, we also see the amount of evil done in the name of religion. Being open-minded is about balanced and objectivity. Yes the church obviously gives a great deal of aid to the world, but they do a lot of harm, and have caused untold suffering. weigh up both sides, as many other people do, and come to your own conclusion. merely saying both sides look like idiots only shows your ignorance.

<TEXT> Lets break this down. First thing to notice is the word 'non-governmental'. Lets face it, there are very few non-governemental aid organisations, and since we grant the Catholic Church their own sovereign state (Vatican City), how can they be considered non-governmental? They simply can't, and I would be interested to see their percentage of wealth and capitol spend on aid compared to that of other countries or charities. I dare say it would not stack up quiet so well.

Second. All other charities in the world, save those dreaded few sponsored by religion, help those in need and in famine, they make no demands upon the suffering, they simply give aid. It is commonplace (I am not just ranting, I have seen this for myself) for christian charity to only be given to christian people, that is to say if you do not believe in Jesus and the christian doctrine (or the wickedness of condoms) you simply are not aloud aid. No other charity includes indoctrination as part of its charity, and this should not be considered anything but wicked. Also, lets just quickly look at where the catholic cash-bags come from. Before modern globalisation the Catholic Church was by far the most insidious imperialist nation in the world, and the cash flowed in from all corners of the impoverished world. Look at the damage done by Christianity in Africa. Other charity organisations take money from those who can afford to give and apply it to the poor. The Catholics look at the money they already took from the poor and think they aught to give some back.

Third, let us examine the inference of this claim. This is wikipedia, it does not make this statement true. I highly doubt it is compared to organisations such as Oxfam, who I have worked alongside.

EDIT: Instead of just downvoting me, why not offer a response? I will reasonably address any sensible response to this comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a topic I have given a great deal of thought to (as have many people, obviously) and have come to my own conclussions which I will atempt to elaborate fairly, so please no one mistake my for a fire and brimstone /r/athiesm-ist.

The idea of an afterlife, or of somehow in any respect surviving ones own death, is obviously a hugely thought over and discussed point, possibly the most in history. It seems to rely however on there being something in the body (some might call it 'soul' or 'spirit') that is somehow separate from the whole. When a human dies, the physical body decays, inevitably. Therefore, something must exist beyond physical realms. Furthermore, this spiritual something must carry and bare hallmarks of the individual it 'belongs to'. Forgive my cynicism, but such a thing, as far as all material evidence and cold logic is concerned, does not exist, furthermore most likely *cannot* exist in this physical world we inhabit. 

The idea of surviving ones own death is, to the best of my beliefs, the pinnacle of wishful thinking, as anyone can see. Obviously most people would sincerely wish to live past there death, or more so that loved ones might who have already died, and this leads us to hypothesise on ways that it may be possible, giving rise to various things that is a whole different discussion in itself.

Some may say this view is cynical or I must be a pretty miserable/depressed person to hold such a view. However I see this life, and my youth, as hugely significant and precious beyond words because I know it will never come again, I have one chance to live a full and worthy life, I better not waste it! I encourage at every opportunity anyone else to think on the issue along those lines. Obviously given the choice almost everyone would want to have an afterlife, but consider for a moment that one day you will breath your last, and that will be the end. Doesn't that fill you with the appreciation for the miracle that is the body you inhabit and how amazing and precious it is, to be alive. </TEXT>
