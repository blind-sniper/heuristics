<DATE> 2015-06-07 17:47:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (Haven't read books, only watched show)

When Daenerys finally OK'd the fighting pits, she did so because they were now "free" do so. The logic used to defend them was that it was tradition   these fighters wanted to do it. 

Yet, 2 episodes ago, we saw a slave trader selling people who were chained up   told to fight to their death.  They did so right in front of the Queen who was in attendance (begrudgingly). What gives?

<TEXT> w/ software updates (via XB1) it's better than it was at launch (be sure to update controller when it's plugged in)

I bought one a month ago through MSFT store for $47. 

It's comfortable. In fact, very comfortable (I use it for more than XB1 now). I have it on for hours   never bugs me (rare for a headset)

Sounds great (no surround; only stereo). It's Polk, they make some of THE best speakers around. 

Yes, the built in mic isn't as great as others... So, register it @ Polk's site w/ the yellow paper that's packed. 

Then look at their support page. Find the email they post to like EVERY complaint about mic sound. Email them w/ address, Serial Number, phone # etc...

I did it, got a new (free) mic in 2 days shipped (free). 

Some say their 4 shot now comes w/ headset adapter, mine didn't. I actually like the adapter, has a great mic   awesome cord to connect to controller (the material is soft   doesnt' seem to get in the way).

It's a great headset. Especially at that price, it's THE best XB1 wired headset I've used. You can spend $250+ on a wireless Turtle Beach w/ surround, but that's up to you. Enjoy.

There is an impending Y2K-like time bomb waiting to explode in the healthcare system because of all these "cute" names parents are coming up with these days. Giving your kids three middle names, double hyphenated last names, siblings with phonetically similar names, or naming twins almost the exact same thing WILL result in errors in their medical records. Oh, and quit using symbols, apostrophes, and other non alpha characters. They don't play well with today's electronic health records.

it's a shame, but good luck getting jobs. Your kids wont' get good jobs with names employers can't pronounce. They won't even make it into an interview.  </TEXT>

For example, take Roger Ailes, Cheney,   Rumsfield. They've been involved since the Nixon administration in EVERY republican seat holder. While experienced, they've made careers of getting their way in smokey rooms. Term limits should be applied to these positions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even as a kid, I felt Jedi kinda sucked... compared to the original 2. 

Lucas came back in the fold a bit with Jedi. It was originally 'Revenge of the Jedi'.

But then he got to thinking about his (new) children. He became soft. He didn't understand the difference between a movie being 'kid friendly'   'for kids'. 

He changed the name to 'Return'   the tone. He replaced a planet of wookies   replaced them with ewoks (easier to sell toys). He changed Luke's approach at Jabba's palace. He didn't realize his movies weren't kid movies, just movies kids enjoy. He did what he's prone to do   made it weak. 

Take the Greedo scene in IV. Greedo is a bad guy who's gonna kill Han if Han doesn't come with him. He's got a gun drawn on him (he's gonna shoot first, but Han beat him to it). Yet, Lucas became a Dad   suddenly thinks kids can't understand the situation. Even as a kid, I thought VI was crap (compared to originals)   wasn't surprised with the prequels... 

If you make something aimed directly at kids, it's gonna suck for adults.  The secret is make it something you can take a child to watch but made for everyone. Don't spoon-feed the kids, don't dumb it down, don't think they can't understand/appreciate it. 

(BTW: when will they include the Han/Leia wedding footage? When they test screened 'Revenge of the Jedi' there was a wedding at the end... ) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Postmates: company tells their drivers not to tip on food orders </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-12 01:03:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work at a restaurant in Austin, TX. I have at least 5 togo orders / day from Postmates (a delivery service which operates in multiple cities). 

Over the past year, we have never gotten a tip from any of their drivers. I have spoken with other food service employees from other restaurants who gripe about how they never tip   come in multiple times per day. 

I have several years experience in food service. It's common for their drivers to brag about how much money they make (decent amount)   inquire how I should apply to work for Postmates. 

Today, a driver opened up   said "I'd like to tip you but I can't... I finally found out why they don't tip:

* Postmates instructs them not to tip...ever. 

This company who makes money from the food service industry in multiple cities explicitly instructs their drivers to never tip using company credit cards...

(BTW: If you are a driver, you can tip cash... I know it's togo, but at least a dollar. Most everyone in this industry tips, even on togo)

<TEXT> OK, sounds like something from the National Enquirer, right next to the wolfman elvis...

I've been following these Romanian kids (the Stroes) for a couple years. Their father (a fitness freak) has been making these kids work out at least 2 hours a day since they were barely able to walk... I've even got a google news alert about them. I find it interesting (one of them holds the world record for vertical pushups   some other record). Of the numerous articles I've read / watched, this is the first mention of a 'mutation' I've ever read... I tried to cross reference that condition with results of the kids   came up with nothing.

I know that condition exists, but I'm sure their bodies are the result of hard work   not being mutants.

US money has been funneled out of the country   into the hands of gangsters   crime lords. It's a huge violent fight to control this source of insane income. Mexico has crime syndicates that have to house US money is different houses it's so rampant   abundant. This prohibition has funded this criminal takeover of Mexico... the US has created it.

They say, "Oh, I haven't read that"

<TEXT> In 1999, a year before the 2000 election, I began tinkering with the idea of a site that would match a person with their best suggested politician. 

The idea was to let a person take a political litmus test   get matched with a politician. It wouldn't be a social network (the user would have the same privacy you have in a voting booth). The test(s) would be as in depth as the user was willing to go. Daily quizzes / questionnaires / polls. The site would also link users to potential blogs, articles, resources, charities, or anything relative to the users interests. 

I worked on this project for several years. I met with programmers, political science instructors, politicians, message boards, etc. The plan was to work on a major election (presidential)   work our way down to local level politics.

Then a couple years ago a programmer I had tried to enlist sent me this link. I knew instantly that someone had beaten me to the punch. 

I recommend this site for anyone trying to make an informed decision. It's an excellent tool. I urge you not to vote with your gut. Don't blindly support one party. Don't vote based on income, class, etc. Don't make a decision as important a vote without some research. Hopefully this will help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> well put. I 100% agree with you: getting tired of replaying this game, having to  'work' to get stuff (I say work, because it's taking up a lot of my time), which is common of MMOs...

But: compare Destiny to Halo (what we primarily know Bungie for):

The Destiny story has more play ability than any Halo campaign. I usually play a Halo campaign once on Legendary co-op, another solo Legendary,   usually various sittings to get achievements. We can up the difficulty to Destiny's missions (not different, but harder) but we could also add skulls to Halo missions. 

Since launch, I've played Destiny's story more than any Halo campaign (  I'm a pretty huge Halo fan)   it's only been a couple of weeks. But, I'm tiring of it. I'm eager to anything new: DLC, missions, etc... After one week of playing, I had completed the story   then the level 20 'work' started. 

So far, we got 4 (large) Forge worlds (with AI spawns)   a tower map. 

Next, Multiplayer: Halo's MP has always been the true replay value. Destiny's MP is OK. Vehicles are terrible. Destiny's MP is fun, but the only purpose is to get Crucible points   perhaps upgrades. (When MCC comes, I can't imagine Destiny will be in my sights)

So far, I would say I've already gotten my $60 out of Destiny, but I too thought there would be more content. 

Good luck with the fanboys. They are the ones that think they speak for Bungie (speak for yourselves you sheep!).

I, too, worry about the Activision connection. Surly (not Shirley) Bungie took the preventable measures. Activision has a rep of nickel   diming us to death   taking IPs away from publishers.

<TEXT> nobody ever feigned outrage over Bush W. it was genuine. there wasn't speculation, it was grounded in facts. nobody imagined that he was born in a far away land (although he actually wasn't from Texas). fear-mongering is all about 'what ifs'. the GOP is all about imagining what they are up against. 

the democrats are for policy where as GOP is for philosophy
http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6131919/democrats-and-republicans-really-are-different

one party is attracted to tangible results   the other is attracted to something in their gut. what is it with the GOP   them not believing in science, facts, or anything laid out in front of them in favor of made up hypothesis or religion? 

they're not focused on helping the people the people who elected them so much as they are on getting their way (  staying in power). they'd rather monkeywrench DC for 2 Obama terms than do a job. come 2016, they're hoping voters blame Obama for their lack of attention. they'll do anything to win an election EXCEPT have a proven track record   run an honest campaign...all at the expense of the public.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to live down the street from the Jehovah Witness 'church'. Every Saturday morning, a group of little ole ladies would walk out to convert but would always go straight to my house. (never a different neighborhood...)

Usually, I would have bartended till very late Friday night   would come home after the bar closed   would pass out playing video games somewhere around dawn on the couch. Around 8am, they'd knock, I'd have to put on pants   hear their spill about their faith. I'd smile, take their pamphlet (while my Jack Russell would be begging to eat them up at my feet),   go immediately back to sleep....

BUT: after 10 times, I decided to skip the pants   straight up answer the door in my boxers... it was half way through their speech when I noticed my morning wood had made it out the tent   was distracting them. 

They never came back.

Don't hit them too much too often, they'll hide / unlike. 3 Posts / day is too much for some followers. 

You may want to consider different facebook pages: your bar, events, etc...

Be consistent: don't miss having specials announced every day (at same time)

Be open to feedback. Research customer service   marketing to learn how to deal with feedback   negative comments.

Link Facebook pages to Google Ads. 

Cross promote w/ Twitter, Instagram, ETC

<TEXT> For those keeping score, they have actively tried to sway the public from video files (proven by the fact the XBOX ONE doesn't have a very basic feature, not difficult at all to implement). 

Music files are still accessible because people still buy music files. Go use Microsoft MUSIC   you'll see that it's poorly implemented though...

WMC from Win 7  Win 8 was nerfed. It's hammerheaded to use now that I've upgraded. 

WMC that was initially on 360   the WMC after the last update is shotty. 

- It's one of the only apps not pinnable to homescreen (actively made difficult to access). 
- Never appears in recent apps (again, so it's not convenient to use). 

The scope of their business is not limited to other computer OSs. Now, that they are in the Digital Rights business, I stand by my ground that they actively are avoiding this feature. 

So, no, I don't they are 'working' on making the XBOX One able to pull media files from a PC/Network. They are 'working' on going out of their way to avoid it. The reason we don't have it isn't because the people at Redmond can't get it to work yet... It could be done fairly easy. 

  Yes, I think they will eventually release it (read: begrudgingly). it will be because they have to due to pressure from fan base (thanks to threads like this) or else it's a feature all their competitors have, so they will as well.  </TEXT>

same as Windows Media Center. MSFT assumes all video files are pirated movies.

They used to be in the PC business, but now they are selling digital rights. They're partnering with studios to sell TV / Movies. Except they aren't as cheap or convenient as, say, Amazon. 

Media files bought for 360 aren't accessible on the XB1. Other vendors sell digital rights for the lifetime of the user   on every platform for future generations. MSFT will have to make some changes if they are to survive this. 

MSFT is actively preventing this. They market the Xbox One as THE media center but it can't even pull files from a PC/Network... </TEXT>

<TEXT> for starters, MSFT was initially perceived as a monopoly before they had any real competition. have huge success   you draw out the haters... 

MSFT has opportunity after opportunity to do the right thing, but they usually balk. they make a bonehead decision   then their competitors do the right thing,   suddenly MSFT is on board. they 'see the light' 

EX: digital rights. People who bought items for their 360 don't have access to them on the XB1. Most other companies offer digital rights for a lifetime per user. They also offer that license across all their platforms   future generations... You're seeing MSFT starting to change this strategy (like they usually do)

Also, you don't see MSFT being as innovative as expected. They allow other companies to take the risk with the early adopters, but then they swoop in with their service.

I'm not a fan of Apple. They make their apps (quicktime, iTunes) intentionally run shitty on PCs. People blame the PC (MSFT, Windows) but it's usually the apps they choose to install being poorly designed / supported. (IE is a crappy browser compared to others). 

Speaking of, Apple people (read: cult) talk about how great the experience is, how well it runs, but Apple users are limited to what they can install. PC users have more freedom. If they don't install crap apps, they'd find windows isn't bad as an OS. 

Apple uses propitiatory hardware   jack up the prices. You can get a PC laptop waaay cheaper than an apple laptop. Apple cables are expensive. 

 I think iTunes is crap. They offer DRM riddled files. Opt for the files without the DRM into it   they charge you more? 

Zune was far superior to iPod. People still laugh when I give them a ride...

<TEXT> If you are running Vista or XP, odds are that Windows 9 won't run well on that ancient computer. If this is some marketing ploy, the slow performance isn't much of a game changer. Also, odds are they don't know how to install new OSs or else they'd done it by now... only non-techies are running those OSs. 

If you are going to reward anyone, how about those who have supported MSFT more frequently? Incentive to remain loyal customers... 

Assuming this is true, why do companies offer deals to new customers   screw over existing ones? Grow a reputation of taking care of your customers is the best sway to get new ones   retain the old... </TEXT>

I ran across your posts about this job opportunity. How would you prefer someone to send you a resume? 

Also, what is the name of your business? Where are you located?

This is a great opportunity to advertise your business (I'm a marketing guy   like tea).

<TEXT> Microsoft - Digital rights should work across all your devices: XBOX   Windows. 

It's apparent you're focusing your business on selling licenses: VIDEO / MUSIC apps   your marketplace. You're trying to get in on a major shift in media. People are turning from physical media to digital rights. You need to establish a better reputation than this. You are F'n Microsoft! 

When people buy from you, they need to know:

- the license is valid a lifetime for the user
- the license works across all your devices during that lifetime 

If you don't, you'll lose out to Sony, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc...   then you'll put out a press release like you always do saying 'now MSFT sees the light'... the market will speak. 

Your goal should be to retain users between upgrades, yet you've made several decisions to give established users reservations about your service.

I remember your mission statement being about synergy between products, but not anymore.

<TEXT> Traffic is terrible. Quite possibly the worst complaint about the city. There's over a hundred people moving here a day. I'm sure there's other tax revenues that can pay for roads.

Toll roads are barely used. I won't use them, it's a luxury tax. I'm not convinced the $.25/mile (whatever the rate) they're receiving is more than the cost of people's lives being wasted in gridlock. 

How much does the TxTag system cost to operate vs it's revenue? In 2012, MnPass (Minnesota's version) cost $2.4 million to operate and only earned $3 million in revenue. 

If they'd just let us all use all the roads, it'll pay off in the long run. 

Bring in the rail system, quit fighting public transit options,   share the roads...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to Mjr Nelson

- http://majornelson.com/2014/07/07/this-weeks-deals-with-gold-xbox-360-ultimate-games-sale/

Halo 4 DLC is going on sale tomorrow, right now it's $25.

Hopefully this'll spark some interest in H4 until this fall... The last DLC playlist was fun (4v4) but hopefully a BTB DLC playlist will happen (tired of playing same maps). 

Also wish this price drop was permanent, seeing how H4 is 50% off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How is XBOX (MSFT) allowing this app?

They phased out their own Windows Media Center (WMC) app because they are trying to encourage people away from physical media (audio/video) files. There is no way to pull media files from your PC/Network from the XBOX ONE. You can only push (Play to). Not much of an entertainment center (especially when the previous 360 could).

MSFT is trying to sell MUSIC/VIDEO digital rights   has partnered with major studios to do this. Also, they are trying to appease these studios that MSFT is actively fighting piracy is these tactics... 

Just don't understand why MSFT would allow this app when they have bent over backwards to make sure their own product can't pull files from their own Win 8 machines? 

On XBOX 360   Win 8, they nerfed their WMC. On 360, you couldn't view WMC as recent apps. You couldn't pin it to home. The only decent way to pull files was to hit the Guide, go to video, select from PC...

Cool to hear otherwise, much more of a XBMC fan myself. Have gotten away from files as well (why, when you can stream most everything?)

EDIT: Remember that just because you are in the ID program, doesn't mean it will be accepted by MSFT to the included in the Marketplace. Their apps aren't as easy to get into play as the apps for Win 8.  </TEXT>

A year ago, they lowered the prices for a sale. It'd be nice if they did something permanently this Summer...

http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Map_Packs

here is a history of the map packs and their prices. Halo 4 map packs are the EXACT same price today as they were brand new ($10). 

Halo 4 now sells for $30, which is 50% off the original price. 

MSFT   343 has a group of dedicated fans who wants to play their product. Despite all it's shortcomings, seems people are practically begging to be able to play   enjoy it... 

When Halo 5 comes out, what incentive do we have to buy the DLC maps? I'm sure I will, but I'll have reservations about doing so. For a game like Halo, it should be a no brainer.

<TEXT> compared with other Halo releases, Halo had the lowest amount of maps available at launch. DLC maps would help remedy that. 

If they want to stimulate people into buying Halo 5   it's DLC (  Anniversary edition if true), this'd be a good way. If they'd make them free, it'd definitely be goodwill. 

I know a lot of people who never played Halo 4 after the Title Update. This would be great to bring some of them back.

<TEXT> Outside of the Map Pack Playlist (which don't exist anymore):

Do any of you ever get to play the DLC maps in rotation? 

I know if you go in with a party who ALL have the maps, then they appear more frequently. What about those who paid for the maps   don't have friends who play Halo 4?

Even when the game was recently released, I never saw the DLC maps other than in the DLC playlist. 

Right now, you can DL Halo 4 from xbox store for $30. You can DL map packs for $25. Since Halo 5 is on the horizon, you think the maps should be lowered in price? 

If so: think 343 could require DLC maps for certain playlist? 

Compared to other Halo releases, Halo 4 had the smallest amount of maps available at launch. Sure, they've got some forge maps, but it'd be great to be able to play the maps we paid for. It'd be great to have some variety.  </TEXT>

If you answered YES to all the above questions then you should buy the season pass. 

Usually, studios save the best maps for purchase. This is the cheapest season pass for any game I've seen, seems like a bargain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i like Titanfall but one of my gripes about the game is that what is on my screen isn't necessarily on my deathscreen. 

Example: I'll be on a roof, barely sticking my head over the top to get a shot, I'll be shot,   in my deathscreen I'll be standing fully exposed deserving attention... 

Glad I wasn't imagining it...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> MSFT is phasing out Media Center. If you notice, the latest 360 versions   Win 8 WMC have less features than before. on the 360, you can't find it in recent items   can't pin it...

MSFT is pushing their Video/Music store product. Also, with their partnerships with studios, they have to show they are trying to combat piracy. 

MSFT will get creamed by SONY partially b/c of this. there's no way to pull media files on the XB1 from network/PC. they want you to go through their apps first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> About ready for Parks   Rec to wrap it up. Beginning to feel like The Office after Carell left. 

I watched every episode of The Office week to week but kept asking myself why. It's time could be watching something else. It already felt stretched out at the end before he left. 

Parks   Rec (like most shows) is doing over 20 episodes a year. Used to, 13 was a normal season for a sitcom. Think how England usually does 6-8   they hardly ever do more than 2-3 seasons. Normally, they take more than a year between to create content. Just seems like they stretch shows out. 

Glad Community is back. Last season, I felt like I was over it, but this season is great. Still, thinking it may have another season before they should walk away.  

Go On was great, but haven't liked much else on NBC. Kind of feel like the sitcom it worn out. CBS gets great numbers, buth they're terrible. It's like the Leno of sitcoms. It's just as 'edgy' as the same sitcoms I watched in the 70's. I think CBS only puts up great numbers because their demographic is old people. They all agree CBS is safe enough to watch. CBS is on every TV in every retirement home, every hospital lobby,   they probably fell asleep after wheel of fortune...

Was surprised how good the IT Crowd was yet not much recognition. Of course, they tried to redo it in USA. The pilot was EXACTLY the same. Why not just put up the original? Besides simply being great, community is great because it's not so formulaic. You know, the same thing network execs don't encourage while looking at the numbers. 

Nothing created will be great without risk. With large data, companies are taking less   less risk in every market. Everything is so calculated. Poor Heat Vision   Jack, you never had a chance...

<TEXT> Before the XBOX 360 launch, the AVG price of a game was $50.
Then they raised it to $60 saying they needed to because of increase of console life (was AVG 3 years, 360 = 8 years). Fine.
Then a couple years later, the Entertainment Software Assoc said the price of games could come back down to $50. Nope, didn't happen. The market determined that buyers were willing to pay $60. 

Disc-less, on demand games surely would be cheaper. No packaging, no shipping, no storage,   no middle men. Who cares about retail   Gamestop? Who buys games from mom   pops?

If I could pay $40 (or less) on midnight of launch   DL immediately, I could live without something physical. It's not like there was art in the case. It's not like the argument for Vinyl when .mp3s were taking over CDs. 

Surely, the developers / publishers like this model seeing how there's no way I can lend, trade, or sell it off. 

MSFT can come up with a model where direct games on demand sold at a lower price, they can still get equal or better profits... Just seems to reason that lower price equals more units sold.  </TEXT>
