<TEXT> I have a two year old and have started watching more kid's TV and movies. I have a strict no crap policy (Lilo and Stitch YES, Lilo and Stitch 2 NO) and am loving watching a generation of movies I missed.

This morning we watched half of Bolt before I dropped her at childcare then I came home and watched the second half by myself. 

So what other great kid's movies have I missed?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got a response: 

********

OMG what rock did you crawl out from under down under?

Talk to the people who actually work there, those clubs are all the same when you work in them. I mean do some real research at least. Even I've done that much and it's not my subject.

You are only a tourist, WTF would you know unless you worked there.

The clubs you are talking about like in Kings Cross in Sydney are sleazy dirt bags, because the men made them that way. Australian men are insecure around strong women, so they keep them down and call them con artists. You are calling them con artists, because you are ashamed of yourself for not realizing what the club was when you walked in there, so you blame the club and the women.

But it's the women who suffer, because you put them that much further down on the totem pole of hierarchical society.

Australia has been bleeding its most beautiful and intelligent women since year do, because of forever being put down put down put down. You make everything sleazy and disgusting, nobody is allowed any pride in their work, they all have to be desperate. . Also because of idiots like you writing about women being con artists, because they can't get decent paid work in the straight world. And why not, when they get told they are overqualified for a normal job in Australia, or are a con artist for trying to not be on the dole bludging off Australian tax payers or their parents.

Australia's employment and DNA problem is because of idiots like you who have no real world education and put down women who want to do better for themselves without charity.

When visitors come to Australia they see under 21 year olds who can't handle their alcohol in the bars causing fights; really good look for Australia that is. This doesn't happen in California because the age for drinking is 21, when humans are physically and mentally better able to handle substances, and in Europe they simply have better educations.

Overseas, Australian men are an embarrassment. They can't handle their alcohol and they don't know how to act around strong women, or in public.

Write a book about that and you might have an international best seller. There are lot more strong women than men outside of Australia, plus all the Ozzy anything fans, they'd love reading it.

Get out of the gutter, as you really don't know what is there, because you are only a tourist. You are complaining of the same thing you are doing, being a con artist, selling false information.

Write about what you know, which is idiot Australian men.

FYI: My day job is audience development for writers.

Let me know when you are working on that book, I may be interested in helping you.

It has been brought to my attention that not every channel on a mixer will necessarily have a preamp meaning I can't plug a microphone in every channel and get the same output.

<TEXT> My name is Nicholas J. Johnson. For those who don't know I'm an author, magician and skeptic who performs The Bad Science Show at high schools around Australia.

I teach kids about critical thinking using magic, comedy and sideshow stunts. Australian skeptics might remember me as the con man from the Skeptics Convention last year.

I'm revamping The Bad Science Show at the moment would love some impact on what you think are the important issues facing young people in skepticism. It could be a particular issue such as vaccination or more general concept such as the need for empirical study.

I currently discuss psychics, placebo effects, gurus, ghost sightings, pareidolia, water divining etc.

Love your input!

<TEXT> In this thread there are a lot well meaning people saying that if only LGBT people today dressed conservatively or acted with class then they would be taken more seriously.

One of the key elements to the whole Gay Pride movement is for people to be proud of who they ARE. So they dress up in revealing, camp costumes because that is who they are. They express themselves.

Tellng gay people you can't take them seriously if they don't act 'more straight' is kind of messed up.

About five years ago I shot the Australia series of The Real Hustle and we pull that exact scam in an Australian jewellery shop. There was no bishop involved but the basic scam was the same. I played the cop and had a fake badge designed by the Channel 9 props team even though police in my state don't carry badges.

<TEXT> That sucks. When I was teenager, my hair was a big part of my identity and, as I slowly lose it, I feel a real loss of control over my body. It's not vanity, it's just a sense you can't make decision about how you look.

I can't imagine what it feels likes at your age.

If you've still got eyebrows etc. I would consider growing a beard. All my female friends agree that that look is fucking hot. 

If that's not an option, I'd look a various hat options but I would try and avoid making it look like you're trying to hide it. 

Depending on your head shape, have a look at glasses as an option to break up your face.

<TITLE> ELI5: Why do people hate hipsters? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-12 11:06:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hipsters discover music, food, fashion and make all the stupid mistakes so we don't have to. 

They're mostly harmless, at worst snobby but usually quite friendly.

Why all the hate?

TL;DR Answers from the thread.

1) They are pretentious and snobby toward non-hipsters

2) They a parasitic, consuming instead of creating.

3) They create small, exclusive cultural ghettos.

4) There behaviours are based social pressure and not real love or passion for a topic.

It's the same story told in Lolita and, to a lesser extent, American Beauty.

<TEXT> I loved the original 1988 Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDA0K_dIhxk

Ocean's 11 has all but killed the memory of the Rat Pack original.

The 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers is way better than the 1956 original.

Same with True Grit, The Fly and John Carpenter's The Thing, that all outshine their 1950's originals.

There's also a tonne of French films that have been surpassed in popularity (if not quality) by their originals. True Lies, The Bird Cage, Three Men and a Baby and Down and Out in Beverly Hills.

<TEXT> Some form of religion is practiced by the vast majority of this planet. The idea that, regardless of the validity of their beliefs, that those people get no sort of benefit from their rituals and practices is hard to believe.

These rituals, ideas and beliefs were not created by a magical man in the sky but by real people with real needs and desires. 

The stories we tell and create reflect who we are as people. The evil that religions do is created by people, as is the good.

I'm sure the redpill and MRA douchnozzles are trying their darnedest to find some sense of male identity. But, like so many douchenozzles before them they are doing so by creating an imaginary enemy. 

In my day, you just jerked off and played Doom until three in the morning. But these pricks, that's some tyler durden level delusion. 

EDIT: Never mind. Had a look at your profile. I didn't realise how deep down the rabbit hole you were. I hope you find some peace in the world and work through your problems without hurting too many people along the way. All best.

Caleb always knows she is a machine and so it could never be such a test. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always thought it was a satire, poking fun at modern masculinity and consumer culture. Today, in an age of MRA and redpills and rapey frat boys it is more relevant than ever.

But I know so many young men who take it seriously. Much like the stockbrokers who love Wall Street or gangsters who quote Goodfellas.

Polanski is scumbag and deserves prison.

<TEXT> In smaller communities, the scammers need to go undetected and run scams in which the victim is unaware they have been taken for a ride.

One of the criteria that con artists seek out is situations in which their victims are compelled to trust them. For example, older people are scammed more often than younger people not because they are gullible but, as you age and become more separated from your community, you need to trust others more.

A canny con man could very easily take advantage of the levels of trust that are necessarily built up in small communities. 

For example, if there is only one butcher in town, you're less likely to question the quality and source of his meat.

The earliest versions of the scam, which dates back 500 years, was much the same as today. The con man needs to rescue a spanish prisoner held prisoner with her vast fortune in a foreign land. If you'll pay for the rescue mission, the money and the girl are yours.

We had Fight Club, American Beauty and The Matrix but, while fantastic, none of those films are particularly ground breaking. 

The year was also packed full of films by filmmakers who had done better. Phantom Menace, Eyes Wide Shut, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Tarzan, The World Is Not Enough, Notting Hill....

1999 was a year for playing it safe, limping to end of the lackluster nineties.

Also, Wild Wild West.

<TEXT> I'm performing in Guinea Pigs at Melbourne International Comedy Festival. 

We've had great crowds and great reviews (Here's one: http://www.melbartsfash.com/109918) until now but, on Tuesday night we've got the Herald Sun coming in.

For some reason, people actually read the Herald Sun reviews so we'd like to stack the deck with our kind of crowd. 

Check out the description below and, if it tickles you, hit me up in my inbox for a free double pass.

http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2014/season/search?q=Jonestown submit=

EDIT: We had over fifty responses and all the tickets are gone! Thanks! However, please feel free to send me a message anyway in case we need to paper the room on any other nights. If you'd like to come on Tuesday night anyway, it is tight arse Tuesday and tickets are already super cheap.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much to everyone who came. We had a full house in the end which was fantastic. We even had two guide dogs in the front row. https://www.facebook.com/GuideDogZeke?fref=ts

<TEXT> I know that both percent or per cent are correct but what about 'per centage'?

The in-house style guide insists on per cent.

Should I also use per centage? 

EDIT: Just to provide more context, this is in a piece of dialogue in a second novel. In the first book, the publisher used per cent. The word percentage did not occur.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What do you think of the decision to change the ethnicity of the Attack On Titan characters from European to Japanese? </TITLE>

<TEXT> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i41ZKisDeoE

The original story is set in Europe and draws from European history, politics, landscape and architecture.

The titans stride through cobblestone streets between Georgian houses and buildings, smashing churches. By making the characters Japanese, a lot of what made the series unique gets lost.

Do you think the film could suffer in the same way The Last Airbender suffered?

An original show offers Netflix prestige, publicity and air of quality that 20 year old repeats won't.

Our population is made up of a lot of european migrants who insisted on good coffee when they came here in the 50s and 60s. 

I have to admit I struggled to find coffee the way I like it in the US. I think Americans drink their coffee weaker than other countries, but drink more of it. 

I loved the jugs of drip coffee at the gas stations with the racks of syrups and creamers (I still don't know what that stuff is).

<TEXT> In the Worlds before Monkey,
Primal chaos reigned, Heaven sought order.
But the Phoenix can fly only when its feathers are grown.
The four worlds formed again and yet again,
As endless aeons wheeled and passed.
Time and the pure essences of Heaven,
The moistures of the Earth,
And the powers of the Sun and the Moon
All worked upon a certain rock - old as Creation,
And it magically became fertile.
That first egg was named Thought,
Tathagata Buddha, the Father Buddha,
Said, 'With our thoughts we make the world.'
Elemantal forces caused the egg to hatch,
from it then came a stone Monkey.
The nature of Monkey was irrepressable! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! That is super helpful. 

For me, I'd say my goals are:-

1) Increase overall number of visitors to my website.

2) Increase visitors requesting more information on my services as an entertainer/speaker for corporate and private functions.

3) Increase sales of my novel.

4) Reflect my personality and the personality of my performance and writing in my online presence.

5) Increase social media followers.

As a designer, do they sound clear enough for you?

<TEXT> That's right! I'll just walk over to the ticket machine here on the tram...oh it's gone. That's OK, I'll just get one at the next stop...not there either. 

If someone lives nowhere near a 7/11 or a train station, they can not use public transport. 

And even if you carry a fully topped up card with you at all times, the machines STILL will often not scan properly and, unless you go to extraordinary measures, you have no way to prove it.

<TEXT> I'd have no problem with ticket inspectors handing out fines to fare evaders if they still had a system that made it, you know, possible to buy a fare.

I live near a large hotel, on a train line, that is three kilometres from the nearest 7/11. At least once a week, without fail, I see tourists standing at the tram stop looking worried. 

I'll often ask if they are OK and they ask where they can buy a ticket. I sigh and being to explain....

It's great for my mental health but shocking for weight. I crave sugar all the time and my metaloblism has slowed right down. 

I put on 2 kilos in a fortnight (about five pounds) and so I started dieting but I just can't shift the weight. I also have a one year old daughter I look after most of the time which makes exercise hard (but not impossible)

Any hints or tips? </TEXT>

You get one chance to release a film, maybe two if the producers completely ruin the original work ala The Wicker Man.

They're just living their lives doing what makes them happy, hurting no one. Who am I to tell them they can't explore all of life's opportunities and wonders just because some stranger thinks they're trying too hard or that they are too pretentious.

All that said, put some fucking shoes on.

Since then, a man named Jason Voglis from the agency has not stopped calling me and emailing me with sales calls and spam. 

I tried calling his boss AND Ray White head office but nothing much seems to happen. 

EDIT: Had a call from his boss today saying I should have been taken off the list and that he couldn't explain what was going on. I rattled off everything you guys had mentioned below. He seem a bit rattled. Hopefully that's it. 

EDIT 2: Nope. Wasn't it. Still got more emails.

<TEXT> With a lot of music, the words themselves don't require literal meaning. Instead it's how they *sound* that gives the song meaning or emotion.

A lot of hip hop is best compared to nonsense verse like Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll or even the experimental works of James Joyce. "

All mimsy were the borogoves / and the mome raths outgrabe." in Jabberwocky doesn't make a lot of sense but sounds great just like "scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap" doesn't mean a damn thing when Ghostface Killah raps it.

In hop hop, the focus is often on the rhythm and lyricism of the words, not what they are saying. I would imagine the trend comes from freestyle rap where in order to keep up with the beat, the rapper drops in nonsense words or words that make no sense in that context.

TL;DR - "The sound of the words is more important than the meaning" said the whitest man ever.

<TEXT> Thanks, that was brilliant. 

I struggle to find quality designers for my sites. The last great site I had was eight years ago and that company was bought out my a larger operation and their prices increased by 500%. Now, i'm stuck trying to find a good designer who can help me with what I want.

I feel like the only choices I have is to pay $2000-$3000 for a site that isn't what I want or $9 per month for a site that isn't amazing but that I can, at the very least, fiddle with until it limps into usable. 

It's a problem that others in my industry face with many designer their own sites. The two guys I know with great sites by great developers got mates rates from a friend.

<TEXT> What about the templates are unprofessional? As a non-designer, I can see sites I do and don't like but I'm not sure what makes them unprofessional.

I have several people in my market with wix sites on the front page of google who've done only basic SEO. I've done a little reading on Ajax crawling and it seems to get the job done.

I've seen terribly designed wordpress sites, many using templates, made by amateurs out of their depth who just don't understand WP's complexities. 

What about a WP site helps non-designers make their own sites easier than wix?

<TEXT> Wix seems to get a lot of hate here. As a non-designer, I struggle to nail people down on EXACTLY what is bad about the site.

For me, the big downside is that anyone can make their own site, which means people who don't know design end up with a dull template OR a design of their own that stinks.

It puts web design in the hands of people who have no business designing sites.

However, if a user has a keen eye for design and doesn't need to complex a site, what is the problem with using Wix?

EDIT: I think I have a better understanding now of the problems a designers have with. Broadly speaking, I see a lot of parallels between this issue and publishing/self-publishing. A lot of publishers get very annoyed with self-published books. The quality is low, they are packed full of mistakes and they price traditional publishers out of the business. However, publishers have had to learn to suck it up and learn to live in a DIY world. Perhaps web designers will too.

<TEXT> I figured out the the big difference between Australian and American coffee, aside from the style, was the strength. Often, I'd dismiss coffee as being bad when, in reality, it was just week. 

My favourite coffee experience of the trip was at service station half way between LA and Vegas where they had 10 different pots of coffee on the boil, twelve different syrups, six different types of "milk", four types of sweetener and a selection of whipped creams, sprinkles, chocolate etc. 

It summed up the American experience for me. It's a country founded on choice, where they'd rather have a thousand terrible choices than two or three good ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Australians have a rep for being picky (i.e. assholes) when it comes to coffee. 

While I was in New York I tried to find the best coffee place I could. Some hipsters recommended this little hole in the wall near Chelsea Market. Just a counter, a coffee machine and beans. 

The Barista was a massive douche to every single person in line. Soup Nazi levels. 

When we got to the front of the line and he heard our accents his face went white.

"You Australians?"
"Yep."
"From Melbourne?"
"Uh-huh"
"Ok...well...I'll do my best OK?"

<TEXT> Of course, there are several vaguely unsatisfying theories about how he escaped.

1) Few pantries can be locked from the outside. There is a handle on the door. He could have simply let himself out.

2) The axe. We never see where the axe came from. Perhaps he found it in the room.

3) He never escaped. He froze to death in the unheated room and the chase through the maze was his crazed mind created a reason for the lowering temperature.

4) Danny let him out and he knew the maze well enough to get in and out, leaving Jack stuck in the middle. He wanted to kill Jack.

<TEXT> The trouble both films have is [spoilers](#s "making it believable that the two leads could be forced into falling in love. In the original, they resort to "because hypnosis is magic" which works reasonably well and we suspend our disbelief. In the remake, I just don't buy that his plan could be so reliant on the pair sleeping together. There are so many "But what if" moments for it to really work. ") </TEXT>

It makes no sense, isn't particular funny AND, if you watch the ending on the DVD, it is exactly the same as the final scene, it just slows down and fades to black with Stiller jumping around having won.

<TEXT> Perhaps if you are a wild animal or a human long ago.

The beauty of human's evolution of the past few thousand years is we have grown to appreciate intelligence OVER base aggression. 

It is why people, as well as physical attraction, also look for wit and intelligence. The ability to rape is not really something either men or women look for much anymore.

Probably best to remove it from the 'special skills' of your OK cupid profile.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not a gun person so please excuse my ignorance. In fact, I'm not even sure a taser *counts* as a gun.

What would happen if you pushed a Taser into a solid surface (the ground, a wall or even a person's chest) and pulled the trigger?

As I understand it, Taser cartridges have blast doors on them that swing open or blow off when the gun is fired, allowing the prongs to fly out.

http://www.taser.com/products/law-enforcement/taser-cartridges

If the Taser was pushed up against a solid surface, I can't see how those doors could open.

NOTE: This is different from the stun gun that REQUIRES you push the gun up against someone.

<TEXT> Wordpress, I believe the visual editor, keeps removing linebreaks from some of my posts.

Sometimes it removes everything leaving me with a single block of text.

Sometimes it removes all line breaks from just tables.

I've searched high and low and not been able to find a solution.

<TEXT> Sorry, that won't work.

The mentos reaction occurs because the surface of mentos are covered in tiny simples. Each dimples serves as a nucleation point for carbon dioxide in the coke. The gas gathers around each little dimple making a bubble.

If the dimples are filled with water/ice then you'll get no bubbles.

Try filling a DRY glass with coke. You get lots of foam because there is lots of dust and other imperfections. Now fill a WET glass with coke. Very few bubbles.

Stupid jerk science ruining my fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not really interested in ranking them. Even the weakest film is still pretty damn good. 

Also, each move builds on the strengths of that which went before. By itself, The Avengers would be a bit of a mess. Wait? Who is this doctor and why is everyone scare of of him? Why is turning into a monster? There is a norse GOD and no one is surprised? 

But, as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's amazing, a calumniation of years of work and billions of dollars invested. 

There really has been nothing like it in the history of cinema.

<TEXT> As I mentioned in another thread, a good twist is one were the twist is entirely natural and, in hindsight, makes perfect sense but still blindsides the reader. 

In most cases, a good twist also changes how we FEEL rather than what we know. For example, we HATE the evil Jekyll in Jekyll   Hyde and feel for the put upon doctor. When we find out they are the same man, it changes how we feel about the two characters.  

Chuck Palanuik reused that same twist in Fight Club but, because he changed how we felt about the characters, in felt fresh and not cliched.

There are many stories in which we learn the hero is, in reality, dead. The only successful ones are those in which we care about the hero and his or her plight.

<TEXT> My editor described this to me as 'gotcha' moments rather than 'a-ha' moments. 

A 'gotcha' moment is one where the audience is surprised with a new piece of information that they could not have seen coming, one that appear as if from nowhere. For example, the end of the 2001 Planet of the Apes film. 

An 'a-ha!' moment is one where the twist or development is surprisingly but, with the benefit of hindsight, makes perfect sense. For example, in the original Jekyll and Hyde, the twist that the two men were, in fact, one, is laid out through out the text.

<TEXT> In one book, the hero is living in the snowy woods. In others, a brother and sister are the heroes. 

They collect small, magic rocks with holes in them of various types. Some may have been wood.

The books are old, mid 70's, I think.

Sorry, that's all I have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The word orient is a western word meaning 'East'. The word is problematic because a) not all of Asia is in the 'east'. b) it is very Eurocentric as it refers to a place only it's location compared with Europe. c)  No one says Oriental anymore.

<TEXT> IF you pay, they'll want more. If you refuse to pay, they'll expose you.

The best idea would be to waste their time. Slow down the process. Ask them questions about Western Union. Make excuses. Act confused. 

There is a chance they will just expose you anyway but the scammer knows he can only expose you once and so will be unlikely to give up on you if he just thinks you're incompetent.

<TEXT> Aside from scam baiting them, there isn't a lot you can do. Depending on the country of origin, scam baiting CAN be effective in slowing down the swindlers.

If the scam came from Nigeria, chances are it's linked to organised time and all you'd be doing is wasting the time of some low level wage slave.

If the scam came from Ghana then you'd be dealing with a sole trader whose time is precious and who can't afford to waste time on red herrings and dead ends. 

Realistically, the best thing you and your friend can do is tell the story to as many people as possible. The more people who know, the harder it is for the scammers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last Action Hero, while a fun movie was panned at the time for being endemic of the bloated budget, mindless action movies of the time. Ironically, it was criticised for being the very kind of film it was trying to parody.

The project was passed from director to director and screenwriter to screenwriter taking on comedy, action and fantasy elements as it went. One minute the film is a sad tale about a boy who worships the movie, the next a rollicking adventure adventure and then suddenly a child gets thrown to his death off a building. And oh look, an animated cat.

The studio just kept throwing money and resources at the movie trying to make it into the summer blockbuster it could never be.

And then Jurassic Park was released in the same week and the whole thing fell apart. The movie, which isn't awful, was humiliated by the success of both Spielburg's film and Sleepless in Seattle.

For more, read Hit and Run by Nancy Griffin. </TEXT>

And all this is is despite the fact English IS a foreign language from, you know, England and is just one of 330 spoken in the country, over 175 of which are indigenous?

EDIT: AND, I've just learned, English isn't even the official language of America!

<TEXT> In his own words...

 The show most go on... Yesterday during one of my escape street shows... I had this happen. 
 
 I was tired up, for my friends that have not seen it, in a large canvas drawstring sack., then bound with tips ropes. Also my thumbs were taped together. I had a crowd of about 150 people watching,. 
 
 At this point I'm pretty much like an upside down spittle. 
 
 Out of nowhere this crazy guy rugby tackles me knocking me to the ground and falling on top of me. A couple of other performer came and dragged the guy off. His mate was recording it for YouTube as a stunt. They then both ran off. Somehow I regained my composure and explained to the audience and children how stupid it was. I finished the show in mega pain but full of adrenalin. I went home very sore and after not being able to lay down went the the hospital where I spent most of the night waiting to be seen(not complaining many people needed help before me) 
 
 The outcome is that he broke 2 of my ribs and I am now on very song painkillers. It will take 6 weeks to mend. 
 
 I am up after 2 hours sleep and on my way to do a gig. 
 
 If anyone sees a YouTube of this please let me know, it had been reported to the police and they are investigating cctv footage.
 


Any help would be great. Patty is the nicest man alive and does not deserve this shit. </TEXT>

"Oh god! Thank you! I'll have one more chance to hold my daughter. To say a proper goodbye to my family. I'll be able talk to Michelle. I always regretted how things ended between us. Thank you for this second chance!"

<TEXT> I read that whole storyline when it first came out. I was 13 at the time and read it at my local newsagent/newstand after school. I'd finish school, go to the shop and read a couple of pages of the latest issue until the owner told me to get lost.

It was the first comic storyline I read from start to finish and has coloured all of my reading since.

<TEXT> I work as a writer and consultant on con artists and scams so this is somewhat my specialty subject. 

Most 'real world' pickpockets lack the delicate skill of pickpocket entertainers or 'honest' pickpockets. After all, some one like Apollo will steal the watch off your wrist even after he's told you that he is going to. 

Street pickpockets rely on crowds, heavy misdirection and teamwork to steal your belongings. Entertainers have to do it under a literal spotlight.

Bob Arno is also very good but, if you're looking for a teacher, Apollo can not be beat. 

You might enjoy this annotated video I made of the opening scene of The Pickpocket (1954)

How is that not dangerous? Or cruel?

The horse racing industry know of the risk they are putting these animals into and they continue to do it.

Its a pain in the ass. Who the hell wants to be with some miserable grump because he wants to get his performance right, so you have to call him this or call him that? 

"Its so boring. Ive been with actors like that and theyre a pain in the ass, they really are. Theyre unpleasant to work with and I dont think theyre always that good either."

<TEXT> I've recently given up reading Empire and listening to film podcast because I got sick of spoilers and bad reviewes. Just because the film is called [](#s "Seeking Friend For The End Of The World") doesn't mean [](#s "the world is going to end in the movie") so don't mention that fact in the film! 

I'm also sick of the obsession with focusing on whether the reviewer liked or disliked the film. That was important when we had only papers to tell us if films were worth watching, now, with the internet, we can get a sense of quality in seconds. 

I want **real** analysis! Make me think!

We're currently looking for new acts who'd like to perform at the show. We book professional and semi-professional performers including magicians, circus performers, sideshow artists, clowns (the good ones, not the creepy American style ones), musicians with gimmick and pretty much any other skill based entertainment you can think of. 

If you know of anyone or are a performer yourself it would be great to hear from you.

I just wrote a book on them which is coming out next year.

So, if you can name a con artist movie that I haven't seen I'll give you some sweet, sweet gold. 

I'm pretty picky about what films I consider con artist movies. (Ocean's 11, The Usual Suspects, The Thomas Crown Affair don't count I'm afraid)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Often, a movie adaptation will improve on the original book. The following are films I feel are an improvement on the source material. I've used spoiler tags as most relate to the ending.

Breakfast at Tiffany's
[spoiler] (#s  "The introduction of the love interest and the rain-soaked finale makes for a cheesy conclusion but I love it all the same.")

Fight Club [spoiler](#s  " 'You met me at a very strange time in my life" and then Boom! In the books, the attacks fail and he ends up in hospital.' ")

Matchstick Men [spoiler](#s "The reunion in the carpet store and the reconciliation with the wife  after the finale twist doesn't appear in the novel and it's kind of a downer.")

Thank You For Smoking [spoiler](#s "In the film, he becomes a hero and returns to work. In the book, he becomes an anti-smoking advocate.")

First Blood [spoiler](#s "In the original novel, Rambo is the bad guy and is shot to death. In the film, he is a troubled veteran whose actions are understandable.")

The Mist [spoiler](#s "In the film, he shoots his young son in the head to save him from the monsters in the fog not realising that help the sounds he hears is the army on the way. In the book, they simply drive into the mist.")

What are your favourites?

<TEXT> Listening to the radio a few weeks back, they were talking about the 'Dumb Ways To Die' video and it's success. 

One of the guests, who works in advertising, suggested that the advertisement's goal is NOT to make people safe around trains but to make Metro more likeable. 

It's much harder to be cynical about a whimsical safety advertisement than a whimsical crappy-public-transport-authority advertisement.

<TEXT> I saw a guy ram a car with his motorcycle today and then swear at the driver. 

Sadly for him, the car was an unmarked police car and the driver and his passenger were cops.

The sirens went on and the jerk freaked out, sprinted across Bell Street and dove head first over the eight foot high fence before disappearing into the scrub around Merri Creek.

The cops took after him and the last thing I saw before the lights changed and I had to drive away was the podgy copper trying to scale the fence after him.

It was like something out of The Bill. </TEXT>

I need a talented under 18 year old musician to do three songs for a gig on 5 June. It's a variety show (comedy, magic, circus etc.) and we need a shit hot musical act. 

There is some money involved which is nice. In the past, we've had everything from piano accordions and choirs to MCs and standard covers.

<TEXT> I do a show about scams and con artists and had a gig last night at Parliament House. Security searched my bag and, after seeing what I was carrying, decided to call the police.

My evening ended with me being interrogated by the Australian Protective Services for 20 minutes while they did a background check on me. 

"But officer, I'm an HONEST con man..." didn't seem to cut it.

In hindsight, trying to bring a hammer, two nails, a sharp knife, a lock picking set, two loaded dice and a small bottle of lighter fluid into the building might have been a mistake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've three double passes to my comedy festival show.

It's looking like a quiet night and I've got the Herald Sun reviewing my show. All the other reviews have been glowing but getting a nice review in print would be great. 

The show is an expose of my time as a regular on Today Tonight and all the awful things you didn't know about that show (as well as the awful things you already do know) 

If you're keen, email me at info@conman.com.au

PS - I've tried not to make this a blantant plug for the show. I'm really just giving away some tix.

EDIT 2: - The reviewers have asked to SWAP night to WEDNESDAY! So if anyone would like to come WEDNESDAY night, please email info@conman.com.au. Obviously happy to see the comps who are coming tonight!

So i'm paying it forward and giving away some free tickets to my show at Gluttony for the next two weeks. 

We had a full house last night and comments from twitter said:

"Just saw Today Tonight. Magnificent! Highly recommend." - @screamcreative2

"go see this show! you will be surprised!" @traceymathers 

"This is a brilliant show, everyone should see this show, very smart comedy." lebby panaayiotu. 

If you'd a free double pass hit me up on email to info@conman.com.au with the date you want to come (I'm on until the 9 March).

EDIT: Thanks for the love guys. Had a few redditors come in and see the show last night. It's a tough fringe for performers so it's nice to know I have friends out there. I can spare a few more tickets if anyone missed out.  </TEXT>

The other, set after the apocalypse, sees a group of people kept in a cage while lions and tigers circle them as the new ruling class laugh at this 'reverse zoo'

it was a really disturbing satire of the politics of the time.

Send me an email at info@conman.com.au to score one of the double passes.

As such, I just can not handle complicated book keeping software. I've been using a 20 year old copy of MS Money for years which has a basic ledger (income/expense) which has finally stopped working. I'm a sole trader who provides a service.

I need to upgrade but I can't find a piece of software I can handle. All I need is to track income and expense taking into account a 10% sales tax. (GST, I'm in Australia).

I'm working on Mac if that helps.

http://movies.mmgn.com/Videos/SLEEPWALK-WITH-ME-Official-Trailer

It's only being shown at a handful of cinemas in the US and it would be awesome to bring it to Melbourne. 

Joss Wedon thinks this is a bad idea: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj6_020FFXU

<TEXT> FREE COMEDY and AMA.

In October, I'm premiring a brand spanking new show at Melbourne Fringe.

It's a stand up comedy show about the time I appeared on Today Tonight, meeting Naomi Robson and getting screwed over by the show. 

It's called 'Today Tonight, Tomorrow the World'

I'm having a test run of the show on 28 August at The Brunswick Green and I'd really like to get some complete strangers along to laugh at my jokes or throw puppies if you hate it. (please don't throw puppies. It's not their fault I'm not funny)

https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/

If anyone has any other ideas on how to get some people along to check out some free comedy, let me know.

Thanks. 

PS - You don't HAVE to hate Today Tonight but it helps.

PPS - Ask me anything about myself, Today Tonight or comedy.

EDIT - I've had 50 people email me at info@conman.com.au to book a seat. However, you might still get a seat if you just show up on the night.

<TEXT> I am super pumped.

The Melbourne Magic Festival is on next week. I just found out the first show (the gala) I'm in has sold out.

Is anyone planning on going?

Will I be stabbed in neck?
Will my friends visit me?

<TEXT> I am a magician (hoorah) performing at the Melbourne Magic Festival (hoorah) but I need some help. (boo!)

I'm looking for a 1.25 or 2 litre bottle of coke with someone's name printed on it from that promotion from late last year.

Any name will do!

If you can help, I can even get you a few tickets to a show. We've got stuff for kid's, adults, hipsters, crazy old cat ladies... </TEXT>
