<TEXT> I like the UX of it which may seem superficial but it is very important when you're searching. One of the quickest ways to frustrate someone with a search tool is by making it confusing just to use.

So far as the search, I typed in Mario Brothers 2 (looking for the 1980s game, NOT any current Wii, NDS or Gameboy games) and every post was relevant to the game I was looking for. Many search algorithms for larger engines whether it's Yahoo or Youtube (which doesn't have a good search function) do not work as well. If you type Mario Brothers 2 at Youtube, the top 10 items that come up are the aforementioned newer games.

While those with programming knowledge may have better insight, personally it works well for me.

The study cited by WSJ is old data from 1992-2003 whereas the study referenced by NASA was conducted between 1991-2011, a much wider breadth of data that includes practically an entire decade of additional information compared to the survey cited by WSJ.

If you read the NASA link it shows the reference to IOPublishing, which conducted the research of peer-reviewed journals, citing its sources and who compiled it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps, but 97 percent of climatologists have agreement on the future. Scientists have been able to, in the past, predict the future or at least identify phenomena before there was direct evidence of it. Charles Darwin looked at an orchid once with a nectary that was 12 inches deep inside the flower. He hypothesized that their must be a butterfly species with a 12-inch probiscus that would be needed to pollinate the flower. Eventually, said butterfly was discovered.

Haley of course, predicted the reemergence of the comet that was later named after him.

I don't know when 97 percent of economists agreed on anything, let alone market conditions. And I certainly can't remember a time when economists were all in agreement that a crash was coming.

They tend to be shills for market makers and Wall Street interests who profit off of bull markets. The same interests then profit from the downfall that investors never see coming because, economists fail to identify said downfalls when they occur. </TEXT>

They're glorified historians. And I don't mean to insult historians, at least they're honest about the fact their work deals with more the past than the present. </TEXT>
