<TEXT> Not sure why you got downvoted, I agree here. Anderz had no clue, Nebris knew Pak had the Notch apple. They had a plan, a strategy. Anderz decided to just fill Nebris with arrows, not knowing about the insane regeneration and resistance. Nebris was able to lure Pakratt out of his comfort zone, eat the apple, run away to let the regeneration run off and then attack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right, three productive days later we have done quite a lot. My friend has completely automated Galgadorian Metal and the enhanced and enhanced infused variants. We can now request them in the AE from scratch. Pretty impressive. I've mainly been working on a couple mining drones and while I've been close, I can't get them to perfectly do what I want (main problems now are charging (they're far out), coming home when finished etc) but I do have drone couples (one mines, one picks up) that scratch the surface of an area for meteor blocks using a Fortune III Efficiency IV diamond hammer and send the drops to our base. All I need to do is to redefine an area every now and then. If people are interested, I'm willing to share the programs how they are right now. Also slowly started working on Galacticraft stuff, but it's all very grindy and resource-intensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually nothing that's very interesting, but [this](https://i.imgur.com/kvWUyJ5.png) is our ~~base~~ mess on Blast Off at the moment. We've reached the point where we can make Galgadorian metal so we finally have a couple Ender IO machines. Botania Alfheim portal is up, autocrafting of 64k ME drives is a fact but that's it mainly. Cleaned up last night, replaced our clay floor with grass, automated wood and charcoal farm with Steve's carts, automated sugar cane farm using Pneumaticraft drones.. We have a wither skeleton farm a couple thousand blocks out and a mob farm up in the air (so not shown here), base on the left is another player's base. For us, it's now time to finally build and prepare for the hard work! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, I have a few questions about this spreadsheet.

1. In the list of the (optional) general modifiers, it says I need a glowstone nugget. Doesn't that have to be a golden nugget?
2. What are the "block effect" and "entity effect" that you mean for the nether brick and brick (normal brick or stone brick?) modifier?
3. In the effect modifiers, for power, is it a glowstone block or glowstone dust? </TEXT>

You can also put a laundry basket in your room for your clothes. If all this goes well, add something extra next week, like keeping either a desk or a part of your floor empty. I have started doing this a week ago, and my room is getting cleaner slowly but surely. Just build it up, step by step. </TEXT>

I recommend updating Botania to fix your first two problems and reporting the other two issues to Vazkii's github page. </TEXT>

Dat laatste klopt als een bus. Dat is de reden waarom ik niet direct weer aan een stage ben begonnen, maar rustig de tijd neem om iets te vinden wat bij me past voor over een aantal maanden. Wat betreft je andere reactie, nah het is goed voor nu. Ik denk dat ik zo toch nog even ga proberen wat slaap te vatten.

<TEXT> Ik zit in een vergelijkbare situatie. Ik kom erg lastig uit bed/op gang en zorg zelfs slecht voor mezelf. Mijn gedachten nemen geregeld de vrije loop met me, uiteraard de verkeerde richting in, vooral als ik mij eenzaam voel en 's avonds laat. Mijn dag/nacht ritme is bijna omgedraaid naar een nacht/dag ritme. Ik ben al een paar maanden de moed aan het verzamelen om naar mn huisarts te stappen en naar een psycholoog te vragen omdat ik weet dat dat waarschijnlijk het beste voor me is. Je bent niks verplicht, maar ik zou er wel over nadenken. Sterkte ermee, en als je ooit wilt praten, kun je me een bericht sturen.

<TEXT> This is what probably happened to me and my family years ago. I was young and woke up in the middle of the night because of a flickering orange light through my curtains. Turns out our hedge was on fire and the fire was about to spread onto the houses. (Block of 8 connnected, we're the third from the left) I woke up my parents who woke up my sister, all of our neighbours and called the emergency line. They could not find the cause of the fire, it must have been a cigarette from our neighbour as he's a smoker. I possibly saved multiple lives that night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, I am part of a small community called Indeed (www.indeedcommunity.com) and we host AS2. We are a mature community, generally 21+ years old and we are a very close group due to the use of a big Skype group that is integrated with IRC, so in-game chat and people on skype can also talk to each other directly.

At the moment we have two servers running with 8 islands each and I have one slot left. If you are still looking for a place to play AS2, feel free to check out our website and fill in an application on the forums. I am happy to help you out from there :) </TEXT>

There's a modlist in the comments. It's a pack designed for low-end computers, I can run it fine on my laptop. I can't access dynmap from where I am now, why isn't it useful? Server is probably empty at the moment, everyone's at work. I agree on the games tab though, haha. We mostly use the forums and Skype to communicate.

<TEXT> Yeah I thought so. Witchery is such a big mod, it's got way more than I expected. There are so many things you can easily miss the first time you play it. I think I might do some lycantropy later, I first wanna get the witchcraft stuff going.

If you ever want to join a server, I can recommend you check out the Indeed community (www.indeedcommunity.com). Ever since I've joined, I've been having fun and made a lot of friends there. We have just opened for applications again. </TEXT>

Yeah it'll have to be a big maze, but I can just design it in creative I think. Should be fun to push a few test subjects.. uuh server members into it. It's a long-term project but I'm known for not finishing long-term projects. I'll see how things will go.

Good to know the others can just go kill stuff. :) Will have a talk with the group to see who's in for some fun hehe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Will do, yeah! I've been reading a little about the Spirit World on the wiki here and there. You spawn there with an empty inventory right? Are there any items you can take with you? What about your armor?

I might build a maze of Ender-Bramble's (had to look them up but sounds cool) as a community thing, don't know. Depends on how easily they can be mass-produced as they're not too expensive.

So far I know just one person who has started witchery, but he has been inactive for a while. I might poke him and some others to do that ritual. Sounds like a lot of fun. Thanks for your reply! </TEXT>

Second hill will be for magic mods (Witchery for now, but I'm gonna add Blood Magic and Thaumcraft, maybe Botania) and third one is for miscellaneous. Maybe bees, but mesa biomes suck for bees :P So its not a dry moat, I wanna keep the river. I get back and forth between the hills using travel anchors and a staff of traveling at the moment, but I wanna get rid of these sometime. Not sure yet. If I remember tonight, I can make some screenshots of the area and show you what I mean :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Witchery] What to do next? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone. Just a quick note here, English is not my first language so there might be a few weird sentences in here. :P

I have started doing some witchery stuff on the server I play on last week. I now have an altar going with ~9k power (x5) because I did the ritual that grows all the trees and plants etc around your circles. I did some basic distilling, brewing and cauldron stuff. It's all nice and fun but I don't know where to go from here! There are 8 books in-game with things you can do and I don't know what's up next for me. Who can suggest me fun, handy, awesome things that I can do with this mod?!

I also got the noble task from one of the server moderators to set up a witchery quest line for our quest book. We have one now, but it doesn't go very deep into the mod. Any ideas are welcome! :) I think Witchery holds a lot of great stuff, I just don't know where. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here in the Netherlands we have something for on your bread. It's a paste from [speculoos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculoos), it's really sweet. I once thought my mum gave me a peanut butter sandwich, but it was a speculoos paste one. Not really painful, but it was very, very weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really needed to get home from work a couple weeks ago. It was 11pm and the bus stop is shared with the local football stadium. Local football team had won the game with 6-1 that night so the bus was full of drunk men. One of them sat on me, claimed he had not seen me while his hands went into my coat. He was so heavy, I couldn't really do anything. One of the few sober people on that bus pulled him off me as soon as he saw what was actually going on. </TEXT>

I woke up my parents and sister. While my dad called the emergency line, my mum and I woke our neighbors. A couple lives have been saved that night, I don't know what would've happened if I did not wake up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can also craft the drop of luck. That's what I've been doing. If you open the blue witchery book about the cauldron's recipes (Witches Brews) and hover over the ingredients for drop of luck, you'll see how much power you need for some of them. I don't know the total amount of power by heart but it's quite a lot so I skipped the cauldron recipe for drop of luck.. On our server, the crafting recipe in a normal workbench worked as well. Maybe try that :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If one magic mod has in-game documentation, it has to be Witchery. There are now about 8 or 9 books. The mod adds a lot of small things that are fun or nifty, so you might lose yourself in all the possibilities. I know I don't have a goal yet to work towards, not sure what I wanna do first out of these 8-9 topics and what's considered end-game. I do know it's an awesome mod :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be really honest, I think it would be amazing if newcomers can just sneak into the portal while the other teams are still fighting out there. Also Chad should make a brand new bow and let someone combine bows with the rubbish one he has now..

Crazy episode this was. Lot of circling around each other and following each other into and out it the nether, all going from that one portal back to 0,0.. Damn! Can't wait til Monday! </TEXT>

I don't think he's getting burnt out or bored, he seems to still enjoy the game. It's just loss of focus after recording multiple episodes in a row.

<TEXT> I started my graduation internship this week and I think I couldn't have started it worse than I did. On Monday, we got snow and I got stuck in public transport. After 1.5 hours of standing still in a train in the middle of nowhere, the damn train turned around and I had to travel along by bus. I got in 2 hours late on my first day.. Tuesday was fine. Wednesday I've spent the day at home in bed being sick. Thursday I felt better so I went back there, they told me to go back home to get better. And today I spent my time at home too, trying to get better. I still feel rubbish and I called off for work in the weekend. Bye money.. :P Hope I'm no longer tired and cold on Monday so I can get a new fresh start! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make a deconstruction table. This breaks down items to their primal aspects and there is a chance of getting a research aspect each time. I recommend using wool or crafting tables, you'll see why.

Another thing you can do is to place bookshelves around your research table. This gives aspects in your research table a shiny thingy, which means you have one extra. So this does not generate infinite research points but it is really helpful. It gets back after some time and is useful if you're one short for completing a research in the table. :) </TEXT>

You mean the desert village Seth and MC visit too? I thought I could see a tiny nameplate in the distance in Seth's video but I didn't hear anyone. Will watch again and maybe edit for timestamp.. Also will watch Doc now. Brb.

edit: turned out to be MC's nametag. I somehow missed the part where they both took a turn in their staircase so they would dig parallel and not go out of Mumble range. [Here's](http://youtu.be/pdjH7Nba3-I?t=16m7s) a timestamp for anyone who's still interested, Seth looks at it two times but I'm pretty sure it's MC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't ask me, I don't know. I believe they pick the color of your name based on the color of the UHC team that person is in. For example Nebris is in the pink/red/purple team and all users with the Nebris flair have a pink name. </TEXT>

I can't watch his livestreams because he streams at 3AM for me. Even if I listen/watch them later, I use them as some sort of podcast, it's in the background while I'm studying and I just listen to what he's gotta say and his music. And I really like the music, I just don't have the time to search through his streams for his music. Anyone can help me out here? Or does Chad have a website where he lists the music [just like sevadus does?](https://www.sevadus.tv/music.php) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I missed a few of these. Not because I was late but just because I have been way too busy the past few weeks. But hiiii! I probably failed my exam and I also handed in something that wasn't even looking like a scientific article.. I probably didn't pass the big course from the past two months :(

In other news, I have to write another article but this can be about anything as long as it's related to biology. Preferably something cool and easy to understand for everyone because this writing course is about writing to a larger public. For example news articles or news reports or interviews. I can't find a nice article :( I was maybe looking for something or someone important in the history of biology and trying to make a report about it because it is its anniversary but I can't really find anything. For example, Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was published 155 years ago in 10 days, but yeah.. I don't like the number 155 there. If it were 150, sure! Something like that, maybe someone has an idea? :) </TEXT>

I guess we'll see what will happen :) PVP was fun, they just did the PVP event after which Sethbling moved out the border to a million blocks diameter, but I thought we were all talking about the vanilla server. There has been enough minecraft lately. Four Mindcrackers were playing Crash Landing, there were three duos playing Diversity maps (plus B-team a few episodes), there was Survival of the Fittest, there was Color of Infinity... PVP maps are fun, absolutely, but I thought we were talking about the "dead" vanilla server. I see this as two separate things. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just noticed this and I don't really know if it's intended or not, but it bothers me :P I just searched for a post from last week which contained a suggestion, so I used the link flair search option on the reddit here. When you click on Suggestion, it will also show you all Survival of the Fittest posts. Is it possible to change this? My guess is that it has something to do with the pink color of both flairs, it's exactly the same. If not, ignore this, I guess ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There has been a similar post but I can't seem to find it. Maybe it got deleted already, but that person had a similar idea. He said the server should be online one day per week, which I highly disagree with. Now the difference between your and his post is that you're not taking down the server for the rest of the week (and maybe pick a daily time?) but yeah. I don't think you can "force" them to get online at a certain moment. It would disturb their recording schedules, also for other series, because they are all busy with a lot of things besides vanilla server. If the guys (and girl) feel like it, they should definitely play on the server, not when we want them to.

edit: [found it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/2lgznw/suggestiontake_the_mindcrack_server_offline_for_6/) OP didn't add the Suggestion link flair. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, sorry. I tried considering it but all I can see is problems for the Mindcrackers with scheduling. Not even for Mindcrack vanilla, but also other series, especially when they pick another day every week. God knows when they record group events like Gmod, MK8 and Speedrunners. This might mess up their complete planning. You're talking about 30 people that you wanna have on the server around the same time. It's not even possible for them to be all 30 in a UHC.

Besides the recording, there's the obligatory part in it because they "have to play at that moment". If they don't, it's another whole week without vanilla content. We already barely have any content, let's not take away the time for them to finally record something. Why can't people just be patient for a Mindcracker to publish a certain episode for a series? All we want is more, more, more but the Mindcrackers are also human beings with a social life and choices and wishes. If someone doesn't feel like recording a bit of vanilla content, I'd rather have them wait until they feel like it than record it anyway with a sad face and sad voice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No you were not. I was really excited and cheering out loud when he revealed his face. I have had several theories in the past week, including Chad. It had to be a newcomer. Although it would have been a huge prank like Generik wanted to do sometime, I had never believed he would've managed to. I thought for a while that it might be the person that donated the highest amount of money during the marathon, but this went on for the whole week and this would never be possible in 24hrs. BTC was also an option but he was way too busy, he started a few new series lately. It had to be a newcomer and Chad has made the switch to YouTube with gmod, Mario kart, diversity etc etc. I am really happy for him :D </TEXT>

I am really curious as for who took away the thing Anderz put near the door! (Forgot the name) Because it was gone. That was probably what he heard instead of what he thought was the bear trap. Speedy was miles away according to the maps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the major drop after the first episode might be because the server restart was just as hyped about as with UHCs. Everyone was excited for the new season and when it turned out they would be using a world border, there were more people than just those few Mindcrackers who disagreed with it. I guess they stopped watching immediately.

edit: whoops I don't know why I already submitted. Secondly, the server reset was during the holidays. On the one hand, no one is going to college so everyone has time to watch, but on the other hand, people are leaving town for multiple weeks, etcetera. I've been away for only a week, I went to Dublin, but I missed a week's content and I never managed to catch up. I felt like I should because I didn't wanna miss anything in that early stage of the new server, but I never did.. That might be the reason why I stopped watching (I only watch one when I'm really bored, I should definitely watch more often) and maybe this is the same for others..

And now people are back in college, having less time to watch. All I hope is that it's not the end of that server already. There are still people active but they upload a Mindcrack video each two days. I expect videos from at least Bdubs and Doc today, possibly Anderz and Vechs as well :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think tricking someone with someone else's wool is just smart. It makes people think about whether or not they should trust them, especially when that person just killed someone else. They should realize that they have multiple colors of wool on them, or they should first show a color or something like that. Or there should be some sort of a plugin that removes additional wool from someone's inventory, to prevent this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, of course a head would be better (as in cheaper) than 2 apples. I also understand it leads to a bit more PVP in order to obtain a head, which I don't think is really necessary, there's already enough PVP. Things don't have to go quicker. I'd rather see a team getting all geared up (iron/diamond armor, diamond sword, bow, maybe potions) than rushing into battle without being fully geared.

Maybe I wasn't clear enough. The heads are a good solution if you get low on health really quickly, like in a fight or just bad luck (like Sevadus this last season, lot of mobs around him), don't get me wrong there, but I don't think you really need it if you're well prepared or at almost full health. Which counts for almost everyone most of the time. Besides this, the golden apple works fine anyway. It's just the kill that adds another way of regenerating health, making it easier to do so. Especially near the end of a season, when there's more PVP and there's a few people left, wandering around with gear from a few other teams, it would only stretch out the last bits. They're all at full health again, very easily, and it's just "a normal PVP battle", nothing exciting to it because someone's not at full health anymore. I think it takes away a little bit of the challenge in UHC to regenerate health and to show the difference in skill. That's how I see it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually think that's too much.. That's almost half of your total health, would make it way too easy. I assume players would drop their heads? That means that with one apple, a bit of gold and a kill, you'd be able to get quite a lot of health back. I don't like it. It's also pointless to use one when you're not even four hearts down. That's how I see it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [ME3] Two questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-24 10:08:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started Material Energy^3 a few days ago and I really like it. However, I have two questions.

1. I updated yesterday from 1.4.1 to 1.4.4. This update contained a lot of new quests, but I can't seem to complete them. For example the clay quest in the first chapter. I scanned the whole pond for clay, even dug under all the sand, dirt and gravel, but I couldn't find any more than 32 clay while I need 100. Also, the next quest says there's some sort of AE room under the clay. This was all dirt and stuff for me. Is there a way to "update" the spatial areas so I can complete the quests instead of /hqm edit them? I just finished the first chapter of the quest book before I updated so I'm not that far ahead in the game. If it's necessary, a restart wouldn't be a big problem, but I'd prefer not to.

2. This question is somewhat stupid maybe, but I feel like I'm missing a lot of loot and Easter Eggs on this map. Am I supposed to literally investigate every single area? Break through walls and floors etcetera? I accidentally broke a few blocks yesterday and there was a chest, so I guess there's a lot more of these chests hidden around each spatial area.. Am I supposed to just tear everything apart? Or is there a logical way to reach these chests? </TEXT>

It's funny how you can fill your whole minecraft day with harvesting all your crops or shear all your sheep. However I am looking for some fun or odd goals to complete. For example, obtain a stack of poisonous potatoes. I have 7 already :D Anyone have more of these fun goals to do besides the things I'm already working on? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suggestions for an adventure-based modpack </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-20 17:56:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Me and some friends are starting a new server soon and like previous times, we wanna build a custom modpack. This time we're less focused on tech mods and more focused on magic mods like Thaumcraft, Blood Magic, Ars Magica and Witchery. We're also looking for a bit of a challenge, or rather adventure, so we'll probably add some dungeon mods and a few mods that add more (difficulty to) mobs.

Our question now is if anyone knows of any mods that are more tier-based. Most of the tech mods around these days make Minecraft a lot easier and once you've set up a few machines, you're already good to go. We don't want this anymore.

Also, we're looking for a mod that adds maybe a few food items. Not as much as Pam's Harvestcraft. Does anyone have any suggestions for this?


Edit: I forgot to mention we're trying to build a 1.7.10 modpack

Thanks a bunch. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 1.7.10 seed: great survival island + 2 ocean temples nearby! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-25 20:29:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seed: 2735126617611667291

You spawn on [an island](http://gyazo.com/e96824ac3f3a3576edc18927d2da12dd) with a small patch of grass. In the distance (I have render distance at maximum though) you see [another island](http://gyazo.com/7a036c84ae96b9a6288709bf4d7bebef) with a few oak trees on it. It's just over 200 blocks to the south. Furthermore, there are two ocean temples nearby. One is close to the spawn island at X -300, Z +170. The other is close to the second island at X -470 and Z +615.

I think this can serve as a great survival map. You start with some trees and your island. You can cave down (be careful with the water) and you might spot more bits of land on your way. I have not seen a single bit of continent, only very small islands. There might also be more ocean dungeons, I don't know. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [AS] Lost all TC4 research points after updating from 2.1.9 to 3.0.1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-18 11:14:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title says it all. Research table is empty but I can't scan items to get my research points back because my Thaumometer says I already scanned it! I had a lot of aspects for all of them. I went crazy scanning everything on my items, even everything in my chests and ME network. I don't have anything to scan for new research points.

I am telling this because I'm curious if I'm the only one, and if someone knows what could have caused this to happen. Thaumcraft is not updated between AS 2.1.9 and AS 3.0.1. For now I gave myself 400 of each primal aspect but if this happens to more people, I think someone should look into it. I have never seen this before. I know I can go and find tons of nodes for a good amount of primal aspects and combine my way back up again, but that's not what I want. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [AS] Steady supply of sulfur? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-17 10:37:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have no idea how I can get myself some sulfur very easily. I know there's a Nether ore but I have no intentions to enter the Nether at all. I don't have the resources and power to set up the laser drill (planning to do so, gonna set up an animal farm with a slaughterhouse anywhere these days) so yeah, no Nether ores for me now. I've been pulverizing a lot of coal which has a 10% chance of sulfur but I'm getting low on coal and I got pulverized coal everywhere.

Is it worth it to set up a blaze farm in the meantime and then pulverize some of the blaze rods every now and then? I really need the sulfur for yellorium dust for my big reactor. I managed to get enough stuff to finish the reactor but I can barely fill it with yellorium... As soon as I can, I'm also one step closer to the laser drill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am playing the Ag Skies map like many of us and I set up my MFR soy bean farm yesterday. It's quite big because I can replace a lot of ingredients in the Hell's Kitchen quests with tofu or soy milk etcetera. Just wanna keep this running.

I've run into one minor problem though. Or not even a problem, but it's getting annoying. The farm is 100% soy beans but every now and then there are asparagus seeds lying around on the floor around the farm. It's free asparagus seeds, but where are they coming from? Does it have something to do with the ore dictionary? It's only asparagus seeds, very strange... </TEXT>
