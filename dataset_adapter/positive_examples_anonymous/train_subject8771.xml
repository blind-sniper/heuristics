<TEXT> One of the reasons juicing hasn't worked for you in the past is because it's not a balanced diet and not sustainable. You have to ease into weight loss and it sounds like you just stopped everything and started juicing. That is a shock to your body. Creating a healthy balanced diet is the only proven way to lose weight in the long term. Also, it helps to have one cheat food. For me it's dark chocolate and I give myself an ounce a day. It significantly cuts down the cravings.  Good luck with everything.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I quit swimming my freshman year of HS (it's been 5 years), but recently I've been wanting to get back in shape. I was a decent swimmer when I was competitive, so it hasn't taken too long for me to get back to where I was. I got in the pool 4 weeks ago, and I've been swimming 4 times/week and today I swam 2200 yards (in sets), and timed a 30sec 50 (without a start). Feels good man!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like the most likely outcome in this season is that Korra loses her bending. i know nobody wants that to happen, but I think if this happens she will be able to get more in touch with her spiritual side. I think it was mentioned in a post somewhere that [Amon closes a chakra in order to prevent a person from bending](/spoiler). If Korra is able to get in touch with her spiritual side, she could unlock it and then kick his butt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to agree with you. I think this is the case because we followed Zuko's progression as much as Aang's, but 1)Zuko went through more change personally which made him more appealing towards the end, maybe? 2) We all knew Aang would fight the Firelord; that was never a doubt. However, Zuko's fight with Azula was more uncertain throughout the series since Zuko's loyalties were in question all the time. So, it was more surprising I think when it came right down to it when it was time to fight her (not to mention satisfying to see her get her ass beat - the crazy bitch...). 3) Last thing is the personal aspect. They were brother and sister. They knew each other and had a connection through their shared past (twisted yes), but Aang and Ozai were not personally invested in their fight (yes, Aang probably was, but Ozai definitely was not).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it is well established that Korra has negative traits thus far. I read some interviews with the creators and they said that Korra was made to be quite flawed. Obviously this will lead to some serious character development. But to answer your question I think her positive qualities are determination and passion for the safety of her friends and the preservation of bending, and her best friend is her polarbear dog..that's gotta count for something, right? While she may be going about things the wrong way right now (three episodes in), I think she has good intentions and will find the right path.  </TEXT>

However, what I dislike about him is that he acts like a leech. He doesn't act independently and needs Morgana to tell him what to do to get his own revenge. If he was a real villain, he would act on his own accord and not on someone else's.

<TEXT> My mom died when I was 14 years old. She was an alcoholic and prescription drug addict. And I'm sure everyone has heard "Your Mama" jokes. I realized early on that my tragedy was not going to change what people say and that they won't understand what it's like to have a dead mother. All the time people say "Your Mama" jokes and even my friends sometimes forget that my mom died and they will say them to my face. What helps me is to realize that people are stupid and they won't change. When they do say the joke to my face, I wait until they are done and then, with a smile on my face, I remind them that I don't have a mother. Almost every time the person will feel guilty and say sorry and the jokes are over for the day. I don't have a problem with the jokes, I just feel like the honesty will remind them in the future to be more aware of their audience and I think it works. It's worth a try in your case. It's kind of like seeing the funny side and saying something at the same time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I can say from experience that the mother probably has had a huge influence in how your daughter feels. I lived with my mom for most of my life. My mom hated my dad too and I grew up thinking I should hate him. I learned later that a lot of things my mom said to me were only half-truths. I don't know the whole story with you, but the mom could have something to do with it and your daughter is a teenager now. You rarely see her, so she can easily use you as a target for her anger. Teens are nasty sometimes.
Is there anyway you could collaborate with your daughter's mother to work something out? It seems like you aren't on good terms with her, but in the interest of your daughter, maybe something can be worked out.  </TEXT>
