<TEXT> Holy shit man. There are some things that people shouldn't ever have to see, sorry you ever had to see that. 


Not gonna lie, thought you bailed on us (not that I blamed you, there was some serious reddit-mobage going on). All I gotta say is thanks, for both the perseverance and the foresight to preview the tapes instead of showing live like most wanted, and for coming back to explain as much as you could anyway, even though i'm sure it's probably something you'd rather hand off to the cops and bleach from your brain. 


Take care of yourself. This is the sort of shit that makes people crazy. And as far as all the downvoting goes, don't let it get to you. People sometimes tend to mix up "Imaginary sorting system" with "Cocaine laced with gold". 


Thanks again OP, you did good :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked as a swimmers aid, both the lifeguards had a thing for either my mom or me (so I guess i've technically had two). The older guy (about two hundred pounds of "doughy" skin (his words, not mine)), once invited my mom to come "put on her little bikini" and join him at open swim. 


The other lifeguard would either hit on me and ask if I wanted to leave and go bar hopping with him, or (later) ask for pics of my older sister. 

I was in middle school. He was 19. 


Yeah.

Edit; forgot to mention, when my dad was deployed to Iraq, the older guy (doughy) decided it would be a good time to tell me his stories about 'nam, and how he witnessed one guy get torn to bits by a crashing helicopter. Apparently it started raining chunks of flesh. My dad flew helicopters .-. </TEXT>

Damn. Here's a happy one for ya. I work in an animal shelter, this morning I saw an older lady be reunited with her lost dog. The dog practically flew to the lady in our waiting area, even though the dog herself was like a hundred years old. Many slobbery dog kisses were given. It was pretty awesome, the lady started sobbing. She didn't think she would see her dog again (which is why microchips are always a good thing!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. I don't think your son would want you to feel this way, nor feel so terrible as to lead you to end your life early. 


Fight for him. Live your life with passion, and twice as much brilliance for him. Do everything you think he would have liked to do as an adult. Lead a life so incredible so that, when it is your natural time, and you are reunited, you have a thousand stories to tell him. None of which will be new to him, because no doubt he'll be beside you the whole time.


I'm sure he would still love to hear them though.


So build that life. Start traveling. Find a passion. Experiment. Live loudly, even if it feels wrong and alien. You'll find your rhythm eventually. Before you know it, you'll be making your son proud.  </TEXT>

You are not weak. You are strong. You are fighting this. You've thought about suicide, and you've rejected it. You are brave, and you will beat this. You have to want to pull yourself out of this, you have to start thinking up. Start smiling, even if you aren't happy (you'll trick your brain into releasing happy hormones :D) YOU ARE WORTHY! You are human, and you were born here. You've got just as much of a right to life and happiness as everyone else. You are a strong human being. you are worth it  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. You are a teenager; by definition you are going to make mistakes. Right now, things seem pretty terrible. It sucks. You feel worthless and shitty, and like nothing is worth it.


But it is. Because your life hasn't even begun yet :] you have to keep trudging on, keep pushing yourself a little bit every day. Make it a goal to accept your mistakes and learn from them. In a little while you'll find the strength to do things you didn't realize you were capable of; maybe even ask out that girl. And I bet you'll be even more super careful now  driving after you made that mistake; that extra caution may end up saving your life one day. Then you might actually be thankful o
For cracking that bumper (kinda ridiculous how life works that way, huh?)

So keep that in mind every time you feel sucky, or down. Being a teenager is basically having depression, anxiety, and a bit of OCD all wrapped up in one several-year long party; feeling horrible is going to happen. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Just don't wait for it to come to you, now is the time to start working for it. You can get past this :] </TEXT>

Perhaps it might be good to go talk to one, but specify you're looking to deal with the underlying issues and root of the problem, as opposed to copping mechanisms.

<TEXT> Do you think part of your problem is you have a lot of anxiety? That can definitely lead to eating disorders, when it becomes less about image an more about control. Your husband may be trying to help you actually, in his own way. When someone threatens to hurt them self, a gut response for many people is to say something like "but what about your family? Or me? You'll hurt me!" It's almost like they want to guilt them into getting better. This definitely doesn't work for everyone, and can do a lot of harm, but that could be why your husband says those things. He may see you hurting, and  is feeling helpless and desperate. 


Don't worry about how you "should" feel, life  doesn't always turn out the way we plan :] if you don't feel good, recognize that. Nothing is wrong with you, you are not alone. Plenty of people who are "supposed" to be happy are actually very sad.  The silver lining to that is you have a huge support group of people in similar positions, all ready to help you :] </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. Your ex sounds troubled, and it sounds like she still is troubling you. Maybe not her in particular, but more so her rejection. Your nightmares about being beaten up sound a lot like some of mine; I used to have breakdowns before school because I was afraid of disappointing my teachers. I dealt with this by totally shutting down emotionally; sounds like you've taken the same route. 


You are human. You have been hurt. There was no damn reason for you to get hurt, but you got swiped up in what sounds like someone else's flood. You are strong. You will survive this. Don't push yourself to meet new women, that will come in time. You can't force that sort of thing.


I'm scared too, of rejection, and being too weak. Let's be scared together. You can get through this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look. Buddy. I get it. Some monks up on a mountain top yelled out some crazy chants and now you're supposed to save us from the dragons. It's your destiny. But let me tell you a little secret; i've always known I would be a shop keeper. It was decided when I was very young I would run the village shop. You could say that's *my* destiny. 


Now, just because I knew my destiny, does that mean I was given all I needed scotch-free? Hell no. I had to work for it. No one taught me how to manage books, or keep inventory. I had to learn, work hard, and it's the time I spent working that made me into a great shop keeper; not the so-called "destiny" I was given. 


So listen here, buddy. I don't doubt you could be the hero. But me giving you these weapons for free? That's only gonna hurt you in the long run. The monks ain't gonna make you a hero; only you can do that through building yourself into the best possible warrior you can be. By working hard, and training. I get it, I get it. I may seem like a jerk, after all what kind of impact will having to work for four gold coins make? Well, not having to work will make you lazy. Let me tell you friend, it's a slippery slope. Soon it's four coins, then it's walking around enemies and cheating your way through dungeons, and suddenly you find yourself in front of a dragon trying to *cheat* your way out. 

So trust me, when you take the time to earn the money for this here broadsword, you aren't just buying a broadsword. You're buying character. </TEXT>
