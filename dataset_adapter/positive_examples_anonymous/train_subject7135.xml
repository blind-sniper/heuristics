<TEXT> I guess a lot of it comes down to the belief that many of  these guys have that women care less about looks, and that all you need is a good personality to get a relationship.

Which is fallacious, of course, because women are as shallow as men and the good-looking girl these guys are expecting to woo through personality alone won't come but neither will the bad-looking girl.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beauty is subjective to a point. It's been well-documented that all cultures believe facial symmetry=beauty.

You have no idea what my personality is. You're arguing at me through the perception that I fit into the 'niceguy' category; I don't because I don't blame women for my problems as I don't blame myself. It just is the way it is.

You can tell who's a FA type right off the bat and usually you nope out before they get clingy/obsessive or downright nasty.

That's what you tell yourself, then? It's more likely that you mark those you deem unattractive as FA/trp/neckbeards/niceguys and then make excuses for the character flaws of better looking men.

You're arguing from the assumption that you and other people in relationships have 'good' personalities, which is utter bullshit. The fact of the matter is that people make concessions for the flaws they find in attractive people over the flaws they find in unattractive people.

Don't fool yourself. No one gives a shit about your 'personality'; they like you because you fit into a range of attractiveness determined by society. You really think you'd be such a 'good' person if you looked as I do?  </TEXT>

So you're agreeing with me, then? That women treat me the way they do because of how I look? 

I don't lash out at women, anyway. I 'lash out' at malicious hypocrites like yourself that damn ugly men for feeling down about their lack of success with women, and force feed them these lies about personality. 

You're shallow, I'm shallow, everybody's shallow. Personality means little compared to physicality.

 Get over it and be thankful that you weren't born ugly. I'd be thankful if I hadn't been born at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although I can't give examples of everyday racists in relationships, besides the casual racism of one of my friends, Mel Gibson, John Mayer, Donald Stirling ( now *he* is a good argument against the myth of personalitymoney/looks) are all notable racists who have been in many relationships, I'd assume.

This sub is for making fun of pitiful "nice guys' that think being the bare minimum for a human being entitles them to sex / reciprocated affection, and who are actually not very nice at all.

No, shithead, I was criticizing some dickhead who had called a black woman a monkey because she'd attacked a white woman. Did you even read my comments on that matter? Besides, what does it matter whether I'm racist or not? Many racists are in relationships.

You're a fool if you think ugly guys can 'overcome' their ugliness by having a stunning personality. Would you date an ugly man? Look at the sub that you're in. The entire purpose of this cystic place is to make fun of unattractive people, with the excuse that it's their 'personalities' that is the problem.

I suggest you take a look at yourself and be thankful that you received validation to uphold such delusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whatever,man. 

You know full well why you're being upvoted, and why you used that term in relation to a topic unnecessarily turned into something about race. 

The title says, 'black women...white lady', it's been framed in the topic of race, therefore obviously changing the connotation of your comment. 

'People are monkeys', you didn't say-- you said 'Monkeys are going to be monkeys' with a clear underlying tone of who in the video you deemed to be the monkey. Or are you saying you weren't defending the girl who'd been attacked, and calling her a monkey instead for no reason? The people upvoting you know this as well, but believe that because you aren't yelling, " I hate blacks," you're not being overtly racist and they can silently confirm their own latent racist beliefs. 

 You're the racist that assumes a monkey has to be black, 

This isn't high school, you invalid. Twisting your connotations won't work on people with an inkling of common sense. Keep your poorly-hidden racism to yourself. 

You're pathetic. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-05 03:05:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently started with online dating and after setting up my profile, began to send off a bombardment of messages.

A couple of girls replied, one negatively ( I asked her if she liked A Serbian Film because she was Serbian) and one relatively positively. It turned out that the girl who responded favourably was into a lot of the things I liked as well. 

I figured it wouldn't hurt asking for her number, not expecting anything, and she agreed. We moved to text and I asked whether she wanted to hang out sometime in the week, to which she replied that she was busy but would let me know if she was free.

I'm not really used to interacting with women like this, so I'm wondering if it's a bad sign that she said she'd let me know instead of just straight up saying yes or no. I also don't know whether I should wait or whether I should contact her again to see what she says.

What do you guys think?

Edit: Texted her and she didn't reply. GG, I guess. </TEXT>

He'd move really quick, and kind of shimmered as if he was made of static as he advanced in quick spasmodic leaps towards me. I'd run, but I could never get away because time would slow, and no matter how many times I screamed for my mum, she wouldn't come.

Fun fact: Years later the jackal returned in my bouts of sleep paralysis. One time I felt him grab my shirt, and as I grabbed his arm, I could feel my hand going numb. Fuck sleep paralysis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That'd be a strawman argument if I was attacking you on the basis of you being a shill, which I'm not seeing as I honestly couldn't really give a shit if you are or not. I was wrong in thinking you were a shill, but that doesn't mean there aren't people working for whatever government to influence online discussion.

A conspiracy theorist believes something that has no to very little concrete proof backing it up. My comment isn't [baseless](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/14/gchq-tools-manipulate-online-information-leak), mate.

Hell, I'll even link you the document leaked by Ol' Mate Snowden himself:[here](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/)

If you read my post history, you'll see that I don't go around denouncing others as shills. I just thought it was kind of humorous that the exact same comment had been posted by two different accounts, one of them being only a few hours old.

Trim that inferiority complex of yours a bit, mate, I mistakenly thought you were some guy in a naval base or whatever, it's no big deal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus Christ, you're angry.

Over what? A fuckwit comment that you made to try and justify some kind of contrarian, holier-than-thou bullshit. Am I assaulting your integrity or something? 

It's not a conspiracy that governments employ people to sway discussion on particular topics here; I mean, one look at a thread on Russia/Ukraine should give you an insight into how common these kinds of commentators are. I just saw two of the same comments and though, "Weird. Probably some shills or something."

And for the record, and against the titanic strawman argument you've made, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm not a 9/11 "truther", nor do I believe in the Illuminati, lizard-people, etc. 

Also, why the fuck are you defending so vehemently such a useless comment? What does your self-righteous wankjob of a comment even bring to the discussion other than 'hurr durr... dat other subreddit is silly'?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If you truly believe "I know that if I dated an equally ugly girl, I'd be just as miserable as if I stayed alone..." then you are both and obviously have no interest in a relationship that contains more than sex 

See, I always see this shit. People go on and on about how terrible it is that I'm not attracted to an ugly girl, but they never date them themselves. It's not like I think I deserve some supermodel; I just know that anyone that I could potentially date would not be attracted to me and vice-versa. 

Why do you insist on patronising people like me by holding them to different standards to your own? I bet you don't  go around dating physically unattractive people, do you? When was the last time you dated a friend who was ugly? Or just some random ugly person.

So, what are you going to do? Continue on blindly in the hopes that a girl may pity you enough? You going to continue with such uncertainty until you're thirty? Forty? What if you never achieve any relationship? It's common for people such as us to end up that way, at the tail end of thirty wondering when we'll ever get our chance.

Believe me, mate, if they'd have wanted people like us, then we wouldn't be in this situation. I choose not to believe their bullshit about personality mattering. They pick the cream of the crop and then convince the rest that it's our 'personality' that is fucked up, not the fact that we were fucked from the beginning.

But go ahead, continue on looking in the off chance you get a relationship. Hell, I'll even congratulate you if you do get one. But there's no way in hell I'm living to thirty on the slim chance that I might find someone. </TEXT>

Look at the sub linked in this thread, look at all the posts of men/women who have done just that, stuck by people in friendships and then when they've wanted to become intimate, have been kept on the friend path.

I mean,for fuck's sake, the very reason your sub exists is to make fun of those men who lament over the fact that they have taken this exact path of friendship and failed.

I mean, you'll constantly live in a weird sort of limbo where you'll want intimacy but never receive it, but you should be happy with that because women don't owe you intimacy but they sure owe intimacy to these other physically attractive guys they just met." 

That's what all those sexually successful guys do, yeah? Makes friends with women first? 

In 30 years, everyone is going to be much less attractive. What do you do then? 

So I wait until someone has had their fill of mutual attraction in their early days and let them settle with me because I'm as ugly as them now? Hot, damn! What an epiphany! Who needs to be desired when you can have someone settle for you later when they're done with their fun? I mean, the general consensus at 30 is that you better not be a virgin or else risk being labelled a creep, but surely some woman can pity me enough to give me her vagina and maybe some half-arsed attempt at intimacy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You wanna help me, mate?

Then don't condescend me with bullshit that I have heard so many countless times before. 

"Oh, what's that? People that I've never talked to are making fun of me on the train because of my personality? Damn, I never knew how easy it was for people to pick out self-loathing from a momentary glance, I guess it's nothing to do with the fact that I'm a weird-looking dude."

Face it,man. People put value on physical appearance, so much value as to dictate the path of an initial social interaction. Sure, maybe if I had a 'good personality' girls would see past my physical flaws or whatever bullshit, but the fact that I get rejected from the first second they see me crushes any hope I might have that 'personality trumps appearance'.

So, what should I do? Fix my 'defeatist attitude' and walk blindly through life in the hope that if maybe I had a good personality, then people would like me, despite facing constant rejection no matter how hard I try?

I don't want a date with a great-looking girl. I don't want to be a fucking novelty, some guy 'punching above his weight'; I want to be treated like a person. I want to date people based on personality, but in my experience, people couldn't give two shits about your personality if you don't appeal to them on a physical level.

Sure, you may have an attractive personality but your physical attractiveness determined whether someone was going to interact with you on a deep enough level to get a fuller picture of your personality in the first place. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just discovered this sub from your brigading efforts over in /r/ForeverAlone, and was wondering why you're all so angry at Nice Guys.

Maybe I should preface this with the fact that, no, I'm not one of your "Nice Guys". I don't interact with women because I know they don't want to interact with me. I know that I don't 'deserve sex', don't blame women for my problems, yadda yadda.

So why so much hate for the socially inept? Most of these Nice Guys are people who didn't receive the social gratification many of you take for granted,but you earned that on your own, right? ;).

 Does it make a lot of you angry that these men are failing in their intimate relationships because it was so easy for you?

 I mean, I can understand calling out guys for being dicks to people, but what I don't understand is the hypocrisy in this sub. 

I'd imagine the only difference between a "Nice Guy" and a "Normal Functioning Person as Dictated by this Sub" is that one is successful while the other is not? Or am I wrong? Are your efforts to find an intimate partner different because you 'worked hard' for them whilst these damned Nice Guys just expect everything to fall into their lap?

Now, don't misconstrue my words. I despise people demanding sex, but from what I've seen of this sub, a lot of the guys you mock are legitimately lamenting a lack of success in forming partnerships. Is that such a bad thing? Is that not what people do when faced with rejection? Lament, get angry, all those natural human responses?

I mean, many of you guys were coming into a sub full of people who have faced constant rejection ( and many of whom have also lost all hope) to condescend or mock them. I mean, do you actually think that "no one is ugly, just make yourself not ugly"? 

Do you also tell homeless people to just make themselves not homeless? Or people in wheelchairs to just walk?

I'm not saying anyone is against me, I'm just describing a basic human attribute and how it can guide other human's perceptions; Face it, mate. People value physical attractiveness first and foremost. Why are you having trouble with that? Do you honestly think the way you look has no effect on how people respond to you?

And for every successful 'buttface', there were likely several, equally kind 'buttfaces' who didn't end up happily married. Do you think of them? What about that weird kid every school has that everyone thought would shoot up the place? Or the thousand other undesirables shunned and condescended by people like you, all the while being constantly berated about 'how that one time some random ugly guy got a girlfriend or something', and that 'looks don't matter, only your personality does'. 

Did they all 'suck as people'? 

And you still haven't answered my question, but I will for you: You didn't stay with those unattractive women because for all their 'personality' and everything, you couldn't fathom yourself actually entering into a serious, long-term monogamous relationship with them and went for someone prettier.

Of course it comes down to looks with me, have you forgotten the fact that I'm ugly? My life has been determined by the way I look, similar to yours. We're just on different scales of the spectrum; people respond nicely to you because you're good looking, thus granting you self-esteem and validation and thus granting you the illusion of personal achievement whereas people respond negatively to me because I'm ugly, thus destroying self-esteem and giving no validation. Is that so hard to understand?

And how are my views on women disgusting? Because I don't patronise unattractive women by assuming that the physical attractiveness of a potential partner doesn't matter to them?

Also, you didn't answer my previous questions. Did you stay long with any of these 'physically unattractive women'? </TEXT>

That's the dilemma, isn't it mate? To overcome loneliness, I'd have to date someone as unattractive as myself who would also find me unattractive. You reckon that's a good thing? No mutual attraction between intimate partners? 

It sucks, it does. I wish I could not factor someone's physicality into how I interact with them, but I, like everyone here (including those who won't admit it) can't completely dismiss how someone looks.

If you have to ask this question, you clearly haven't experienced what it is like to be unattractive. I, like yourself,like anyone,can't just stop myself from desiring physically beautiful people and start desiring ugly people. Fuck, I wish I could.

<TEXT> To any modders out there,

SE combat needs a little more variety, IMO, and I think the addition of some kind of cruise missile launcher for large ships ( think something like the US MK 143 or a Tomahawk launcher) would be an awesome addition to the fairly limited large ship weapon collection. I'd do it myself but I have no clue as to how to code and have fairly basic modelling skills. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wanna know what combat is like in Starmade?

There is no use for small ships; every ship you see is a gargantuan behemoth with enormous amounts of shields/guns/speed. Combat literally boils down to who can build the biggest ship.That's it. No manoeuvring, no clever building, no engineering custom weapons or ammunition.  And combat is all the game is really about, as you don't have to really worry about basic Newtonian physics/ resources all that much as : 

a. There is no Newtonian physics, and
b. Resources are so incredibly easy to come by ( stations, etc,) and building is as easy as Minecraft.

Meaning you can pretty much focus straight away on attacking other players, not balancing resources/build time like you need to in SE.

Sure, it has infinite worlds and logic implemented, but that's all it has over Space Engineers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, definitely.

The time frame in which I'm writing is set maybe a hundred or so years after the largest revolution known to the world of Wa: Gasin's Revolt ( Or The Fall of the Old Monarchy.

To paraphrase, Gasin was a wealthy merchant living under the reign of the Othenai Emperor in PL 1200 who overthrew the monarchy in 1205. 

Merchants of that time were required to pay support-funds for wars of the realm. The Emperor of that time was engaged in a lengthy war with a smaller state which was draining on the resources of the merchants. Gasin was the first to say, ' Nope, fuck you. I'm out,' and stopped paying his wartax. 

This caused an uproar from the nobility and the Emperor himself, who proceeded to have Gasin arrested. Gasin fled to a neighbouring kingdom and formed a group of like-minded merchants who then convinced the under class to rise up and depose the king. They did so enthusiastically and overran the state's capitol, butchering the Emperor and his entire extended family.

Gasin then took reign of the state, forming a council of other merchants to rule over the bits of land he kept from the collapsing Othenai Empire. Gasin and his Golden Teeth ( a term for both his actual teeth, which were gold, and the council of merchants he assembled) however went back on their promises to the underclass of 'every man has a voice' and instead established an oligarchical company-state called Authon. There was mass unrest again, but Gasin was lucky in that he was able to garner support against the rebellion by classing it as a rebellion of 'radical puritans', blaming the unrest on Authon's minority Axar population and the Church of the Fertile Womb. In doing so, Gasin turned the hatred felt by the multi-cultural underclass towards a single group of people long thought of as devious and insular, and avoided he himself being deposed. 

Such was the work of Gasin Golden-Teeth, First High-Chairman of Authon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the great expanses of tundra of Northern Othen to the moutainous heart of Firlon, the remains of Pre-Light society abound within Wa.

Most prominent of these could be considered wonders, for they are indeed marvellous creations of ancient technological prowess and still puts to shame much of what Post-Light civilisation has built. 

I'll describe two wonders here: one Pre-Light and one Post-Light

**The Mai Space Elevator:** Forever a mystery, the Mai Space Elevator ( or The Finger of Cotmiv, depending on who you talk to) remains the most intact Pre-Light building of the known world. Lying a few kilometres from the city of Mai, its condition is so well-preserved that is it rumoured to still reach space, possibly even connected to some other ancient structure in the distant heavens. 

However such speculations will remain  mystery as the elevator has been held tightly under the thumb of the Atcotmivrosht, the followers of Cotmiv, who deny all entry to the elevator on the grounds of it being a place not to be seen by mortal eyes, and their presence amongt Mai's senior council has made any possibility of exploration improbable. So the Mai Elevator remains untouched, gargantuan and eery as it towers above the hills of Central Othen, visible to the eye for hundreds of kilometers.

**The Pious Walk:**  An enormous procession of huge kneeling statues carved around 800PL, the Pious Walk is perhaps the most well-known wonder of Firlon. Each statue is said to represent some long-dead Huisa monarch, in total  numbering around 450 statues, all in various states of decay. The Pious Walk leads right to the old city gates of Ntua, ending it the unfinished statue of the most recent monarch, Boja the Seventeenth, who was beheaded during the fall of the Huisa regime in 1213 PL. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, greetings from Australia: the land of VB, utes and wilful ignorance. 

Bit of a weird title,sorry, but I guess I had to try and grab someone's attention with pure, exploitative bluntness. 

Ol' mate Jackal's wearing my skin.

Well, not actually wearing my skin physically (at least I don't think so), but he's certainly not just in his own fur now. It's kinda strange as well because I thought he'd gotten used to me getting used to his worm-hair stuff ( Whatever the fuck it is; it's not really like worms, though-- more like thin seaweed caught in a tough current while it's still rooted to the rocks. Weird how it just floats like that.)

Anyway, I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions as to what I should do. I've tried asking him to stop wearing my likeness, but he talks too quickly. Always has. Sounds kind of like if you got three people and a goat and pumped them full of helium and then compressed them flat, letting out all the helium in one big rush. So a mixture of high-pitched animal/human squeals? Kinda hilarious sometimes. It hurts to listen other times.

I mean, I've known him since I was six, but this is the first time he's actually changed appearance. 

What should I do?

<TEXT> Hey guys. I've been following the CGCookie tutorial on creating a Low-poly mesh for game design and I've run into some trouble. 

After rearranging the UVs and preparing to bake the normals, a weird circle that only appears in object mode appeared at the base of my mesh. Seen [here](http://imgur.com/a4XMp9e)

I also believe that this mystery circle is screwing up my normal bake and causing it to look like [this](http://imgur.com/Z6iUd7I). Also in that picture you can see that the origin of the low-poly has somehow changed, so to bake I have to manually move it closer to the high-poly.

I've tried recalculating the normals, flipping the normals, etc, but nothing works.

Have I accidentally hit a button that I shouldn't have? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but without the French the Revolution wouldn't have gotten anywhere. You could argue the same thing in Eastern Ukraine: A small amount of Eastern Ukrainians were legitimately angry with the Kiev revolt and decided to revolt themselves. Russia took advantage of the situation and poured forth supplies and manpower into the rebels.

A lot of Western media seems to portray the Eastern Ukrainians as never actually wanting to secede and that the Russians basically manufactured all of the dissent, but I doubt the Russians would've had so much success in escalating the conflict if there hadn't been at least some grievance amongst the local population. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad worked on the set of The Matrix and has a few stories to tell about his experience there. Apparently, Keanu wasn't as nice as people today think him to be. 

According to my dad, Keanu made a general mess of his caravan in a fit of anger and my dad was called over to fix the wardrobe. My dad, being the verbal kind of guy he is, expelled a variety of obscenities, some along the lines of, "What fuckwit did this?" 

Much to my father's chagrin, the perpetrator of such fuckwitry was no other than Keanu Reeves himself who had still been residing within the caravan. On hearing my father's exclamation, ol' mate Keanu exited the caravan in a huff, but before he left he kicked in the door, turning to my dad and saying something like, "Something else for you to fix."

Probably left out some details as I haven't heard my dad tell the story for a long, long time, but that's the general gist of it.

edit:My dad appears in the credits of the film. Sources:

<TEXT> Top of the list would be The Illumination ( The Light of Toruzh, The Judgement, etc.) 

Two or three thousand years prior to when my story is set, the civilisations of Wa had reached a technological golden age. A number of space elevators had been constructed, transhumanism was the norm and Wa had finally established a equilibrium with its environment.

However, the sun Toruzh ( thought to be the eye of the God Toruzh by Eastern Othenai tradition) emitted a powerful solar flare that rendered most of the technologies created by man worthless and plunged them into a dark age lasting around 450-500 years. Countless hundred of millions died from starvation, disease and exposure as their machines ceased to save them from Wa's harsher aspects. Along with their technologies went all recorded data not written down, leaving the inhabitants of Wa still wondering to this day at what life may have been like for Pre-Light folk.

What value does the light of hope have compared

<TEXT> Contemporary armies of Wa make heavy use of projectile based weaponry. 

E.g. The Military Arm of the Authon Corporation equips its average soldier with a repeater. Repeaters are side-loaded, semi-automatic rifle-esque weapons that use a mixture of compressed air and magnetism to project small shards of metal. Due to the method of propulsion, projectiles from repeaters have a small range of fire, and thus regular soldiers are extremely dependant on artillery ( both static and mobile), exosuits, and melee.

Most heavier vehicles are equipped with larger version of said repeaters ( like the Monk-class MK.1 exosuit which uses dual heavy repeaters), or long-guns that fire a wide variety of spear-like projectiles. Other types of vehicles (land and air) also carry dumb-missiles, bombs or flamethrowers)

Artillery in Wa use traditional, Pre-Light powder-based munitions. Powder-based weapons are rare outside of artillery due to the rarity of saltpeter. That doesn't stop the armies of Wa from blasting the ever-living fuck out of each other with countless tonnes of explosive artillery rounds however. No one know how much saltpeter is left in the world, but it is used solely for military products. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gonna take some text from a older post of mine to give some back story to my interactions with a particular girl:

"Hey guys. I'm a bit new to this whole relationship-with-another-sex biz, being as I've had quite a bit of trouble with girls/women in the past and that I've never had a girlfriend/kissed/had sex/all that good intimate relationship stuff, so bear with me if I sound a bit naive or dickheaded as I'm pretty much running on a teenager's understanding of relationships. So, the story goes that I met this girl at a party where I was quite drunk. I found her quite attractive and so mustered all the liquored-up courage I could find to talk to her. We got on pretty well and I ended up getting her phone number. I asked her on a date ( I'm pretty sure it was one) a week or so later, and when the time came, I met her and I had a pretty good time. After that, I asked her out again to which she said yes. However this second time she didn't respond to the plans I made for whatever reason ( which I was cool with) and we didn't go out. We still texted however, with her almost always being the one to initiate conversation, as I was too terrified of appearing annoying and/or needy. After some time, we agreed on seeing each other again and this time actually did. It went well again ( I think), except this time I didn't press for another meeting. Again more sporadic texting continued( I'm not so good at maintaining constant contact) with her one day hinting at ( well, not really hinting, she pretty much said, " Let's meet up again.") meeting again. I agreed, we made plans, but we both forgot to follow through. Fast-forward to this week where I asked her out to dinner and she agreed ( as usual). After this she asked me whether or not we were going on a 'date' to which I replied that I don't mind whether it is or not. She decided that we should probably keep it casual, I agreed. I should probably mention that during this whole time communicating with her her I've been trying hard to balance the teenage urges of wanting to finally get my first-kiss/lose my virginity/have a girlfriend and my more realistic attitudes on the fact that she might not want to date me and that her friendship holds just as much value as a possible intimate relationship. So, I'm left wondering whether I should deal with these urges to get a girlfriend by pushing for a more intimate relationship but risk ruining a perfectly good chance at a friendship, or whether I should play it safe but retain a possible deep-seated pining for her to view me as more than a friend that may lead me to becoming resentful and bitter. 

TL;DR: I've been communicating with a girl and have developed a fondness for her but don't know whether I should harness this fondness and channel it into making a lasting friendship with her, or whether I should push for intimacy ( which I am severely lacking in my life)."

In addition to the above previous events, I decided a couple of weeks ago to invite this girl over for a movie marathon. She accepted and we set a date. Today I rang her to figure out when she was coming down tomorrow and she had no clue what I was talking about, asking, " What's happening tomorrow?" She insisted that she did want to come down, but had sprained her ankle and might not be able to. 

I've been noticing that it's been me initiating contact more often than not, and I really don't want to pursue this girl if she's acting with some kind of pity/discomfort towards me.

Sorry for the long post. What should I do?

Thanks in advance.

<TEXT> Was that thing about condoms for raping players a serious suggestion? I really hope not. You should take a moment or ten to think about the consequences of this if it was serious.

Nah, it wasn't serious,haha. Just couldn't think of any more uses for gut. 

Requiring too many steps to get from bear to sleeping bag could get tedious.

Although I hope they would include more complexity, it's more realistic to think that if they did implement things like this, they'd probably be put in as quite simple, requiring maybe a single specialised workbench/item to turn say gut into string and hide into leather instead of a fully in-depth process. 

Still, I think it'd be awesome if they added in a complex method of obtaining certain crafting mats. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Suggestion] Fur,gut, bone and hide: Using the whole animal. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-22 03:45:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my opinion, hunting in Rust could be a hell of a lot more enjoyable if it were to be expanded. It's cool that they've added skulls/bone fragments, but I'd like to see more things added to the list of things you can obtain off of animal's corpses. 

The use of the whole hunted animal should be a defining feature of Rust early-game as it is pretty reminiscent of Neolithic life ( hunter-gatherers), and I believe that it could do with a bit of expansion so we don't just go from sticks and rocks straight to guns. The animals in Rust should be the most important resource for your average nekkid Newman, it should be an momentous occasion when you bring down an animal large enough to provide you with much needed materials. Therefore, I think more animal-only materials should be added and uses for said materials (including expanded uses for bone fragments) should be pivotal to the Rust early-game. 

These materials and their uses would be as follows:

Gut: Used as an alternative to cloth in making bow strings. Used for tripwires (?), rope, or anything that requires some sort of cord/string. Also used for food, to make those drinking bag things and makeshift condoms for better protection whilst raping newspawns. Pulled out raw from animal and needs to be dried on a drying rack.

Fur: Used for making warmer clothing in cold climates, used for beds/sleeping bags, can be burnt on fire as cheap fuel.

Bone fragments/intact bones: Fragments used for jewellery, tools (does this already), needles in primitive medkits (?); larger bones used for weapons, armour, etc

Hide: A replacement for cloth already obtained from animals. Used for armour, storage bags, beds, tents, pretty much everything in Rust early-game. Must be prepared before use, this could be ranging in complexity from actually needing to clean, wash and then tan the leather in respective workbenches, or to just simply using one new workbench ( say, a 'leather rack') to turn fresh hide straight into leather. 

Fat: Can be rendered down in furnace to make glue, also used as fuel ( pretty sure Rust already has this,though)

Meat: I don't know if some kind of deterioration mechanic is planned, but if so, it would be cool if we could salt/dry/smoke meats for future use.

Well, that's all I have for the moment, let me know what you goyim think.

<TEXT> Sweet Jesus.

You've got to let love in, not demand it.

Did you get that off the back of a fucking cereal box? 

It's all nice and good that you believe that we all have hope, and I'm not saying that old mate OP doesn't, but please don't fucking patronise the rest of us that are very well facing the distinct possibility of a life devoid of intimacy ( you know, that one thing most people, likely yourself included, take for granted) with that bullshit. 

And it's all well and good that you find it to be pathetic or sad that some people can't let go of the fact that they will most likely miss out on one of the most validating aspects of human existence, that is, the ability to give and receive intimacy.

Sure, I could go on a holiday, or fucking twelve, but I will still feel hollow, I will still feel like some sort of fucking freak. I mean, what really is there to life but to reproduce? It's a biological imperative that we breed, I can't just shrug that off and say, " Well at least I have done these other, objectively meaningless, pointless activities. Go me!"

Hope is for people who already have had a lifetime of validating social experiences to fall back on. How can I have 'hope for the future' when I can barely talk to the fucking cashier at my local supermarket? 

Do you know what awaits guys like me and many others of this sub? ( Maybe OP, maybe not) We grow further and further into isolation and obsolescence. We become the creeps and spinsters who either kill themselves in some forgotten place or die in old age and are discovered rotted to their couch. However much hope we can put into the future won't change psychological foundations laid on us during early childhood/adolescence. 

We're at the bad end of the bell-curve, and we've just got to deal with that. I choose to ground myself in reality, not fantastical pipe-dreams saturated with such blinding things as hope.

<TEXT> From your comment higher up, you look like a regular dude. 

I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that if you had actually, properly physically unattractive, your girlfriend would have dismissed any effort of yours to pursue an intimate relationship, despite how passionate you are, yadda yadda.

Your personality is attractive because you fit within the threshold of physical attractiveness that dictated whether your girlfriend would date you or not. 

It's fucking strange, you know, that people actually believe that physical attractiveness doesn't affect how you interact with other people. It's all well and good to say, "Well, my girlfriend loves me for my personality," but you ignore the fact that she was attracted to your physicality first and foremost, and then your personality ( although I doubt she would stay with you if you magically became an ugly fucker, personality or no.)

This is what normal people forget, that facial attractiveness initially determines any future interactions you'll have with someone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not commenting so much on sex as I am on finding an intimate relationship. Sure, sex is probably overrated, but I don't want a relationship solely for sex. 

To get someone of the opposite sex to want to be intimate with you is one of THE most important traits of being viewed as a functional person. 

People couldn't give two shits if you think you're alright for not having ever had an intimate relationship as it implies that there's something wrong with you, and people don't like that; they don't like someone like that hanging around them. 

 If you are just looking to get your dick wet, it shouldn't be that difficult, but will still require effort. Make sure you present yourself hygienically, lower your standards and go to a gathering of similarly aged people and start talking to women, not just the stereotypically pretty or cute ones. Talk to everyone. If women see you blowing off the less attractive, plain ones...and then see you only chatting up the attractive ones, you're gonna be seen as an asshole. 

I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, big fella: Ugly people, like normal/good looking people, don't like other ugly people. Just because someone's physically unattractive, doesn't mean they're going to be attracted to similarly unattractive people, and unlike said normal-looking people, I don't subscribe to the vitriolic delusions they feed themselves about 'loving someone for their personality'.*(Top fucking kek.)*  I know a homely girl isn't going to be attracted to me and she knows I'm not going to be attracted to her. That's just how it is.

I subject myself to nature, and nature is cruelly just. The reality of the situation is that there must be someone to fill in the opposite end of the bell curve regarding intimacy and those people are, generally, physically unattractive (disregarding the disabled/deformed). 

I am one such person, and no amount of "talk to everyone" will fix the fact that the sperm that happened to develop into me also carried certain genes that lead to facial unattractiveness/shortness. It's not my fault, it's not your fault, it's not anyone's fault--it's just how things are.

In the worst case scenario, I accept my painful fate of isolation and loneliness with grim determination. In the best case scenario, I kill myself.

That's just how life is,eh?

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure this is still considered under FA jurisdiction. Anyway, here it is: 

"Hey guys.
I'm a bit new to this whole relationship-with-another-sex biz, being as I've had quite a bit of trouble with girls/women in the past and that I've never had a girlfriend/kissed/had sex/all that good intimate relationship stuff, so bear with me if I sound a bit naive or dickheaded as I'm pretty much running on a teenager's understanding of relationships.
So, the story goes that I met this girl at a party where I was quite drunk. I found her quite attractive and so mustered all the liquored-up courage I could find to talk to her. We got on pretty well and I ended up getting her phone number. I asked her on a date ( I'm pretty sure it was one) a week or so later, and when the time came, I met her and I had a pretty good time. After that, I asked her out again to which she said yes. However this second time she didn't respond to the plans I made for whatever reason ( which I was cool with) and we didn't go out.
We still texted however, with her almost always being the one to initiate conversation, as I was too terrified of appearing annoying and/or needy. After some time, we agreed on seeing each other again and this time actually did. It went well again ( I think), except this time I didn't press for another meeting.
Again more sporadic texting continued( I'm not so good at maintaining constant contact) with her one day hinting at ( well, not really hinting, she pretty much said, " Let's meet up again.") meeting again. I agreed, we made plans, but we both forgot to follow through.
Fast-forward to this week where I asked her out to dinner and she agreed ( as usual). After this she asked me whether or not we were going on a 'date' to which I replied that I don't mind whether it is or not. She decided that we should probably keep it casual, I agreed.
I should probably mention that during this whole time communicating with her her I've been trying hard to balance the teenage urges of wanting to finally get my first-kiss/lose my virginity/have a girlfriend and my more realistic attitudes on the fact that she might not want to date me and that her friendship holds just as much value as a possible intimate relationship.
So, I'm left wondering whether I should deal with these urges to get a girlfriend by pushing for a more intimate relationship but risk ruining a perfectly good chance at a friendship, or whether I should play it safe but retain a possible deep-seated pining for her to view me as more than a friend that may lead me to becoming resentful and bitter.
What do?
TL;DR: I've been communicating with a girl and have developed a fondness for her but don't know whether I should harness this fondness and channel it into making a lasting friendship with her, or whether I should push for intimacy ( which I am severely lacking in my life). What should I do?
Cheers!"

Thanks, guys.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys.

I'm a bit new to this whole relationship-with-another-sex biz, being as I've had quite a bit of trouble with girls/women in the past and that I've never had a girlfriend/kissed/had sex/all that good intimate relationship stuff, so bear with me if I sound a bit naive or dickheaded as I'm pretty much running on a teenager's understanding of relationships.

So, the story goes that I met this girl at a party where I was quite drunk. I found her quite attractive and so mustered all the liquored-up courage I could find to talk to her. We got on pretty well and I ended up getting her phone number. I asked her on a date ( I'm pretty sure it was one) a week or so later, and when the time came, I met her and I had a pretty good time. After that, I asked her out again to which she said yes. However this second time she didn't respond to the plans I made for whatever reason ( which I was cool with) and we didn't go out. 

We still texted however, with her almost always being the one to initiate conversation, as I was too terrified of  appearing annoying and/or needy. After some time, we agreed on seeing each other again and this time actually did. It went well again ( I think), except this time I didn't press for another meeting.

Again more sporadic texting  continued( I'm not so good at maintaining constant contact) with her one day hinting at ( well, not really hinting, she pretty much said, " Let's meet up again.") meeting again. I agreed, we made plans, but we both forgot to follow through.

Fast-forward to this week where I asked her out to dinner and she agreed ( as usual). After this she asked me whether or not we were going on a 'date' to which I replied that I don't mind whether it is or not. She decided that we should probably keep it casual, I agreed.

<TEXT> I find it admirable that you changed yourself, but what I'm trying to get across is the fact that your genetics, your 'decent looking' appearance, allowed such a change to begin.

I have lost count of the times I have read about people doing very similar 'life changes', but due to their physical appearance, there effort was fruitless.

Let me guess, judging on the fact that you could play basketball, you're at least average-tall height? Do you think you'd be in the same situation now if you'd been 5 foot 4? Or only 5 foot? Were you consistently mocked solely on your appearance in high school? How would you have joined the military and gained all that self-confidence if you'd had colour-blindness, short/long sightedness, any other form of minor or major disability that disallows many people from joining the military.

What I'm trying to say, mate, is that you, myself and most other people attempt to force how they overcame their past troubles onto another's present troubles without giving any thought as to the context of the other person and why they may feel/act the way they do.

It's good that you were able to change yourself, but realise that there are many factors at play that affect whether other people, especially FA people, could possibly change their life's circumstances. For some, there is no light, no green grass, no saviour in the clouds, only a life of agonizing monotony and crippling social rejection, despite any effort to change such a fate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's be honest with ourselves, mate. 

You 'dated down' in looks to an acceptable level in your opinion; appearance still dictated who you went for as you specifically aimed to 'lower your standards', thus taking into account the fact that the girl you were looking for didn't quite meet your preference of appearance, and that you were conceding your 'decent looking' self to date someone lower or equal to how you viewed yourself physically.

Physical appearance most likely still presided over your 'revelation', only now you convinced yourself that it was the *personality*  of your chosen girlfriend, not solely her physicality, that you desired.

I have no doubt whatsoever if that 10/10 personality woman you were searching for looked like a foot, your 'decent looking' self would continue his search elsewhere for a mate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Potato mash,sweetie?"

And here it was. 

That small white,lumpy hill of churned starch,butter and milk, served up on his favourite plate--the one with the colourful stegosauruses parading along its rim--sat testament to his corruption, his betrayal...*his murder.*

Heinrich felt as if he was on trial;his once blue high-chair felt as though it held him in place, a barbaric restraint for a barbarian. He squirmed under the lifeless, accusatory gaze of his former allies-- these once proud, dirt-caked, Lords of Soil and Grit now reduced to this formless, buttery aberration.

The dinosaurs on his plate also sat in silent judgement, their scaled mouths down turned in odium at the mangled corpse-pile held within their bowl. He failed to meet their eyes and stared at his spoon instead, begging for his hungry salivating to stop.

Heinrich had sworn, he had *sworn* to not become this monster, to stave off his based, involuntary desires. He had been a friend of all potatokind, a rare demonstration of the viability of human-vegetable non-aggression. And now here he was. A proponent of a different type of interaction, one that only benefited a single party:his.

It wasn't purely his fault,though. *She* was also to blame--it had been *her* that had made them tasty and buttery and creamy and fun to throw around the dining table.

At first he had had none of it. 

Not a single bite,nothing. He hadn't even allowed himself to breathe in the stench of such barbarity, his moral instincts had caused him to easily resist her debauched temptations. A swift report to the Potato Lord afterwards had reaffirmed his vigilance to potatokind, to them and to his own conscience. He had stood amongst the people of Pantryton and declared his undying love for their culture and people, had promised as long as this love continued, so would his protection. 

But then she had come again, this time with sauce. 

And, may the Potato God forgive his misdeeds,it had been tomato sauce. Rich, red, salty-sweet tomato sauce. Not even the usual stuff,mind you. The kind that came in a jar, not a cheap, rubbery bottle.

And she had lathered it on. 

Completely drowned the poor, broken bodies in it. The potato to sauce ratio had been insanely skewed in the favour of the sauce, and he knew it was deliberate. She knew how to play him, she knew his weaknesses.

As he had sat in his high-chair, he had begged for strength from the Potato God, but He had not answered his pleas. He had whispered prayers to the fallen before him,had planed to even hold a vigil in their honour, yet the sauce beckoned. 

It had promised his taste buds a pleasure so intense that his mouth had not been able to control itself, his hands had worked against his righteous might. And the sauce had not been lying, they tasted beyond anything he had ever imagined.

At first he had felt empty--a broken hero and a traitor whose insatiable appetite for sauce had caused him to break a vow that he had previously thought to be unbreakable.

 And then he had felt hungry.

His hunger had consumed him. Mash was being served daily, and he was devouring it like some voracious beast.

 His now pitifully weak conscious had desperately tried to cling to the virtues that had once constituted his heroic image, but its fight had been like that of a fruit mite's pathetic struggle to feed itself as its host apple rushed towards the school desk, both oblivious to their impending splatter.

Within a week, the entire population of Pantryton had been boiled, squished and eaten by their saviour. Not even the kumara had been spared.

He should have quit, he should have paid reparations to the now depleted potato village, he should be ashamed of this egregious slaughter.

Heinrich gulped down the last of the saliva and picked up his spoon.

But he liked it.

<TITLE> [Suggestion] Mortal wounding and internal bleeding. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-26 04:11:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Kind of a simple suggestion,really. I think that more variation in the way you are wounded in a fight with another player through a slightly deeper injury system would make pvp that much more intense. 

I suggest that the possibility of either becoming mortally wounded or suffering internal bleeding after being shot/axed/can-openered would add a nice higher risk factor to conflict. 

It could be as simple as adding another modifier [Mortally Wounded/Internally Bleeding] to the player's status after being hit in a certain area (chest) or by a certain calibre weapon that stays with them until they die from it, (it would be random,of course) or as complex as having different types of internal injuries (lungs,stomach,intestines) lead to varying times of death, with characters who have been hit in places like the stomach/intestines periodically crumpling/falling over due to intense pain before dying a slow,agonizing death a short distance away from where they were shot in contrast to characters hit in the throat/lungs gasping for air and coughing up blood whilst squirming on the floor. Accompanying animations/audio effects would be pretty cool as well. So would blood trails, but I don't know whether that'd be possible.

I feel that a lot of fights end up with both parties being shot, but only one surviving thanks to his insta-heal bandage, even if he was hit directly in the chest. Picture this:

Imagine you're scavenging through Elektro with a mate. You make a quick pass of the school but are ambushed by another player. Your mate is hit in the throat and goes down, his character gurgling and writhing on the floor while you are hit in the stomach. Your character falls to the floor as well, but you quickly make it back up and find cover. You can barely see as your character is in a great deal of pain/shock and you know you're about to die, but you decide to take whoever shot you with you into the inky black. You bandage up to stop the external bleeding, even though you know you're screwed anyway and make your way around and into the school--your character falls again as legs are failing him. You find el bandito smugly rearranging his inventory in one of the school rooms and blast the fucker. The last of your character's strength fails him and he falls into unconsciousness and the death but at least you got your revenge.

 Having a chance for bullets to become lodged in a character, requiring the need to be pulled out with pliers lest the character remain in constant pain and run the risk of infection,would be a nice addition as well.

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

I mean, all someone would have to do to improve their relationship with me would be to be nice to me, but I'm supposed to have something extra to garner their attention?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Number of independent states in a world. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-01 11:52:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey,guys. 

Long-time lurker here who's recently begun to kick himself back into worldbuilding to supplement my desire to continue on with my novel.


I was wondering about the number of unique states I have in my world and whether there's too few of them for a world roughly the same size as the Earth;I have six autonomous states at the moment, with the world being respectively divided between them. Two are oligarchies run by pseudo-merchants/wealthy families, one is a transhumanist theocracy,one is an absolute monarchy,one is an autocracy determined by a cultural hegemony and one is a partial democracy.

At the moment, my worldmap looks pretty bland in terms of state diversity and amount. Each state holds enormous swathes of land and the more I look at it, the more I'm thinking that maybe I should invest in creating a few smaller states to bring about a more realistic geo-political environment.

What do you guys think?       </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey,guys. I don't think a post like this goes against the rules. If so, I'll delete it.

I heard somewhere on Reddit/Facebook that smoking cannabis can aid in alleviating some symptoms of depression and so was wondering, as I'm fairly depressed,whether I should consider it as an option to help me gain back some semblance of normality.

 My mum is a daily user and has often noted that smoking gives her heightened creative motivation which resounds quite a lot with me as one of the biggest things I've come to miss is my want to write, which has pretty much been killed off due to my general apathy towards everything.

However I've also heard that marijuana can exacerbate depressive symptoms, so I'm a bit conflicted as to whether I should take up smoking or not.

What's your opinion on cannabis' effectiveness in dealing with depression? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe not in all cases but in some. I'm gonna post a personal anecdote in response to this.

To preface, I'm a pretty fucking ugly guy. I was going up to attend a friend's party on the train, and because I'm relatively small and nervous around other people, I chose a seat away from most people. A group of girls and one other guy hopped on and sat maybe four or five seats ahead of me. 

I didn't look at these people, I minded my own business. It was about half-way through the trip when I heard them discussing me, about how I was 'creepy' ( mind you, I hadn't looked at them at all)and about how they'd probably kill themselves if they woke up to a face like mine. They later stuck a note on the back of my bag as I left saying 'Fuck me, I'm desperate.'

I guess the point of this post is, some women (and men) do label unattractive guys 'creepy', even if they have had not prior social contact with them. I should also note that I was dressed appropriately (no scorpion jacket or fedora, *lol people who wear fedoras are so retarded, amirite?*), and had just had a haircut that most would deem 'socially acceptable'. There was no reason beyond my face that these people would find me creepy. 

Edit: Shit at grammar. I'll never make it as a writer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look around here, do you see many photos of people? Who do you think frequents this sub usually? 

Of course a photo of a somewhat attractive woman is going to be treated differently than any other post; this entire sub is pretty much centred around the rejection and isolation of young, socially awkward men by women or other men. 

A woman posting something here is a rarity, and a picture even more so. Hell, do you see men posting pictures of themselves often here? A picture of an attractive woman here is going to blow up ten-fold, even if it is about the most asinine subject, which, at least speaking for myself, makes me feel as if it is disingenuous in nature and plays to the fact that this sub comprises mainly of lonely men. (whether I'm right or wrong). 

Whether OP knew of this or not, the negative response was not to the fact that she had no right to be FA because she was female, but to this feeling of her being a female exploiting the generally male user base to garner attention.

This is a sub, much like your own (SRS), that is a melting pot of negative emotions, and sometimes those emotions lash out against seemingly innocent people. 

OP,you probably weren't using your sex to gain attention, however the responses you received weren't because you 'aren't allowed' to be FA, as some of the SRS posters are implying, but because you posted a seemingly normal photo of yourself attached to an arbitrary subject  to a sub that rarely has anything like that occur and consists mainly of lonely males.

And to the SRS poster above me, I see no need for abuse. We get it, you hate men, but this sub already pretty much hates itself, so applying the same blanket hate on the men here as you do the rest of Reddit is a pretty lowly move. 

The last thing most of these guys need (myself included) is to be reminded of how much women hate us.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry that happened to you.

I agree looks don't hold anything towards someone's experiences/story/whatever, but they do build assumptions. You can't deny that being a female on this sub is a rarity and so any posts by one will invariably be treated either hostilely or in a desperately friendly sort of way based on the assumption (whether wrong or not) that women are the centre of our woes. Thus, even though you may not have been looking for attention, it will automatically be assumed that you are based on your gender by at least someone.

It's shitty but, again, lots of negativity around here. </TEXT>

People always waffle on about that whole 'be confident,have hobbies, go to the gym, then you too can be like us normal looking people',but that's just not the case. It sounds shitty, but physically unattractive people are pretty much fucked when it comes to achieving the same sort of satisfaction in relationships as normal/attractive people. No amount of confidence is going to make someone who dates you feel proud of who they are dating if you're ugly. You'll always be seen as inferior, and besides, even if you do end up finding someone, you're probably not going to be attracted to them, anyway. 

Everyone's shallow. </TEXT>

That there's the problem,mate. You're expecting something. Unfortunately,happiness isn't a guarantee and just because you 'do good things', doesn't mean you deserve women's affection.

<TEXT> Probably should have put 'people' instead of 'women',sorry. Although, I would  make the assumption that the people most creeped out by these guys would generally be women.

But you're right, it isn't the women's fault for rejecting them. The sad thing is, it's most likely no one's fault. These guys are just unlucky products of something that must've happened in their past that royally fucked up their ability to form relationships with the opposite sex. The problem probably compounded overtime as they faced rejection because of it, which in turn made them more desperate for some connection, which in turn made them more creepy, which in turn made them become more and more alienated to the point where they rely on dolls to obtain any form of intimacy.

Now they're at the point were rejection is an expected outcome for probably any desire for a relationship because of this world they've created to hide from society's branding of them as a creep, a world ,which in turn, makes them even more unnerving to people.

It's pretty sad.

So I just received an invitation from a girl in one of my uni classes to go to her birthday party. A bunch of people from this particular class have been invited, so I'm not under any special consideration or anything. However I don't really talk to anyone much in the class, so I was a bit surprised when I got the invite. There will also be a whole bunch of people there that I haven't met before so I'm worried that if I go, I will pretty much isolate myself as I don't really 'know' anyone.

What should I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! This is an awesome idea. I don't have Spotify but I should be able to manage a bunch of YouTube links. Could you make me a playlist centred around a sombre mood? Like the kind of music you'd hear if you were exploring a ruined city ,or were about to kill someone you love. I'm not a serial killer,btw. I'm a writer and this kind of music helps me visualise scenes. If it's any help,I usually listen to artists like The Fleet Foxes,Bon Iver and Massive Attack.

*Edit:Thanks heaps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, guys.

I have almost non-existent social skills when it comes to meeting new people and one of the largest barriers I frequently come across is that I can never initiate conversation with anyone. I've been at uni for almost two semesters now and I have still yet to develop a proper social life;I have only really been able to talk to one other person out of all my classes at uni.

I barely see the friends I do have, and I can almost go whole weeks without speaking to anyone but my aunty. So I was wondering if any of you guys know how I can overcome my fear of talking to strangers?

Thanks heaps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What was this man's name? Christ, everyone has a name.

Where had he lived? On a farm as I had? Did he too cherish memories of wide,clear sky reflected in small diaphanous ponds and welcome the calm blanketing of darkness on his fields after sunset had burnt itself into his retinas at the end of each day?

Had he also shared a million small moments with his lover, knowing things that only they had experienced? Had he held his lover's hand as she died of sickness as I had? Had he too broken the hope of his children when he'd explained where she'd gone? 

Is this why he was here?

Is this why he fought? For the same reasons as I do? Was he a broken man seeking solace in the face of this indifferent beast of war?

Did he dream of the feint chatter of wind-chimes before an angry,unforgiving horizon? Is that what kept him restful during the cold nights and their symphony of artillery barrages, when the only light to be found was in hellish flashes against a choked,pitiful landscape?

Had he also seen men wail before the arms of death as they clutched their organs as offerings? Did he fear silence as I do? Had he heard the breathless rattles of men seeking comfort from the impatient embrace of non-existence as they bled their life and memories onto the mud?

My chest tightened as I watched him splutter.

 If I was still the same man as I had been I would have left him to be found by his comrades. He would have lived.

But his eyes were too familiar, they begged with a pathetic fear akin to my own. What right  do I have to decide the fate of another wretched creature such as myself? What grand scheme directed these dire circumstances between us?

I felt my empathy curdle and lose its hold on my thoughts. 

Because he was not like me.

And so I shot him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah,that's probably it. 

As I was getting towards the end of school I was getting more and more worried about missing out on the 'normal teenage-life milestones' that and so I probably figured "Hey, that girl was friendly to me earlier, I should have a crush on her. Maybe then I'll achieve what's expected to have been done by my age and become normal."

Pined over her for sometime but never really talked to her or did anything, and now I'm still holding myself to the fact that I missed my only chance to actually overcome my fear of women and be accepted into the wider 'class' of those who can establish intimate relationships with the opposite sex which in turn exacerbates my awkwardness and fear which in keeps me from allowing myself to even consider dating properly. 

I'm now pretty much proper fucked when it comes to women and socialising in general. It's funny how one simple decision can fuck you over in the longer run,eh? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad it made sense to someone. I agree with you on the stigma towards depressed people in our society, especially towards men. It's almost as if we're told as men that emotion is something you hold within yourself or express to, in limited circumstances, only your loved ones, and if you hold too much emotion, you're overreacting and being a woman. 

Combining this perspective with my sleight build and short height makes me feel almost feminine in the eyes of other men, and this weighs down heavily on me.

Thanks for your words and welcome to the sub!  </TEXT>

I'm going to recommend you see a therapist, not because I think that that mine will necessarily help me, but because I believe everyone should be entitled to a chance to change their lives. Whilst my chance may have well abandoned me, I'd like to think that yours hasn't.

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply; the community here is awesome. 

I have a hard time conveying emotion to people, even my family. I always feel that it isn't my place to burden them with my emotional problems as they've already got their own. 

I find myself thinking like this with my counselor,too. I think about how many people's sob stories he has to sit through and how that must weigh down on his patience. 

For some reason I have this notion that men are not supposed to give into their emotions and seek help, and therefore I mustn't be a man and mustn't have a valid reason for this pain. Your response has offered me a different perspective to what I'm used to, thanks. I don't often open up to people (only when I'm considerably drunk) so the outpouring of good advice and care in this thread has confounded me. </TEXT>

My computer will crash randomly whilst playing some games, and when I check my event log, it tells me that these crashes are due to a Kernel-Power Event. 
On further investigation it appeared that my GPU was the cause behind these crashes,so I've decided that if they continue, I'll probably have to replace my GPU. Question is, which GPU should I buy if I choose to do so? (keeping in mind I'd prefer to upgrade in performance as well). Or should I spend money on getting my GPU fixed instead? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indifference.

I believe that one of the greatest achievements in human evolution is our development of empathy. To know that so many people in the world do what they do without any consideration of the experiences of others and how their decisions may affect others, without even the tiniest shred of empathy, really unnerves me.

And to think that (at least Western) societies could become even more apathetic to the lives of even those who are closest to them, is especially worrying. I mean indifference isn't some modern construct endemic to modern society, but I believe it could become almost a virtue of our age. It's the universe's position to be indifferent to our plight, not humanity's. </TEXT>

I recently read the post on r/askreddit about advice for writing and realised that I may have been pretty lazy in my writing so far, so I was wondering if anyone could tell me how sloppy my writing has gotten and also give any general feedback on mood/characterisation. It's at ~15,000 words at the moment, so I'm about 6 or so chapters in.

Thanks in advance :D

<TEXT> Hey, guys. I've been suffering a fairly large bout of depression recently and was hoping I could kickstart my love of gaming again as I've lost enjoyment of it. If anyone is up for some Chivalry, Minecraft, Starmade or any other multiplayer game that we both own, I'd be more than happy to add them on Steam. My Steam id is dimitricatnikov. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have a picture but I can try to describe as best I can. Could you draw me a woman of about 35 years who has dark brown skin and her long,brown skin hair braided in an intricate pattern,almost like a the pattern of a doiley if you've ever seen one. She should have bright green eyes and a stern,angry look. Starting from her forehead,there should be a tattoo of a bird who's wings stretch down each cheek and its beak should stop just above her nose. The bird should be coloured blue and green . I hope that description is adequate,I can give more details if you want. Thanks,heaps . :) </TEXT>

The context behind it is that he's deserted the army and find's a picture of a happy family on his way back, which he doesn't have, and it breaks him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is incredibly difficult to not be labeled as such. I make a point of never letting my friends know whether I'm feeling depressed or not because of the same fear that you have: that they will dismiss it as 'not their problem'. Unfortunately, when I drink I let my depression come to the surface and begin ranting about the meaninglessness of existence, which I feel alienates me slightly every time. I put it down to my belief that 'normal' people are afraid of depressed individuals; we are foreign to them in our behaviour and it unsettles them, even if they try to empathise they are still unnerved a little by us. They see in us an existence that they can't fully comprehend without having been there, and attempt to visualise what it would be like for them,which scares them, and so some try to distance themselves. Just as we (speaking from my perspective) can't understand what makes them happy, they can't understand what makes us depressed all the time, and so they label us as 'The Depressed Person'.By doing this it essentially isolates what we do and how we think and classifies it as the behaviour of the depressed, something they should try not to get involved in in case our negativity 'rubs off' onto them. This is just my observation ,however, I don't even know if all this made sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is incredibly close to how I feel. Even now,sitting in a lecture by myself, I can see a glimpse of.everyone else's potential personalities,but when I think of myself I can't remember what I used to be like. It's like I'm almost apart from everyone's reality,stuck in my own lonely existence. I wish I could escape and enter the 'living' world. Do you feel this way,too? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my pc has started restarting randomly while I'm using it. Sometimes it will restart as I'm starting it up, other times it will restart while I'm in the middle of a game. The weird thing is, though, it doesn't happen every time I start up a game. Sometimes I can play uninterrupted for hours, have a break, and then it will do it. It also does this thing where it will boot up, but the screen will go black even though I can hear the welcome noises on my headphones.

<TEXT> If someone could draw me a picture of a small, coffee-skinned girl of about 15 or so with long, light brown hair holding an insect that is half the length of her. The insect would basically look like a massive centipede without the bottom antennae;it has no eyes, only four long,thin antennae on it head and a set of large serrated mandibles. It is also almost see-through. This would make my month if it could be drawn. Thanks,guys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Emptiness is a fucked thing, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The feeling that a sooner death could outweigh the endless possibilities that life presents is hard to shake sometimes. I've tried, but that notion stills persists. I can't give you any way of successfully filling that void,but I can empathize with you. I don't know much about life but if you just need someone to vent your troubles on,I'd like to help in whatever way I can. I hate seeing people share this shitty emptiness. </TEXT>
