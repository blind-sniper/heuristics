<TEXT> Its not easy. I've realized I have to stop living in the past and build the future. Or we will never recover. It takes time and effort. I've been clean a year and I've been struggling with keeping myself busy. At the same time I have a father battling addiction at home. Which is tough on me mentally. I go to work stay positive and see good friends time to time. I've done some fucked up stuff too and I'm still reeling the pain. I live a normal life today and I am okay. I get in my head sometimes but I reach out for help and eventually I feel okay again. "Nothing changes, if nothing changes" With all your power you have keep trying to fight your fears and do whats right for your life. I would suggest getting a job as it would keep you busy. Staying in touch with your sponsor and building a sober network. Congrats on reaching out this is the right step! : ) </TEXT>

Good luck my friend. Wish you the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there, this is usually how it went with me in the beginning of recovery. When you are in a rehab or sober house it is much easier because you have a support system and others going through a similar situation. Would you be able to get checked into a sober house ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought the same thing at first. When I was getting high and drunk all the time I had girls, lots of friends and I was outgoing. The reality was they were not my friends. The girls were fake. I was living a life that I was not happy with. Now I have my family, few friends keep to myself and life is good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never considered myself a alcoholic either but my father is so I rather not. If I start drinking, eventually I will fall to drugs someway along the way, I've seen alot of friends try to drink and go back to drugs. I do have a very few friends who were addicted to drugs and managed to just drink here and there. There lives were better and happier. Its a mind fuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats great!!! I am by means not perfect today. I still struggle and I am stubborn sometimes about getting help. But as addicts I've  learned we have to reach out to others to maintain our sobriety. I'm glad you mentioned it here on the forum its better than sitting in your head and just holding in everything. Good luck brotha! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its all in our heads man. Last time I relapsed it was because I went to see my bestfriend who was still a heroin addict. I wasn't craving at all. I thought I was doing good in recovery but I was winging it. This time around I still struggled but when I confront my fears and talk about how I feel and reach out to others I feel at ease and peace with my mind. Its like we choose either to recover or go back. If a old friend hits you up who still uses and wants to hangout there is no use, unless you want to go back to that life. If you drive pass a trigger area you have to think to yourself wow I came so far and I am clean and sober today and life is good. Positive thoughts. The past is the past. Thats the mentality I want to believe. When you believe you achieve. Just my thoughts. Congrats on your recovery you are doing great! This is no walk in the park! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I quit drinking when I turned 21. (I'm 24 now) Father is an alcoholic drinks alot. I don't think I ever hit rock bottom but everyone experiences it differently. I was just to a point where I was miserable and tired of chasing my addiction in circles and killing my family while I did it. If your willing to stop get to a meeting and speak whats on your mind. It took me 3 detoxes, rehab, 3 out patient programs to finally know I had to quit. Or it was death. Better sooner my friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there, 

I took adderall and started abusing it right away I was taking almost ten pills a day. It later led on to cocaine and more stuff along the way. I would suggest taking it easy these next couple days, the withdrawls do not last long. Drink lots of water and take a multivitamin. Throw away the rest of your drugs. Get to a meeting when you are feeling better and do not think you are okay after getting through the withdrawal phase this is just the start. Sometimes our brains trick ourselves and say we are better when we really are not. Talk to someone in a meeting, grab a number if you can. You have nothing to be ashamed of millions of people have struggled with addiction. If you want to feel better and happy and leave that guilt and shame behind do what I said. That is what ultimately helped me. I mean if you can get to a detox that would be better but you need recovery support for a while to build a good mental stronghold again. Goodluck my friend. Thanks for reaching out. I have faith you will do the right thing.

<TEXT> I've told my coworkers and no ones ever judged me. What other people think doesn't matter. Its what you know matters. The people who matter will care and understand and the ones who don't care it will show. I see it as a gift  because it is weeding out the people that don't matter. But it is also something we have to live with. Life is about learning from our mistakes and moving on. Addiction has shown me that I can live a normal sane life without drugs or alcohol or gambling and I take it as a gift and a learning point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there thanks for reaching out that is definitely taking the right step. I used drugs for about 8 years and finally came to a point where I had to stop. Your at a point where you seem like you want to end it. I would suggest trying out a local AA or NA meeting and linking with sober people. You need sober support and if you want you can Pm and I will recommend a few books. Your still addicted you need to acknowledge and move forward with recovery and you will feel much happier. 

Whats kept me sober is cutting out people I would get high with completely. Reaching out to sober people when I needed help. Reading books. Reminding myself that I should be grateful because life could be 100x worse if I never stopped. Helping others with addiction, connecting with people. Not being self centered. Which has always been hard for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Im about a year sober and clean and my father is a active alcoholic who is struggling alot. I would get angry at times and disappointed but I've learned to manage and let him do his thing. You can't force him to recover but if he is willing to get sober give him the tools he needs to do that. Honestly it all comes down to what you want to do. Go home with your father and start drinking with him or go home with your father and work your recovery. I struggled in recovery because I was trying to live a normal life and try to be happy without my recovery tools. Didn't work until I started reaching out to people and going to meetings etc. Having sober people to talk to. So keep doing what your doing. Remember now that your sober you have the choice to pick up again or work your recovery. I can tell you its not going to be easy if your not fully sure on your future and recovery. I wish you the best of luck. If you have any questions let me know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand, I am the most awkward person sociable I hate talking to people I don't know and my heart was thumping out my chest last week when I was getting ready to speak. No one judged me no one gave me dirty looks, the room was silent and understood what I was going through that day. Last week I was full of rage and now I've never been at such peace with myself. Fear is what we need to overcome I wish you luck brother. No rush take it one step at a time. You definitely took the right step speaking about it on here it takes courage. Your on the right path. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there,

I think you should go to some meetings and speak. I did that last week and it totally changed my mind on everything I was going through. Listen to what others are saying and going through it will shed light on your situation. Whether its a newly sober person struggling. It will remind you how good you are doing and that you do not want to go to that dark place ever again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether you do or not that isn't the question. I used cocaine and was addicted for six months than I was on oxycodone and went to heroin. This stuff is no joke. If your willing to put your brother or yourselves futures at risk go ahead and keep doing it. Substances are all a lie. It took me years to finally realize that myself. Nothing wrong with having a addiction. As long as you keep it in the past and do good today. That is what matters. Try something new. I would suggest going to a meeting or getting a sponsor. I was about a year sober and I felt like I was still running I was angry at myself, selfish, and tons of self pity. Not worth the struggle. </TEXT>

I started getting panic attacks throughout the month and went to the doctor and I was diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety. I was given adderall and anti depressants. I started abusing the adderall because the more I took the happier I felt it gave me a sense of purpose and made me feel normal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there, the last drug I was doing was heroin. I was sick of being miserable and not having money and constantly having to steal and live a life in fear of being arrested. I went to alot of detoxes and rehabs and eventually I gave up trying to run I went through the steps had a year and a half sobriety than I relapsed. I realized the drug wouldn't change anything in my life. I still struggle here and there I have weeks where I feel like shit. But having a crappy day sober is way better than having any day high or drunk for me. I'm 23 and only have my family by my side and a job. I realize I have a problem and its two choices live clean and sober and try to enjoy life. Or use or drink and watch me destroy myself and take my family down while I do it. Oh and I did blow too. Honestly man it isn't easy. Read some books on addiction or living a life finding meaning it will help.  </TEXT>
