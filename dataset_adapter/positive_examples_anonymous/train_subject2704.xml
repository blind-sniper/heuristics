<TEXT> Vet tech here...  
Personal experience, the spay/neuter procedues effect on calming or curbing certain behaviours in dogs varies GREATLY.  That being said it can certainly calm a dog however mostly I've noticed this in dogs that are sterilized before these behaviours start. Sterilizing a 3 year old agressive/bull headed ect ect dog is not going to solve your problem since the behaviour is already sorta set in. Only training can help you. Some dogs (usually males)  will still mark after bekng neutered.  Depends on the dog.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My brother [28/M] has been assaulted by his gf [30/F] this is not the first time. I [27/F] don't know how to talk him into reporting her to the police. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So over the weekend my brother (let's call him C)  was assaulted by his gf for the third time (lets call her B). They were in his car (she was driving) they had two passengers in the back seat. C received a phone call from his friend S.  S is currently at a strip club (to be clear the call is a "face time") so this for some reason sets off B. She grabs his phone and throws or at the car window. I assume she was trying to throw it out the window. After this fit some reason she attacks him. Punches my brother in the face several times, scratches him, tears a piece of his ear off. C manages to escape the car. At this point they were almost at the campfire thing they were going to.  B steals his car and drove off not to be heard from till the next morning. Meanwhile my brother C has run off into the woods. His friend finds him and drives him to my mother's house... So at this point I received a call from my mother and little sister explaining what happened.  My mom takes photos of my brothers face and body (hes bleeding and his clothes are torn) I called the police, however since my brother refused to talk to them and i was not a witness i am apparently powerless to report this crime. After a few hours at my mother's place C goes to his good friends house who happens to be an OPP officer.  (Ontario provincial police).  Over the night i guess his friend has given him advice since C does not wish to report the assault. He gave his gf an ultimatum (move out or he reports her to the police)  problem is i have no idea if he actually said this to B or will even follow through. 

This is not the first time that B has assaulted him. In the past she's hit him before (not this bad) and has smashed a lap top because C would not move a couch at 3am from the curb to the house. (couch her dog destroyed).  And she forbids him from using social media and checks his phone all the time. Any female friends are not allowed ect. I don't really know why C accepts this! I feel like my brother is being manipulated and physically/mentally abused by this psychotic woman. They've been together 4 years and is never really been good between them. 

So what I'm asking basically is, what can i say to my brother that will convince him to reports B to the police? He has 2 witness and photographs. How long does he have to report the assault? 

tl;dr brother been assaulted by his gf for the 3rd time. This time he has witnesses and photographic evidence. How to I get him to report it to the police?  </TEXT>

I woke up one morning cause i could hear him cursing and he was dumping an entire can of arizona fruit punch on his $2000 gaming pc. Safe to say he probably shouldn't be playing online games.  Never did stuff like that unless he was playing with people he couldn't see. So much wasted money on controllers and new ps3's.  Ugh  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to be an avid runner, and by this I mean I used to run 6/7-7/7 days a week. Now its more like 1/7 if that. (boo) I'd really like to get back into running again. Though being that its winter and I really hate the cold its hard for me to get back into running with only the use of the treadmill at the gym. I find it very boring. So I've come to reddit to see how runners here keep motivated in the winter to run indoors. (since for me outside will have to wait till spring) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question] Lowering A Motorcycle. Pros? Cons? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-05 08:58:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone, I've been thinking about lowering my bike recently. I bought it last March and rode it all summer as it was. (standard height) However that being said. I am 5'2 small female and ride a Kawasaki ZX6R 2008. Its quite tall, I have to tip toe on stopping and sometimes it makes me feel really uncomfortable. I know that lowering a bike will change it geometry and make it different while cornering. But say lowering an 1'-.5' would it make a big difference? Or should the bike just be left in stock suspension. Something I've been thinking about for a while. Considered it all summer while I rode it. Though now its off season and I've been thinking about spring a lot and lowering the bike. So whats this community's general consensus. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally i liked twilight princess a lot better. Skyward sword was just bleh. I was super disappointed by the game overall. I think it was annoying having to buy everything and constantly fly around back to the main city. I just came out of the game not liking it at all. All the other ones ive played a million times, that one i probably wont even finish. What I really just don't like is the motion controls. I feel like i'm flailing around. I don't have a wii u yet, but I was hoping that they would mostly do away with that, or at least make an optional control to no have to swing remotes around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't enjoy skyward sword at all. In fact I didn't like it so much I never bothered to finish it.  The controls for swimming I thing irritated me the most about it. And all the other bs that came with it. One of my favourites is MM. I can say I've beaten it more then any other one.  But anyway the point is I think I actually hated skyward sword. Wii controls in general I find too flailey and I find myself disliking the entire motion control system. Just my two cents.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty new to knitting this scarf and the other Gryffindor one I made are my first creations hah...  I believe I used a 16" round needle for the entire scarf. Used a crochet hook to place the tassels. As for the yarn I just picked two colours I liked of the same thickness. I used different thickness for the Gryffindor one than the slytherin same needles though I prefer my scarves to be knitted in the round that way they are double thick with no ugly side c: I can provide the knitting pattern if anyone is interested.  </TEXT>

We clean daily, sometimes more then once, feed multiple times and different ways and provide extra enrichment daily as well all the animals I work with daily are very happy and well cared for.
