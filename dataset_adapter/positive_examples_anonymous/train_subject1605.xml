<TEXT> Its more than that. Greece has a very corrupt system when it comes to paying taxes. Like if I made 100k euro I could pay he tax man x euro to say my income was 25k. This corruption was systemic, it wasn't a lack of work, it was a lack of responsibility. 

Combine that with austerity measures, government officials make less, thus increasing corruption, and reducing tax revenue. </TEXT>

We don't let children make medical or legal decisions, for good reason, they generally don't have the critical thinking skills to make the best choice. So parents make the decision. Yeah, its a shit decision, but legally speaking, they are the ones who have the final say. 

I'm not a JW, and I have no intention to be, but if you want to be the one to take a shit all over the constitution, just try. </TEXT>

People think refined foods are worse because it is easier to over indulge. Refined sugar is no more dangerous *in the appropriate amount* than say pure cane or beet sugar.

It'll taste different, but it is not one the whole more or less healthy than, say, organic alternatives. </TEXT>

Why don't you find a better job? Motherfucker, when I get off work at 8 in the fucking morning after working 32 hours in a span of 56, it isn't exactly easy to go out and do what I need to do. 

Why don't you just stay up and get stuff done during the day? Because if I sacrifice sleep, I sacrifice my ability to do my job well, and thereby risking my literal fucking life.

That's like saying intelligent people shouldn't have a bias towards them because a small group of them ended up head of a despotic dictatorship.

<TEXT> The point is to get people to question what they've been told, why they believe etc. Most people end up believing the religion they grew up in, without truly thinking about what it means. 

And then there are the people who use religion to justify murder, and fuck what those people think. If they want to be irrational asshats, fine, but don't expect me to give any consideration to their feelings. 

What happens when people don't think about what the believe, they become dogmatic and hardliners in getting others to believe, follow, and respect. Extremism begins when you don't allow others to question your beliefs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pay attention to the words I am using, not the context you think is there. Think of this as monotone as you can make it.

the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans.
The company gets a $450 dollar tax credit a year if they spend 1,800 a year paying down an employees debt

The company spends more on paying down student loans, than they would receive in tax credit, which (again) would not encourage hiring of new college grads. This requires businesses to spend more than they receive, which they are not inclined to do.

I think that as a means to an end, it's a bit too complex and likely ineffective. 

Just because it's AN answer doesn't make it the BEST answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're forgetting how much it costs to live. A loaf of bread costs the same for everyone, but it is a larger portion of total income to a poor person. 

There's basically a minimum cost of living if you have a place to live and that cost doesn't necessarily increase the more money you make. If you take 5% of someone making 20k versus 100k, the person making 20k has to make harder choices to cut, as opposed to the 100k person. 

The 100k person can still invest, afford property, play and not have to worry about paying the electric, or rent. the 20k person has much less room to save money, which means they can't take the actions that would allow them to increase their wealth like buying property, investing in retirement or the stock market. 

The point isn't that the person making 2mil doesn't deserve it, the point is that we operate more successfully if more people have the opportunity to make 2 mil. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not familiar with individual tribes and you should get in touch with the tribal council, they deal with these things on a regular basis. 

However, it would really depend on the tribal hospital having a birth record of the grandmother being born to a native. As in on the birth certificate being born to 'this person' who is a tribe member. 

Then the father has to have his birth certificate updated, and then her birth certificate. Its a pain in the ass, and it will take a while, but it can be worth it. 

I'm getting health insurance for $0 co-pay $0 deductible because I have my certificate of native blood. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've seen some good ideas to make war a bit more realistic, and it seems that most revolve around units. I have a few ideas that might change the mechanics of war.

Supply lines. Acts like a trade route to friendly cities that boosts military unit production and maybe city defenses. You could prop a city state to defend itself against another civ or a frontier city. 

Forward operating base. Much like a citadel without the adjacent damage, grants 75% defensive bonus and can be removed. If a supply line is attached it allows you to upgrade adjacent units you control for 33% more gold cost.


Unhappiness. For every 5 military units destroyed or captured in foreign lands unhappiness increases by 1. For every 5 enemy military units captured or destroyed in your land happiness increases by 1. The difference is reduced by one per turn after a peace treaty is signed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on if you have a citizen working that tile after the improvement is completed. Citizen management can be adjusted if you click on the city and look at the drop down menu on the right.

If your city is not well fed, the ai may choose to put a citizen on a farm before hills or a mine. Or, if you have bonuses to tiles that may seem more useful. (Like if you have the sacred path pantheon with give +1 to jungle tiles.) 

Long answer short, yes your worker will likely be produced sooner, but if you want to make sure, citizen management in the the city screen is a good reference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's more the idea that you have taken a pain reliever boosts its perceived ability upwards of half. 

So, if you took a sugar pill and was told it was tylenol or whatever, you would have some reduction in pain. Likewise, if you took a pill and were told it was a sugar pill, the pain reduction would be diminished. 

And this study was for OTC pain relievers, not opioids.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a motorcycle accident when I was 19. I saw her crossing the traffic, I had the right of way, she just pulled in front of me. Nothing I could do. 

I lived in Florida at the time and the only thing that went through my head was "I hope she has insurance." I was wearing my helmet and it's a good thing I was because there's no graceful way to land when you flip head first over and 35 feet past a car. 

Broke my clavicle and needed surgery, its a good thing she had insurance otherwise I would have been fucked for years. FHP at the hospital told me I was lucky, most of the motorcycle accidents he saw were deaths or in so much pain they couldn't answer questions. 

Didn't do the life flashing or regrets, none of that. I like it better that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Example:

The bar I used to work at Served Evan Williams Green Label at $3.50 a drink. Retail A fifth is ~$10.00. IF you get 20 servings from a bottle, 3.50 x 20 = 70. That's a 700% markup. Until you factor in rent, electric, maintenance, labor (and this really depends on location) etc, that bottle is 2-3x as expensive. 

The markup for anything is a significant amount, if you don't include overhead. </TEXT>

Having used these types of drugs, you would have to experience considerable pain before you do major damage to yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had about half a fifth of whiskey and it made sense in the manner that you were saying that coke was responsible for many deaths. 

Though, going back, I understand you were saying that legal amphetamines were responsible for many deaths, and on that I would have to disagree wholesale. The numbers do not suggest that RX amphetamines are killing remarkably large numbers of people. </TEXT>

Bartender comes back a little bit later and since its a pretty slow night, he decides to chit-chat with the customer. After a little bit the bartender asks the man what he does for a living. 

Customer says, "I'm a Center for the Dallas Cowboys."

Bartender replies, "Man, it must be really tough having to do that."

"Its not too bad. I enjoy it"

<TEXT> I know its a bit out of context for a lot of us, however I've been mostly free for a bit now, though I feel lie I'm starting to fall into depression again. (Bi-polar II / manic depressive since I was a kid.) 

Back story; Met a lovely lady a year (around abouts) ago at a mutual friend's birthday party. Nice woman, perhaps a bit drunk, talked a while, facebook friends later. 

Get to talking, she's pretty cool, works in graphic design, responds positively to advances, sexual exchanges including suggestive photographs even though she's in a relationship (I knew) plus she's 13 years older (I'm mature, she's immature). 

We continue talking, life, love, sex all that, advances that she reciprocates to the extent of still being with someone. (Nothing ever happened though it very well could have. Yes, I know. Cheats with you, cheats on you.)

Around her birthday, her BF dumps her, kicks her out, for reasons that she either didn't tell me or he never told her. After a while she agrees to go to lunch with me and then the next week come over and let me make her dinner and watch a movie with drinks. 

Week later, she has to skip dinner because she said she found out he cheated on her and was feeling sick as a result, then tells me later that week she has started seeing someone and that she is confused why I would be upset about this as she told me she couldn't date someone who worked at a bar or who was younger. 

I didn't take this as she thought I would, and that she thought she made that clear before. Back and forth for a few weeks, things said in anger and with inhibition on both sides. 

Anyway, I get past that, ask her how its going, blah blah blah, ask her about her drinking. 

She says she stopped a few weeks ago. (lightbulb) I say good that she stopped drinking so much as it elt like half the times I talked to her she had been. 

And of course, it appears she was. 

Fucking of course, clearly no one could be interested in me unless they were drunk half the time. I don't even know why I try. 

This is more of a rant about the slide of someone with the history of depression than the life of, But, IDFC shit happens. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Slide </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was diagnosed when I was 11. Every step I have taken since has tightened the noose around my neck. High School was easy, living with the possibility of escape in alcohol is difficult. I'm 27. I work as a bouncer in a club. I might be good at it, but the discount on drinks is worth even more. I work 3 nights a week, and the nights I'm off, I spend $40-80 on cheap whiskey. 

Ever wonder what life is like when you have barriers no one will break?

I like to call it The Slide. You know its happening, you know why, but there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.

Do you know what its like to ask for help and the only response you get is silence? Ever wonder what life is like when you ask yourself if you have to kill someone to fucking notice? 

I don't want to die, but what reason do I have to live? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For artists in design, web and general media.

Something the size of a pen that could detect what color something is. You'd put it up to the color you want to 'collect' and you could store like 500 or so colors. Then you could hook it up to a computer and you would see all the different colors you caught and the hex code and the Pantone or other companies info on the color. 

There would be different levels of product- RGB or CMYK; 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 captures; how nice the pen looks (like a nice fountain pen); bluetooth connectivity to your tablet or phone so you can check the color if you'd like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been working on a campaign for a local candidate and I needed to find a way to describe him in a tagline. So I was thinking about it all day Friday and off and on the week prior, and just chilled all weekend. So this morning, I woke up had some breakfast, went outside for my coffee and a smoke and as I'm finishing both, BOOM. 

It's perfect. Simple, progressive, clear, and wraps him in a neat little envelope. 

FUCK YEAH. </TEXT>
