<TITLE> Sensitive lump on cats back after injection. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-29 11:01:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've adopted a cat from a colleague who has never taken her to a vet before. Since I've had the cat, she's been begging to go outside so I bought her an RF collar and took her to the vet to get all her proper shots; Feline Leukaemia Virus and Rabies.

2 days later, the area of the injection site has become very sensitive and she's developed a small lump. I took her back to the vet, administered anti-inflammatories for the next 3 days and applied hot compressions. The swelling and the pain don't appear to be reduced.

The vet said the inflammation should disappear within a few days (and it has a 0.01% chance of being cancerous) and that I should bring her back in a week if the bump hasn't disappeared.

It's been 5 days now and everytime I google the problem, I get hits for Sarcoma. (I had a pet die from vaccine-related sarcoma  a few years ago and I really don't want to jump to conclusions).

Can anyone here offer me an explanation as to why my cat has developed this bump?

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably, theoretically yes.

<TEXT> That is a very fair argument, climate is the long term pattern of weather and meteorologists rely on those patterns and should be able to communicate their findings amongst other scientific communities. 

I find article interesting because the "gag-order" also involves federal employees such as university professors whose research gets funded by the government as well as those climate change scientists who are employed by the federal government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've must've wasted more than 15 pieces of paper trying to wrap my mind around this.

A tank is half full of oil , which has density 920kg/m3. Find the work (in joules) required to pump the oil out of the outlet. Assume g=9.8m/s^2.

The tank is a right circular cylinder and is lying on its side. The radius is 1.5m and the pump extends 1m. The length is 6m.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try [electro-swing.com!](http://electro-swing.com). they have lots of different genres of swing, lengthy dj sets but really awesome tracks!

I like minimal beats too. Beats are suppose to compliment a good swing track, just like salt and pepper are suppose to compliment a good steak. </TEXT>
