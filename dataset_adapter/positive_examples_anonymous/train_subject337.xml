Bf says put it in rice. I don't have rice. Go to store. Now I have rice. Put phone in bag of rice. Four hours later, still no change. Convinced phone is dead. Start looking at getting a replacement from Apple ($300). Leave phone in rice overnight, hoping for a miracle. Next morning, have lost all hope, check phone. Screen lights up. "Charge me!" it cries. Plug into charger. Phone turns on. Works perfectly. We rejoice together as I check my neglected Snapchats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To all those saying the house is shit (read to the end):

Propelling a piece of straw at a palm tree at a distance of 50cm at 320mph (the world record for recorded wind speed at ground level), the straw only managed to penetrate the tree a quarter of an inch. Even firing at the tree while it was bent (to increase the size of the pores in the surface of the tree) at point blank range added no additional distance into the tree. A piece of reed was tested as the sturdiest organic object that might be mistaken for a piece of straw. At both ranges, the reed only managed to go about two inches into the tree. Additionally, Jamie tried a piece of piano wire, and at 50 cm, it flew not only through the tree but through a sheet of plywood on the wall behind it, partially embedding itself into the cement wall.

Make the noodles, strain out most of the water. Then stir in about half of the seasoning packet and toss it with a bunch of lemon pepper. Set it aside.

Cook a can of cream of chicken soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles to your preferred level of soupiness.

Enjoy.

The whole thing costs like a dollar, and takes 15 minutes tops. And it's so delicious." </TEXT>

 I believe hatred gets humanity nowhere.

I agree with this sentiment, but I want to know your thoughts on the obesity epidemic in the States and what it means for the future of humanity. Obviously FPH's goal was not to motivate people to lose weight, but there have been many personal accounts of individuals claiming that FPH was the final kick in the ass they needed to make better lifestyle choices.

I was a daily FPH reader and active poster, and never once saw any encouragement like that of any kind. As far as all of the accusations being made against FPH, I can't think of a single instance to support them. Yes, we're a community of assholes, but that doesn't stop being true when we're offline.

Unfortunately we seem to be in an age where people want to change the world if something hurts their feelings. What happened to people putting on their big boy pants and getting over it? Or considering that maybe they do have a problem that they could fix? We live in a world of adult-sized children. </TEXT>

[&#8220;We will not ban questionable subreddits,&#8221; Reddit&#8217;s CEO, Yishan Wong, wrote in the aftermath of that catastrophe [The Fappening]. &#8220;You choose what to post. You choose what to read. You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce. We will try not to interfere &#8212; not because we don&#8217;t care, but because we care that you make your choices between right and wrong.&#8221;
That echoed Reddit&#8217;s official line on the Violentacrez scandal in 2012: &#8220;We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits.&#8221;](http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/02/20/how-the-reddit-exodus-illustrates-the-state-of-free-speech-on-the-web.html) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Faces were left in, unless it was a minor (which were never posted as the primary focus, but were sometimes in the photo. Their faces were to be blurred or pixelated out.) All other identifying info was washed (name, Tumblr blog URL, Instagram name, etc). No info was left that would have led a reader to the individual's personal or internet existence. This was strictly to *prevent* FPH users going off reddit and trolling someone. It was the opposite, and I'm sharing this in the name of transparency. A more typical scenario is a FPH reader trolling a fat person IRL (Instagram, Facebook, etc) and then anonymously posting about it to FPH, with all identifying info removed. The non-existance of the subreddit won't stop people from posting things on other's Instagram/Tumblr/FB posts; it just takes away the place to share those trollings (if you will).

There was a notable doxxing less than a month ago. Last I followed, the FPH user came close to losing his/her job, and may have since then. All the content from FPH is gone, or I'd share the details for the sake of discussion. </TEXT>

If I go walk up to a person on the street and call them a fat piece of shit is that a direct reflection of my involvement with FPH? If I start an Instagram account just to post shitty things on the HAES pages, does that have anything to do me being a member at FPH? No. It doesn't.

<TEXT> Not bullshit. Active FPH poster here, and you can downvote me to hell for that all you want, but the mods at FPH took this very seriously. We kept to our own little corner of reddit, despite being brigaded ourselves. Despite receiving death threats in our inbox. Despite some members having their lives completely ruined by doxxers. We were constantly being reminded by the mods about the seriousness of our content getting out of the sub. The mods were always quick to remove posts with identifying information, or posts that promoted brigading or activities outside the subreddit.

Basically, all the things that people are accusing us of doing have been happening **to us** and we don't bitch about it. We just stayed in our corner, with our alternate usernames, laughing at pictures of fat people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The amount of that that was going on was nothing. Are they going to ban every sub that has a small percentage of readers brigading elsewhere? It has nothing to do with that.

Case in point: remember when /r/androidmasterrace essentially shut down /r/iosmasterrace due to brigading? The reddit admins did basically nothing. It's not about brigading, and don't think for a second that it's not at least 95% about the fat hate.

Second point: One of the other banned subs is /r/hamplanethatred. I'm a *very* active FPH poster and I'd never even heard of that sub. I doubt they had a big hand in brigading anyone, and certainly not as much as some of the other (non-banned) fat hate subs had the potential to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My best friend and I have shared many moments of hating on fat people. You may have seen some of our snapchat antics over in FPH. Recently it seems his fat hate is softening.

We were at the grocery store last week and saw that issue of People Magazine with queen whale on the cover. It was next to the "Best Bodies Issue" of some other tabloid. I pointed out how I found that extremely funny, and friend asks "why do you hate her so much?" I gave the schpeel about HAES and the FA movement, things he knows about already. He replied with a sentence so wrapped in fat logic I almost walked out of the store and left him there. He said "But it's not affecting you, why do you care?" I about lost it. I can't believe it.

Have you guys had any shitlord friends get soft? What did you do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a question about sleep studies. I had one done a while ago. At the time, I was bartending so my normal sleep hours were between 4am and noon. For the sleep study, they made me get there at 8pm and had me in bed to fall to sleep by 9pm. They said I would be woken up around 6am. I also was forced to sleep on my back, because of the wires, but I'm a tummy sleeper. Needless to say, I didn't fall to sleep for hours. The nurse was frustrated. I was miserable. The study didn't tell the doctor anything relevant. I'm wondering, is this common practice for running a sleep study? How accurate can the results be if they are forcing you to sleep outside of your normal sleeping patterns? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A medley of various Indian animals mating - in domestic and wild conditions...

 In biology, mating is the pairing of opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms for copulation. In social animals, it also includes the raising of their offspring. Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. The two individuals may be of opposite sexes or hermaphroditic, as is the case with, for example, snails.
For animals, mating methods include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes such behaviours as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating domesticated animals and of artificially inseminating them is part of animal husbandry.

 In some terrestrial arthropods, including insects representing basal (primitive) phylogenetic clades, the male deposits spermatozoa on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure. Courtship involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as dragonflies and many spiders, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified sternites on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male pedipalps). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its aedeagus, a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a "spermatophore") into the female's reproductive tract.
Other animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many basal vertebrates. Vertebrates (such as reptiles, some fish, and most birds) reproduce with internal fertilization through cloacal copulation (see also hemipenis), while mammals copulate vaginally.

And then there was a very long list of things like "horses breeding hard" and "dog breeding videos up close" which I can only assume were meant to be keywords and hopefully not insight into the sexual preferences of whomever posted the video. </TEXT>

Once, on the metro, these 4 teenagers were playing some rap songs on a phone, and very loudly rapping all of the lyrics. These were not exactly family-friendly lyrics, and it was after the Cherry Blossom festival, so there were tons of kids on board.

After these teenagers got off the metro, all the adults in the train started talking about it. I've never seen so many complete strangers engaging in one conversation in my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finally got my tragus done today. It was way easier than my cartilage and helix piercings. It hasn't hurt at all since the poke: none of that weird heat or soreness or ache. I've pretty much forgotten that it's there. UNTIL I just put my Apple EarPods in, with the speed and force that I typically do. Holy crap, it hurts now.

You guys with piercings that touch your ear buds, what buds do you use? The hard plastic of the Apple ones is not going to fly while this is healing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm wondering if we will see a trend of violent sociopaths becoming police as a cover. With the news covering nothing but the deaths at the hands of police, it seems like a logical move. I also wonder if maybe that trend has already started, which is why there are so many police acting this way. I find it hard to believe that a typical empath could end a person's life without just cause and be ok with it. This goes a little beyond just an abuse of power. Thoughts? </TEXT>

Through high school, I thought I was really bad at math because I was struggling to understand algebra, and I really didn't care about it. When I got to college and took calculus, I fell in love with it, and every advanced math class after. If they could make primary math as interesting as advanced math I think more people would be good at it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My college roommate was picky about locking the deadbolt. He would leave for the entire summer though, and that was my time to never lock the door. My then-boyfriend needed to get something out of my place one day while I was at work, so I told him to just go over and the door will be unlocked. I get a call from him saying it's locked. I immediately freak out. I check to make sure I don't have my keys on me, maybe I had absentmindedly locked the door or something. But I don't have my keys. In a panic, I leave work and go home. Sure enough, the door is locked. I starting freaking out, thinking there's been a robbery and the culprit was kind enough to lock the door behind him/her, except the interesting thing is that the handle isn't locked (like you can do by locking it while the door is open and then closing the door behind you), but the dead bolt is locked. I text my roommate, thinking maybe he's returned from summer break a few weeks early, but he's in another state. We think maybe the dog jumped up and hit the lock by chance, but ruled that out as the dog is a 15lb Pom with bad hips. So we wait for the maintenance guy to come unlock the door. I go in expecting to walk into the scene of a burglary, but see nothing amiss. My house keys are sitting on the door-side table, where I always leave them. I ask maintenance if they'd been in that day and they say no.

To this day, I still have no idea how the deadbolt got locked, with the only set of keys that could do the deed, locked inside. </TEXT>

Dating in general is nerve-wracking, and meeting a guy off the internet can be very scary, for a million different reasons, some of which are safety related.

I once broke up with a guy I'd been seeing because he casually mentioned that he didn't think mental disorders were a thing. He told me that depressed people just needed positive thinking, and that I was "locking myself into my disorder" because I had accepted that I had it. I'm surprised I didn't punch him. </TEXT>

2) My college psychiatrist kept trying to say I had depression and I was convinced that my moods were perfectly fine. So I sought out a psychologist for a full objective workup and testing.

3) In some ways I'm happy I did it because (after therapy) I became more aware of my actions and why I behave the way I do. In other ways I wish I'd never gotten diagnosed. I was happy just being a shitty person. Now I'm trying way too hard at everything I do, and I'm putting way too much effort into trying to be a normal functioning member of society.

If I was a better person I'd know how to help him, but for now all I can think to do is be someone he feels comfortable talking to. I'd like for him to be able to come to me if he's struggling with certain dark thoughts, or having trouble dealing with our mother. I told him "take it from me; I survived that shithole and got out." I've also already invited him to come stay with me the summer between high school and college, just to get him out of that house even sooner.

<TEXT> You're mistaking reddit for the internet. Of course there are dark corners of the web, but that's less than 1% of the every-day user base. Way to go on making a moot point.

The fat people on The Biggest Loser aren't being wildly accepted. Otherwise it would be called The Biggest People Who Aren't Going To Lose Weight. That show is literally trying to make these people not fat anymore, and does do through lots of fat shaming and generally making these people feel like absolute shit about their body.

I see you've given up on arguing the original point at hand, and have resorted to dissecting the intricacies of part of what I say, rather than understanding the broader point.

Good day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here we go.

Like what others are saying. Being fat is something a person can control. You can't control being a certain race. While you can control being a certain religion (to an arguable extent not fit for right here), it's not unhealthy to be one versus another; it's a personal preference.

I'm against people who are trying to convince the public that fat is perfectly healthy. It's setting a despicable standard, and they are arguing against decades, if not centuries, of medical research. By trying to save the feelings of people who make poor life choices, society is enabling them to continue to make those choices.

Think about smokers. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you. Everyone knows that it causes cancer and lung disease and all kinds of nasty things. But you don't see a group of smokers trying to tell the public that it's perfectly healthy, just because someone said they were gross for being a smoker. You don't see them saying "I'm perfectly healthy *right now* therefor it must be a healthy lifestyle choice." But you see obese people saying "I'm perfectly healthy *right now* therefor my obesity must not be a health issue."

Do you get it now? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thought I'd share. I have a friend from high school with whom I've stayed close (we're 25 now). We hadn't seen each other in a while because I moved away a couple years ago, but I was in town recently and we met for dinner. She recently got divorced and told me that it happened while her and the husband were trying to conceive. So we got on the topic of kids. She's definitely a mother person. I'm wholly surprised she hasn't yet popped any out. But I told her I was firm in not wanting kids, and she was so accepting of that. She even went on to say she couldn't even picture me with kids. Made me so happy. It's unusual to have a parenting-type person understand the desire to have a career without a family, especially at the age I am now.

I hope all of you have a friend like that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My kid brother seems to be doomed too </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey r/soc. Haven't visited in a while, but wanted to get some discussion and see what you all think.

My kid brother is 14 and he's showing signs of developing ASPD. Our mother is textbook narcissistic, and it seems like she's perceiving him as the golden child where I was the scapegoat (look up your NPD parenting types). If you're too lazy to look it up, imagine the (very extreme) family relationships in Bates Motel. Norman = golden child, his older brother = scapegoat. Both ones will fuck a kid up.

I was visiting recently, and I've been very open with him because I'm trying to educate and spare him. But he asked me things about killing people and how hard it would be emotionally. I gave him some resources (r/watchpeopledie, etc) to look at and see what he thinks/feels. He's already super apathetic, doesn't really care about anything. He doesn't get in trouble but he's also almost completely unsupervised. He's kind of doing the dance of "I'm going to do what my parents say just so they stop bitching at me" and then finds shortcuts around it to appease them. He doesn't have a lot of friends, very very introverted.

Some more stuff that is most likely just 14 year old boy stuff, but possibly worth mentioning: He says he's not smoking weed, but I'm not sure I believe him. He sneaks out of the house in the middle of the night and goes god only knows where. My parents live in the middle of fucking nowhere. He's a very convincible liar. His grades are going down, even though he's brilliant.

Not looking for an is he / isn't he discussion. He still has a few years before that's determinable. Just general talk. What do you guys think? How were you when you were 14? I was presenting differently at 14 and also much earlier than 14 (started showing signs around age 9sih; I'm 25 now). I was more of a liar/manipulator/conduct problem kid. I'm female, so not sure if that makes a difference in symptom presentation (not yet enough research done there). </TEXT>

Also, with the Health app (on iPhones, I don't know if Android has an equivalent), if I record a workout on the Carrot workout app, or with one of my other workout apps (NikeRun, Fitnet, etc), it automatically puts the calories burned into my Carrot calorie counting app. Makes life a lot simpler.

Make the noodles, strain out most of the water. Then stir in about half of the seasoning packet and toss it with a bunch of lemon pepper. Set it aside.

Cook a can of cream of chicken soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles to your preferred level of soupiness.

Enjoy.

The whole thing costs like a dollar, and takes 15 minutes tops. And it's so delicious. </TEXT>

OP's picture is more like how it was when I was in school here many years ago. "Oh, we might get some snow at some point. CLOSE THE SCHOOLS!!"

<TEXT> This. I used to work at a supermarket bakery and every day we would throw out food that had hit it's "Sell By" date. It was all cakes and bread loaves and bagels and the likes. This food was still good to be eaten for days. I tried to get the store to donate it to the homeless or shelters, and they said it was a health liability thing. I could see the issue being the same or similar for people who root it out the dumpster.

Didn't stop me from taking a bunch of that food home though. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He moved away a week ago. Since then, we've had one phone call that lasted about 10 minutes. I get maybe 1 text from him a day, if even that. I mentioned today that I've barely heard from him. He says he's been busy. I tell him it would be nice to hear from him more than once a week. I explain that I don't need to talk to him every single day, but I don't want us to become strangers because we never talk. We agreed to talk about it more tomorrow on the phone, as he's with his friends tonight.

It's only been a week and we're already fighting about the distance. If I'm going to only get to talk to him once a week, that's not enough for me. I know myself, and I know I need more than that. I'm hoping we can find a compromise. I'm hoping he has a good explanation.

Did anyone else experience this at the beginning? Is this a red flag for later on? Before he moved he had this attitude of "we'll make it" and "don't worry, we'll be fine" and all that. Now it's like he doesn't think that's the case anymore. If he cared and wanted it to work, wouldn't he be putting in more effort? He says he's been busy with his friends. Can't he find 15 minutes to get away and call me, or 30 seconds to send me a text message? Why am I feeling less important than the people he sees every day? I'm starting to think maybe he's not as serious about it.

I'm suppose to drive up to see him this coming Friday. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, your post is making me tear up, because your situation sounds extremely similar to the one my boyfriend and I have just thrown ourselves into. We weren't together for as long beforehand, but he moved away as a career move and I stay here for mine. We are both extremely career oriented people and this is just how it has to be right now. I have too much going on here to be able to move right now, and he needs to be in a different location for his job. We're also about the same distance away as you and yours (about 4.5 hours), so saying that you get to see him nearly every other weekend makes me happy.

But the thing that really got me is your bullet point 4. SO said something like this to me the other day, before he left. He said that we're both such ambitious people that we have the potential to be an amazing power couple one day. But we have to work on getting there first. And if that means being apart and still together, then so be it. It's a bittersweet thing.

Thank you for the feels. I'm on day 1 of my LDR, so your post was very encouraging for me. </TEXT>

And I just happen to like my body better when it's in-shape and looking healthy. Everyone should always strive to have the body they want, regardless of what that body type is. Be happy in your own skin. I'm happiest when I'm slender.

I don't see what's shallow about wanting my own body or appearance to be a certain way. I'm saying nothing about how I prefer anyone else's body. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Getting my first quadcopter for Christmas </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-22 18:51:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all! I've been thinking about getting into flying for a while. I've lurked on this sub a bit, and watched plenty of YouTube videos with various copters, and learned about the parts of them and all that jazz. I decided to (kind of) take the plunge and asked for a quadcopter for Christmas. Well, I found out that I'm getting a Syma X5C. So I'm wondering, did you all start out by learning on a smaller, less expensive copter? How long before you felt you were ready to invest in a nicer one? How hard is it to actually get good at flying? Any wisdom you have to share with someone who's never flown anything remote control before?

Thanks!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a feeling I'm about to be a more frequent poster in this sub.

First of all, thank you to all of you who offered kind words and encouragement on my last post. Yesterday was the day. He left my apartment and I immediately called my best friend who came over with wine and Christmas movies, which was awesome.

I feel like crying and throwing up. I barely slept last night, my appetite is all but gone, and I'm still doubting that I can even do the long distance thing. SO is so confident that everything will be fine and we'll make it, so I'm hoping his confidence will rub off on me in time, and I'll gain some better faith in myself.

I think what worries me the most is that the move is indefinite. I have a career where I am now, and he has no plans for returning. He's starting a career in this new location. How is it suppose to work if we have no plan of being reunited at some point in the future? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bf is moving away this weekend. We haven't been together long, almost two months, but we've talked about it and we want to try to make it work. He's also not moving very far away, only about 4 hours. I've been pretending it's not happening and then this evening the whole thing just hit me like a bag of bricks and I broke down. I've never been in a LDR before and I have no idea how I'm going to deal with this. I don't know how I'm going to balance my life here with him being away. I feel like I'm going to lose all my friends because I'll be trying to visit him every weekend I can, or if he comes here I won't want to see anyone else. To me right now, it feels like a breakup. My best friend keeps telling me it will all be ok. Bf keeps reassuring me that we'll be fine, and I know deep down that we will be. I just don't know how, or how hard it's actually going to be to make it work.

Sorry I'm kind of venting right now, and my thoughts are all jumbled. I just needed to get this out and hopefully gain some insight into what I can expect, and maybe some advice to help me stop freaking out.

Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [REQ] $300 to sign the lease of a last minute apartment change. Pay back $350 from my Dec 16th paycheck. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-10 20:13:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi. I originally was planning to move in with roommates who already had an apartment secure and I wouldn't have to pay a deposit. But, I found a different apartment that is worlds better for me to live in (less rent, no roommates, only a block from work, etc). I need to sign the lease by the end of this week, but I don't get paid until Tuesday the 16th. Normally it wouldn't be an issue as I make a decent amount of money, but with Thanksgiving, my last paycheck was only half of what it normally is.

I will pay back as soon as my Dec 16th check goes in direct deposit (9am on the 16th), $350 or whatever amount is deemed appropriate. At this point, getting this apartment secured is more important than the money.

I'm in Blacksburg, VA, USA. I don't know how the members of this sub handle money transfers as this is my first time here, but I'd be willing to pay for overnight mailing of a money order, or whatever else is easiest.

Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> &#8220;Three of the four elements are shared by all creatures, but fire was a gift to humans alone. Smoking cigarettes is as intimate as we can become with fire without immediate excruciation. Every smoker is an embodiment of Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and bringing it on back home. We smoke to capture the power of the sun, to pacify Hell, to identify with the primordial spark, to feed on them arrow of the volcano. It's not the tobacco we're after but the fire. When we smoke, we are performing a version of the fire dance, a ritual as ancient as lightning.&#8221;

<TEXT> I was a 17 year old girl at one point in my life. What the top commenters are saying about trying to talk to her about it without being too harsh or threatening to punish sounds like it would be the most effective. I'm sure most of us can remember a time when we were in our late teens and our parents trying to punish us was more of a joke than anything else. At 17, she's nearly an adult, and while she will obviously still be under your rules at home, she will see herself as and want to be treated as an adult. You also sound like you understand that concept of letting her form into her own person as well and I commend you for that. Remind her that she could end up in serious trouble if she's doing illegal things. It sounds like she's a smart kid with good schooling and possibly college aspirations so a firm reminder about not messing that up could potentially go a long way. </TEXT>

Dated a guy once for about two months who told me he had a propensity for sticking his dick in crazy, and I was thinking, "ok, well I'm relatively normal, so it should be good." Nope. He turned out to be the most arrogant, self-centered person I'd ever met and it was simply impossible to please him. Any opinion or idea that differed from his was considered "crazy". Dropped that like a hot potato. Ended with me telling him "maybe you're the problem." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Moves. It's tracks your movement in the background and tells you how many steps you've walked, run, cycled, and driven. Works both with internal accelerometer and GPS, so it works just as well walking around town as it does on the treadmill. It gives you a map of all the places you went and you can tag them (it recognizes businesses, and you can save your home, work, etc). It's nice to see at the end of the day what my normal activity was. I went to an amusement park a few weeks ago and found that I walked a total of 7 miles just walking around the park. It's also very helpful when you were drunk downtown the night before and don't remember which bar you left your tab open at.

<TEXT> Totally agree with all of this. I pay the $10 for Spotify Premium because it gives me access to 99.9% of the songs I would want to listen to, on my phone at all times. It allows me to not have to load my 30+ GB of music onto my phone too, so it's a major storage saver.

Also, the premade Spotify playlists are on point, and the radio is way better than Pandora IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a developer but I need a second one. The issue where I am is that the companies can't even find developers to work for salary, so finding someone who will reliably work for free or even pay into a startup is next to impossible. My area is full of investors and coworking spaces and everything else a startup would need to succeed, but extremely lacking in people wanting to join startups.

I know what you mean though with business people looking for devs for their ideas though. I had someone hit me up once with his idea, which I though was good but not interesting to me personally, but he pretty much asked me to build the whole thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all. I'm new to this sub. Someone over in /r/sociopath said I should check it out. I am 100% convinced my mother has NPD; I won't go into the details this time. As a result, I've been diagnosed and stuck with ASPD.

My question is related to getting her the help she needs. I'm in my 20s and have been on my own for years now, so I can just ignore her, but I worry about my kid brother. He's 14 and he's already starting to show the traits for ASPD or other empathy-based personality disorders, and I'm convinced it's because of him growing up with our mother. I don't want to see that happen to him.

Has anyone been successful in getting help for their narcissistic parents? Unfortunately, she's been successful in turning most of the family against anything I have to say, and my diagnosis reinforced that within my family. I'm unsure of how to bring it up with any family members without them telling me I'm crazy or overreacting or something of the sorts. I just really want her to get better so she doesn't fuck up my brother for life. </TEXT>

I can imagine this is happening in every town all over the country. Thanks OP for the post and raising awareness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for doing this! I was actually in Harry Potter World in Florida over the weekend, so coming home to an AMA by you is great!

So many questions for you already, I hope you get to mine.

Harry Potter was such an integral part of my growing up, and I'm among the many many 20-somethings that followed the series from the first three books and on. As a fan, when the credits rolled on the Deathly Hollows Part 2, the feeling of "it's all over" was overwhelming. How was it for you when the last movie was finished and the series came to an end? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not trolling, and way to only discount a portion of what I said. At the time this article was written, the CDC was still saying we weren't going to get it in the US at all. The operative phrase in your post is "so far". Just one confirmed case is still a start to them happening more and more here. Ebola has an average infection rate of 3 people per infected person, and with an incubation period of up to 21 days, the possibilities are at least mildly troubling.

In a fast-building story like the Ebola coverage is, an article published two weeks ago, let alone two months ago, like this one, is irrelevant.

Do your research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just drove home from an extremely exhausting weekend event. This was suppose to be a four hour drive, and it turned into nearly six and a half, with no stops and no traffic.

I get on the highway to go home, heading south. About 45 minutes in there is a junction and I can either take I-64 East or I-64 West. In my exhausted state, it somehow makes sense for me to go east. I'll note here that I live in southwest VA. So I'm driving along and I see a sign that tells me VA Beach is around 65 miles away or something like that. That should have been my first clue. But instead of wondering why I'm being told how far away VA Beach is when I'm suppose to be traveling away from it, I think "Oh cool I'm close to VA Beach, maybe I'll stop there!" And I keep driving. **For an hour.** Finally, I see a sign about the infamous bridge-tunnel, and that's when the red flags start going up in my head. I very slowly realized my mistake. It was not a good realization. I was already exhausted and just wanted to be home, and I'd just added two hours, at least, to my trip. Also wasted a quarter tank of gas. I angrily turned around and made my way home.

tl;dr Went the wrong direction on the highway, didn't realize for an hour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually become suspicious of somewhen when I notice their reactions to things. I think a huge tell (and one that's really hard for me to fake) is the reaction to a bad situation. Example: my friend left my apt the other night, I immediately got into bed because I was exhausted. Friend knocks on door and says car has been towed. I'm just like "well that sucks. Goodnight". I assume normal people would want to help or something. I got called out on that. So if I see someone have a reaction like that when they should be more engaged, it throws a flag. Then I observe their other behavior and figure out if I think they are part of the 1% or if they just have trouble dealing with certain situations.

Also ITT: "let's argue about how many psychopaths we may or may not come in contact with." C'mon guys, we've been doing so well lately. The reality of it is this: the best guess that science can give is that 1% of the population suffers from some severity of ASPD. That's 1 in 100 people. In a typical day you will probably come into contact with more than 100 people, assuming you do things like go to lunch at a restaurant or work in a building with other people or walk around a college campus, etc. I think the more valid point is that you don't directly interact with over 100 people a day. So while the likelihood of you being in close proximity with a psychopath is not terribly low, the chances of you actually befriending one is slim. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all. New to the sub. I've never actually been involved in any migraine help community and I don't actually know anyone else who is afflicted.

I've been having weekly migraines since I was a teenager. I read a lot about going into a dark, quiet room and laying down, but that never seems to make a difference. I noticed a while back though that I seem to be temperature sensitive. During the migraine, I go through hot and cold changes. One minute I'll be burning up and having cold sweats and then the next I'll be shivering, like the cold is coming from the inside and no amount of sweatshirt or blanket can make me warm..

Also, laying down makes everything worse. I find that the pain is most manageable when I'm standing or walking around. I spend a lot of time pacing the floor.

Do these things happen to anyone else? Any opinions or tales from experience? Dunno if it's helpful or not, but I'm on sumatriptan 50mg. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Solve my medical mystery! My doctor has run out of options. Eustatian tube issues, maybe? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-16 22:31:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's the background: for as long as I can remember (at least as young as 10 years old) my ears have felt clogged up. I try to yawn or move my jaw around or hold my nose while blowing to try and get them to pop, but they won't. Sometimes I have autophony. When I try to make them pop, I just hear some crackling, like they're trying to, but the pressure won't equalize. I can't go under 5-6 feet of water without it being excruciating because the pressure won't equalize. Oddly, I have zero problems with flying. It's extremely uncomfortable and I just want my ears to be normal. I've had hearing tests done and I have no loss of hearing. They've tested the pressure behind my eardrum and found it to be normal.

I've been to 4 ENTs. The first 2 told me I had allergies and told me to take daily Claritin and stay indoors. Tried daily allergy meds for a few months with no change. Staying indoors is not an option. I've never had allergy problems in my life, but I was willing to give anything a go. After that didn't work, ENT told me I would just have to live with it. Third ENT told me the same thing.

Fourth ENT was the first to actually try real solutions, and even though he couldn't fix me, I still thank him enormously for trying. He put me on two months of steroid nasal spray. When that did nothing, we decided to undergo the placement of tubes in my ears. I had that surgery three weeks ago. There is still no change. At my follow-up yesterday he has now told me there's nothing else to be done. He says sometimes the nerves send a signal of fullness to the brain so that it feels congested when it's really not. I can't accept this, because then the water depth wouldn't be an issue and I wouldn't get that crackling sound when I move my jaw around. Also, the autophony probably would not be an issue if it was just pesky nerves.

reddit, there must be something to be done. The congestion makes me want to stab holes in the side of my face as if that would help relieve it, and it feels like this all day, every day, for the past 15 years at least. I will answer any questions that may help solve this mystery.

Please help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use the two-finger trackpad gesture to go to the previous web page (quick for looking at pictures and such). Worked fine for the three weeks I've had this laptop. Installed RES 10 minutes ago and now it's not working. It causes Safari to freeze the current web page. The program itself works fine, other tabs that are open are not affected, but the tab that I'm in to try to swipe back freezes, regardless of if it is reddit or not. When it freezes, it moves maybe 10 pixels to the right, as if it's started to swipe back, and then sticks there and becomes unresponsive. I'm unable to open a new tab or navigate away from the current page. If it's the only tab open I have to restart Safari. I am able to close out of the affected tab.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My boss has tasked me with doing video editing, and seeing as I'm a programmer, I have zero clue about what I'm doing. I've watched enough YouTube tutorials to know how the software works, but now I'm getting into the content and I'm lost.

There is around 30 minutes of work-out video and I need to cut it down to a 30-ish second preview. There is only one camera angle, and it's relatively wide. I have no control over filming; I just get the finished videos handed to me from above.

There are over 20 series' I need to do this for. I'm using iMovie 10.0.3 on a MacBook Air.

What should I be looking to pull into a preview? Just playing around with the first series I managed 23 seconds, including a 4 second title. I just took a few seconds here and there showing different movements and with the trainer saying motivating or explanatory things, and crossfaded them together. Now I'm stuck on how to end it, and I really don't think the current 23 seconds that I have is any good. This is content that will be pushed to clients, so I need it to be at least halfway decent.

Everything I find by doing a Google search relates to movie editing and things with different camera angles and lots of dialogue and none of it is relevant. Any tips or advice is much needed and greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been a few embedded discussions here recently relating to the difference between men and women with ASPD. I've been doing some reading in a few psych medical journals to try and find some concrete research on it, but the majority of the studies use prison inmates. I have found that the current statistics are estimated at there being 1 woman diagnosed for every 3 men.

Has anyone done any research you can share? Or what have you guys observed if you know any ASPD people of the opposite gender? I know we have at least one other active female member on here who I'd like to hear from.

Edit** More info

I posted this over in /r/psychotherapy as well, to see what the therapists and psychology professionals had to contribute. One person said he/she noticed that men usually acted alone, where women usually had an equally antisocial male counterpart. Found that interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I ask because I went to VA Tech and today is the 7th anniversary of the shooting. I went to high school with the shooter and two of the girls who were killed, one of which I knew decently. Because of those things, I always have some semblance of an emotional response to this day, although I can't figure out what it is. Sadness maybe? Remnants of what that day was like? I don't know. My emotional palate is small. Regardless, it's a day I stay away from people because everyone is emotional and doing that whole "we're part of something greater" community thing and I can't stand it. Some people a few years ago wanted me to go to the candlelight vigil at midnight, so I did. I spent the whole time reading everyone else's faces. It was people-watching gold.

I also have the unpopular opinion that 33 Hokies died that day, because I include the shooter in the death count. I said this to one person, once, and will never make that mistake again.

But other shootings and violent acts/natural disasters, I don't feel anything for at all. Boston Marathon, Sandy Hook, hurricanes destroying cities, etc. I have that attitude of, "well, that happened" and I barely give it a second thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a very small, old dog. I've found that I can just feed it and walk it and it doesn't require any attention other than that because he just lazes around the house all day. It's nice because he's barely there, so I haven't had an opportunity to really get bored with it, and he doesn't bother me. It's like having a moving piece of furniture that I have to buy food for.

It should be noted I suppose that I haven't had the desire to harm animals since I was young. People, yes, but I like animals. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting having unintentional LD. Pretty freaked out by it. Need some feedback. </TITLE>

<TEXT> These are happening naturally.

My first one was about a month ago. I was drifting off, and then my body felt like it was buzzing. It got so intense I could hardly stand it. I assume I entered the dream state at some point while the buzzing was going on because all at once the buzzing stopped and I was floating off of my bed, toward the ceiling. I know it wasn't an OBE because I looked down at the bed and my body wasn't there. I floated until I bumped into the ceiling. I was terrified and mustered all of my strength and screamed, which took me out of the dream. My roommate later told me that he'd heard me scream. I was so scared by what had happened that I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. Instead, I stayed up and researched as much as I could about lucid dreaming.

I was afraid to have another one through the following nights, but enough time passed that I stopped worrying about it, and I wrote it off as a one-time freak occurrence.

Until last night. I was drifting off and felt the buzzing again. Instead of being scared I tried to focus on it. Next I knew, I was floating around and out of my (closed) bedroom window. I dreamed I was exploring a little historical town. I was playing around with running and floating, and just controlling myself in general. The dream was so vivid. Normal dreams for me are blurry, or hazy, but this one was crystal clear, like I was really there on a bright sunny day. I could look around and go where I wanted. It was devoid of other people tho, or any action. It was just a little empty town, and me learning how to control my dream self.

I also noticed that I was aware of what my physical body was doing. I realized in the dream that I could float if I got a running start and kicked my legs, like swimming. I could feel my physical body moving my legs while I was doing that. Or if I turned my head to look at something, I knew my actual head was turning too. It almost felt like a part of me was caught between asleep and awake.

It lasted maybe ten minutes. I came out of it suddenly when I heard someone whisper "hey" in my ear and it sounded like it was whispered into my actual ear, and not my dream-self ear. (Note that I sleep alone.)

I'm very freaked out by the whole experience. I have done some research and looked through r/luciddreaming and noticed that a lot of you do this intentionally. Is it uncommon for it to happen naturally? Any advice as far as controlling it or dealing with it? Is my experience in line with a typical lucid dream? It's a frightening experience for me and any words of wisdom are appreciated.

tl;dr: Started having LD naturally. Freaked out. Help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Making a mock business website to add to my "I'm new to web dev" portfolio and my positioning is making me want to put my head through my computer screen.

Can someone please offer some insight as to why the positioning is off and ways to correct the issue?

Open it in safari (if you have it) and chrome or firefox. In safari it looks like it should. The row of three pictures are horizontally inline with each other.
