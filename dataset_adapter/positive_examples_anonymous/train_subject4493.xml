<TEXT> Coming off of them was hell because you quit cold turkey. I did this a few times with SSRIs - I don't know why. My depressed brain convinced myself to quit each time. And each time I felt more depressed. 

Have you discussed these worries with your psychiatrist? They should be able to talk you through the details. Also, I have found that a little bit of medication gave me the motivation to help myself. It gave me a little boost.

Just be smart about your meds. Take it according to the prescription and notify your doctor if you want to adjust dosages or come off of it - and do it, slowly. 

Also, I find it's good to have a buddy to take the role of encouraging you with your meds. I always got to this point where I said the meds aren't working, this is stupid, I'm done taking these. So I enlisted the help of a friend to remind me to take them and to tell me it's good for me. Now I've been on them for about 8 months and my life is so much better. 

Please discuss these concerns you have with the psychiatrist. I do not believe you are in a rut because of the meds you previously took. It is probably due to the stress you have been under, and that's okay. The medication will help you be able to help yourself. 

Good luck! Stick with it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I had a moment of clarity after experiencing pretty bad (but temporary) panic. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-16 02:52:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just started an internship this summer, which has been pretty huge for me. A year and a half ago I was pretty much bedridden. I would panic walking down the street. 

Anyway, I got on an SSRI, got back into school, and somehow found my way into a really great internship program. I get very anxious in new situations around new people, so it's been rough trying to adapt. 

Well, today was a sort of breaking point. I have developed some sort of claustrophobia and of course, I pick a job where I occasionally need to work in the company data center. Unfortunately this is in a highly secured room so I need an escort, and it's in a basement area. For some reason when I can't see windows or the outside, I get very, very nervous. 

So, I really panicked. I felt like I was going to pass out. My face was bright red, I was sweaty, I felt cold and hot all at once, my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn't breathe. This lasted probably 20 minutes, on and off. Sort of like waves of panic and anxiety. At a certain point I think my body was exhausted. I couldn't really panic anymore, I didn't have the energy to do it. I had this moment of clarity...I CAN handle anxiety. I can manage it, even in front of people. I didn't have to leave the space I was in. I just rode it out, and eventually my panic subsided. 

I don't really like the advice to focus on your breathing to calm yourself. This always made me feel worse and feel like I was hyperventilating. I think the best thing for me is to just say, well, this is temporary. It will eventually go away regardless of what you do. 

I'm writing this for anyone who has work anxiety. My anxiety is the worst when I'm in a space I am socially expected to stay in - like meetings, for example. Or even when I'm out with people at a restaurant. I still don't go to movie theaters because I simply can't sit still or focus on the movie. 

I like to think of it as if I'm forcing my body to stay in a certain situation to prove to it that it is NOT life threatening. I get nervous and want to run - like in a meeting - but I force my body to sit still. Yeah, I fidget a lot, move my hands, whatever. But it's a start. 

So I guess what I mean by this is it's good for me to feel the anxiety because I can convince my body to finally relax. I just wanted to share that with you guys!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depression is such a mystery to me sometimes. There are days where I feel amazing, and then days where I feel so horrible I don't know what to do with myself. I have to remind myself that I have progressed. 

I wouldn't consider it a battle against yourself. Your depression is certainly a part of your life but it doesn't define you. It's a battle against your depression - which can feel like losing an uphill battle. 

What I think I'm going to start doing is making a jar where each day I write something positive about myself and about my life. Something small, like, I enjoyed the beautiful weather today. Depression makes us pick out the negative in our lives so that we forget the positive things. Then, when I'm feeling depressed, I'll read through these and try to remember how I felt when I wrote them down. I'm hoping that will help me get through bad times.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure! I'm taking 50mg of sertraline which is a fairly low dose. I started out at 25mg, they increased me to 50mg and I started seeing improvements. I started on medication and decided to stick with it because I wanted to pass my semester. I had previously dropped out of school and I really wanted to finish my degree. I experience a lot of classroom anxiety so I would avoid going to class. On the sertraline, boom, anxiety in the classroom gone. It took me about 3 months to get to that point - so give your medication time to work.

I had no weight gain on the medication at all. In fact, it has probably helped my eating habits because I used to binge eat when I was very depressed. I have since stopped doing that. 

The side effects I do experience are issues acheiving orgasm. Possible TMI but last time I attempted an orgasm it took me 45 minutes! I still experience sexual satisfaction with my partner but I have just accepted that it will be more difficult for me now. I also experienced mild nausea when I first started taking the pills but that went away within a week. 

My advice - stick with it. SSRIs need a few months to kick in. But they gave me that little boost. I still struggle with depression - it isn't a magic cure all - but it seriously helped me. Go with what your doctor recommends. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do sigh a little every time I see the advice of "volunteer." It's so common when people are depressed. The idea is that if you have people who rely on you, you will build self-esteem and confidence. What happened to me, is I volunteered to teach English as a second language. I had to go into someone's home and help them with English. It was a really stressful situation. I had a lot of anxiety and I ended up quitting it because it made me feel guilty all the time!

It's not bad advice, but it's not the depression cure all people want it to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do you think you will ruin someone else's happiness? 

I think that feeling is probably a reflection of what your mom has taught you - that you somehow affect her feelings (i.e. your depression makes her feel unhappy so it must be your fault).

It's not healthy to think that way, and it probably contributing to a lot of your depression. If you haven't looked into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) I would google it. One of the main concepts of CBT is that we process events and our brain decides how to respond to it. Do you notice how certain people respond differently to events? For example, say you did poorly on a test. I might respond by thinking that I'm a failure. This thought leads to feeling very depressed. This leads to me avoiding that class, subsequently doing worse and worse and confirming my belief that I'm a failure.

Now, take someone else who is maybe more positive. They do poorly on the test. They say, well, it was really hard and I didn't study as much as I should have. So they think, it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a failure. I just need to study more. So they keep going to class, take good notes, and study for the next test, and do well. Do you see where I'm going with this?

In the case of your mom, she reacts to the event of you being depressed or unhappy. She thinks, what happened to my happy boy? She probably thinks, maybe it's my fault he feels this way. I must be a terrible mother. These thoughts make her feel awful and depressed. She thinks, if only he was happy, I would be happy too. He's making me unhappy. 

BUT, if you look at this situation, SHE made herself unhappy by these thoughts. Not you. It's important to remember that. Don't let others make YOU feel like YOU made them feel a certain way. That was a big breaking point in my depression. It made me relax a bit. If someone is upset, that's their problem, not mine. I can't fix it. I didn't make them upset. 

If possible, I would look into therapy. If you can't afford therapy or don't want to, look into books on CBT. I like Feeling Good. I look at it from time to time. You can't change your family and how they react to you, but you can change how YOU react to what they say. You don't need to feel guilty for your depression because you did not choose to have it. 

I am on an SSRI and I have found that incredibly helpful. You can see a primary care physician and they will usually prescribe you an SSRI. If you're open to medication I would look into it! 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, do you want to go out and do things? I guess it would be helpful to figure out why you don't want to. My reasons for not doing things is because I assumed something negative would happen or I wouldn't enjoy myself. I really just had to lower my expectations or try to find something positive about the experience. I really don't like going out to restaurants with other people - it makes me feel very anxious and typically I feel like I can't eat anything. But I try to focus on when I *did* enjoy going out. What did I like about it? I liked talking with others and figuring out who they are. I liked talking about movies and books. Sometimes I just have to pretend. 

A lot of the time, even after going out, I have to force myself to think of something positive. I think a lot of my problem is 1, anticipatory anxiety of the event, which leads to 2, experiencing anxiety during the event, which leads to 3, viewing the event as negative and confirming that I just should not go out and I will never enjoy it. 

Accepting you may not like to go outside and it might not be fun, I think, makes it easier. When I was younger I used to have the persona of the negative, angry one of the group. I would be sarcastic and make jokes. I think this was a self-defense mechanism I was using because I was anxious. By joking around and being sarcastic, and being negative about being out, made it much easier to enjoy myself. 

As far as tactics, it really depends on what it is. I find that sitting and meditating for 10-20 minutes has helped my overall anxiety and ability to adapt to certain situations. I have created a sort of imaginary place of relaxation in my head. No one else can get there, and it's very green, sunny, but shaded with trees, and I imagine myself floating down a small river by canoe. I always imagine this scenario in any case where I am stressed out. I think bringing back this image over and over again strengthens it's relaxation response in my head. So, it might be worth a try. 

Another thing would be to forgive yourself if you don't want to go out. You don't HAVE to. I remember I told my therapist I was worried because I didn't have many friends. He said, why do you need friends? Well, I would feel normal if I had a lot of friends. We worked on it and I realized, I don't have a lot of friends because I simply don't want a lot of friends. I'm fine with my family and my SO and my pets. I wasn't trying to get more friends because I wanted it, it was because I felt like maybe I would more mentally normal if I did. 

Another thing would be simply repetition to get your mind used to going out. What kinds of things did you used to enjoy? Shopping? Going to restaurants? Going for a walk? Do those things a few times a week. Don't have any expectations. Allow yourself to hate it if you want. I find that the more I do something, the more and more I am comfortable with it. I might not love it. But I don't experience anxiety after a while. 

I hope that makes sense! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well you have a bunch of options too if you didn't learn much in college. You could learn a trade, apply for a different type of job - a lot of places only require a bachelor's degree and you can pretty easily get into another career, you could go for a totally different degree, get a master's, or join the military! Just know that with the military, you're stuck there for 4 years. I know my ex loved the brotherhood aspect. He really missed it when he got out. He had ADD so it was a good environment for him. 

That's pretty awkward about your mom saying what happened to her "happy boy." She sounds a bit self-centered. Maybe she's trying to guilt you into feeling better by telling you those things. Maybe she blames herself a bit too for how you feel, and is acting out because of that. 

What does your dad say? Do you have another relative you can talk to? I know when I was going through my divorce I could NOT talk to my mom at all about it. She had zero sympathy for me and was really mean, so I started talking to my aunt. She was a lot better to talk to and she let me vent without judging me. My ex cheated on me and my mom would find a way to tell me it was MY fault because I didn't choose the right guy to marry. Wat. 

I would skip trying to get your mom to understand unless you can convince her to stop guilting you because she makes you feel WORSE. I would just tell her you know, you don't HAVE to be social all the time. You don't HAVE to be happy just for her sake. Honestly her behavior kind of sets off a lot of red flags for me! She sounds like a lot to deal with even if she is well-meaning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You guys are cute. Firstly - stop thinking he saved your life. Give yourself some credit girl. You two have helped each other, but it's what you do in your own brain that helps you feel better. 

I think you just have a lot of issues with self-esteem. That's something that you have to learn - how to learn to be okay on your own. Let's say he did leave you for someone prettier - why would that upset you so much? If he was the kind of person to leave you for a prettier girl, is he the kind of guy you want? 

People can add happiness to your life, but people come and go. You can only truly rely on you. You say he is your number 1 in your life...well, YOU should be your number one. Focusing on yourself, bettering yourself, trying to make yourself happy - that is a very attractive trait to have. And if he does leave you, or your relationship ends for some reason, don't sweat it. You're 18. When I was 18, I thought I had found my soul mate. I married my high school sweetheart. By the time I turned 23 I was divorced. I don't regret it, because it made me learn a few things about life. Just relax, have fun with him, and if you go to college, and things change, don't worry about it. 

If you feel bad for venting, try venting to someone else. I felt a little bit like this with my current partner. It just went away with time really - and the time that I do spend with my partner I want to be a positive experience. I rant a little bit but I don't let it take up our whole time together, you know?

Good luck! You're young. Work on improving your self-esteem and doing YOU for YOU rather than someone else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oof. I feel you on the "didn't want to be dragged down with me," story. I had an ex-husband who dealt with my depression by cheating on me and telling me he was going to "help" my mental problems by leaving me. Now that I think about it, my first boyfriend broke up with me after I confided in him that I was very depressed - all the way back in middle school. That sucked!

As far as the army goes, obviously your parents care about you and infantry can be dangerous. Having been married to someone in the military, I would definitely suggest looking into a job that will prepare you more when you get out - like intel. Your parents may not like it, but it's your life. Talk to people in the army and figure out if it would be right for you. 

Why are you worried telling your parents about "the truth"? Do you think they won't believe you? I think opening up about how you feel would do you a world of good. Make an appointment with a therapist. You can just go one time if you wanted. Tell your cat, or your dog. I do this sometimes - I probably would seem crazy to someone else, but I will tell my cat my problems if I don't want to tell someone else. 

Out of all of the people I have told about my depression, maybe 5% of them reacted in a way I would deem negative. Most people understand or want to help. Sure, my ex-husband was kind of a bastard, but he doesn't define everyone. My parents took a while to get on board, and I still don't think my dad fully understands, and my mom keeps telling me my anxiety will go away if I do a cleanse because a nurse told her that once, but at least they know. And they care. Maybe they give me misguided advice sometimes, but it's something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally feel you. What I started doing was going on Khan Academy and doing the really easy math problems. It keeps my brain going and makes me feel good about myself. Or, I'll go on Code Academy and do some of the easy stuff like HTML/CSS and Javascript. It's nice, easy, and relaxing.

I used to bog myself down with "I should" thoughts, like, "I should have a degree by now," or "I should be more into politics," or "I should watch all of these boring documentaries so I can tell people about them and they will think I'm smart." It sucks because it makes me feel guilty about what I am doing. But I would say, open your eyes a bit more to the people around you. What do they do? When I was in a deep depressive period everyone around me seemed successful. Everyone had PhDs from Harvard and were curing cancer. Once my depression got better I realized that my brain was just foggy - some people are really successful, but the majority are like us - they have no idea what they are doing. A ton of my friends don't have college degrees. Or they have a kid they can't afford. Or they had to declare bankruptcy. Or they got laid off. Or they have an amazing degree and have an amazing job but they hate it. So opening your eyes to the reality of people's lives around you is a good exercise. And stop looking at people's Facebook pictures and getting depressed - people show you what they want you to see and nothing else (I still do this, guilty pleasure). 

What depression is, is an exercise in feeling good about yourself independent of others.

You say society makes you feel like you are being lazy. You say you have potential, which you do. But who do you have this potential for? Is it for society, or for yourself? Depression forced me to learn how to do things that I was good at for me rather than for others. I got into baking recently. I do it because I love kneading bread. I cook bread in a cast iron dutch oven so that when I open the oven and peak in to see the bread it looks magical and crispy and wonderful. I don't even want to eat the bread - once it's out of the oven I'm over it. My freezer is filled with uneaten bread. I don't know what to do with it. My SO tells me I'm nuts. But I don't bake bread for other people. I don't do it to show off my baking skills. No one is really going to see my bread. I don't need to prove to anyone that I'm good at it. For all I know I could be horrible at it. I don't care. If I started baking bread for family members or to prove I can make wonderful tasting bread, I would start to despise it almost immediately. I would get extremely anxious about it. If I baked a loaf that didn't turn out right, I would probably have a mental breakdown and cry for a few hours. But when I bake bread for me...if I open up the oven and it looks wonky, I'll say to myself, "Hm. Well that's interesting." And move on with my life. 

Tell your depression to fuck off. It's okay if you don't leave the house all day. It's okay if you sleep a lot. Forgive yourself. Once you lose some of that guilt I think your true potential will shine through. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was also equally clueless but my parents were very helpful. What you can do is, there should be a number on your insurance card, or a website you can visit. From there, you can tell them you need to find a general practitioner in your area, tell them you want a female, and they should be able to provide you with a list of doctors within a certain area that are in your network. 

I did this when looking for a psychologist - the guy on the phone actually emailed me a list of people I could see which was incredibly helpful. However, it depends on your insurance. 

Alternatively, you could just call up a doctor, or a hospital, tell them you want to find a female doctor/make an appointment, and the receptionist should be able to help you find someone. However, then you need to make sure they accept your insurance. 

Check your insurance card! Let us know how it goes :) This is such a common question. I was just telling my parents the other day they should teach us this crap in school!!!

EDIT: Once you've been given a list of people in your network, just call them and tell them you are a new patient. They should tell you if they are or aren't accepting new patients - some doctors aren't. Sometimes they will list that information online too...it's a long process but hopefully when you find a good doctor you can stick with them for a while! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I start a new job where I need to dress business professional. I've never really dressed for a business environment so this is my first foray into heels and pantyhose. 

Problem: so I wore pantyhose to my interview and thank god I waited to go to the bathroom until after the interview because after I tried to pull them up I ripped them. I thought, well, I was just too rough, next pair I get I'll be gentle and it will be fine. NOPE. I wore these pantyhose for like maybe three hours, and they have holes already by my knees and heels. What the fuck? These things are the most fragile things and it looks SO horrible to have a hole in your pantyhose. 

So what am I supposed to do? Am I just buying shit pantyhose? How much are they supposed to cost? I spent 7 dollars on each pair. It's so fucking aggravating. The holes I got in my pantyhose today weren't even from anything...I was sitting for like 90% of that time. I just can't afford to go through all these fucking pantyhose! 

My mom tells me I should wear tights, but that just reminds me of being a little kid, you know? I want nice, sheer pantyhose - can I get that in tights? 

Anyway, thanks for the help ladies!

EDIT: Do I even need to wear pantyhose? My mom was convinced I need to wear them, but now she says her friends who work in an office don't wear them - she said, and I quote, "They're old school." Thanks mom. So can I get away with wearing a business skirt and jacket combo without the pantyhose? Thanks!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's great! I wouldn't be able to sit through my classes without it. I'm a returning adult student and I have done better this semester than ever before. I'm also starting a new job and I'm so glad I have the Zoloft to help me. It's really made me realize that the only thing holding me back was my anxiety. It's a great feeling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm on 50mg of Zoloft, and its great. I had no side effects except for nausea, which has since gone away. I also take it at night which helped the nausea in the beginning. I had no sexual side effects, which I had with Paxil. I find that the Zoloft really helps quiet my mind. I had bad anxiety in public and it helped quiet the anxious thoughts so I can just focus. 

Think positively and give it a chance. It's not going to work immediately, it took me about a month to see a significant change.

Good luck! And if it doesn't work out, once you hit 18 you can try something else.

<TITLE> Why do I get anxious and flushed after eating? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-10 23:28:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As long as I can remember I have had issues with eating and anxiety. When I was a kid I would hate going to restaurants because I would feel sick, not eat very much, and would go to the restroom multiple times to try to calm down. I also remember my first bad panic attack was right after I had eaten dinner.

I have been to a few doctors and a gastroenterologist. I was put on an acid reducer and they told me I just had acid reflux. I started on an SSRI and thought it would help my stomach problems, but it hasn't. I get really nervous going out to dinner because I know I'm going to either experience a panic attack or severe anxiety. I feel extremely hot and sometimes feel like I have to go the bathroom. 

I started thinking maybe I had some food allergy or intolerance, and so my doctor put me on a liquid diet for 3 days. I felt better and then started an elimination diet, but as soon as I started eating food again my symptoms came back. They say when you do the elimination diet you're supposed to feel better and better, but I never felt better. I tested different foods and nothing seemed to cause problems specifically - just eating alone made me feel bad. 

So what's the deal? I haven't been able to figure this out and it sucks. I hate feeling so anxious from food. I don't know if it's a physical reaction like a food intolerance or just a mental response. I've also been tested for celiac and the test was negative - I cut out gluten for 2 weeks on my elimination diet. So I'm at a loss. I've had this problem as long as I can remember.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have heard of this study before. What's weird is that I was on a ketogenic diet (20g of carbs or less a day) for three months to lose weight. I didn't notice any change in my acne. I wonder if I would need to continue the low-carb diet for long? Or maybe some other food is at play here... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hm...well I did include them one by one, and they do help - for a while. But like I said, every few weeks I'll have bad skin. Is it possible the products could cause this? I assumed products that clog my skin would consistently clog my skin.

What products would you recommend I cut? I didn't have my AHA toner for a few days and my skin was just awful, so I don't want to cut that. But I could experiment going with the snail bee essence, because I'm not sure it really does much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone! Here is my routine:

**AM:**

* Rinse face with water
* Silk Naturals Super Defense Serum
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Cerave PM
* Biore Watery Essence Sunscreen

**PM:**

* Double cleanse with sunflower oil and Cerave Foaming Cleanser
* Sometimes cleanse again with Neem Oil
* Silk Naturals AHA (wait 20 minutes)
* Stridex in the red box (wait 20 minutes)
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Cerave PM

I occasionally use sheet masks and do a mint julep mask once or twice a week. If I have acne flare ups I will use a benzoyl peroxide cream (5% or 10%). 

So my skin seems to be affected by some factors I haven't figured out yet. I have followed this routine for over six months. It has really helped my skin texture. However, I will have great skin for a while, and then I will have 5-6 active pimples or closed comedones will randomly appear. These will last a week or two, and then my face will recover. 

So, what am I missing? My diet is fairly consistent (I don't eat great, but I'm on a college budget), and I drink water. Nothing seems to change from one week to the next. My flareups don't coincide with my periods either, and I'm on birth control (which hasn't really helped my acne in any way, but hasn't made it worse). So what factors am I not considering? What else can I add to my routine? Should I look into possible food triggers? 

My mother was telling me that she thinks it's because I drink a lot (I drink probably 3-4 nights out of the week, but never to excess), and I also eat a lot of carbs. Could this be a factor? I am a healthy weight despite my crap diet haha. 

Anyone have any advice? I would greatly appreciate it!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't want to spend money on a test, you can do an elimination diet at home. [This](https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/sites/default/files//webfm-uploads/documents/outreach/im/handout_elimination_diet_patient.pdf) is the document my doctor gave me.

As you can see, you essentially eliminate all possible allergens or intolerances from your diet. No alcohol, no caffeine, no corn, no wheat, no dairy, etc etc. You are extremely limited in what you can eat. After you practice this diet for 2 weeks, your symptoms should disappear. Then, you can add in certain foods that are common triggers. I.e. dairy.

It's very comprehensive. And, except for buying food, it's free! You just get to experiment with your body. And, hopefully you can pinpoint what foods trigger skin problems.

Good luck! You can PM me for more information, especially on what foods you should eat. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Troubleshooting sourdough loaf - dough expanded too much? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-03 03:47:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I made this basic sourdough loaf with this recipe that I got [here](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/basic-sourdough-bread-recipe). I mixed it up at night (around 9PM), kneaded it until window pane, and then set it up in a proofing basket above my fridge which is a good 70-75 degrees. I covered it in plastic wrap and went to bed.

When I woke up this morning, the dough had expanded over the proofing basket. It had this weird crust on it even though the plastic wrap was on it. Inside the crust the dough look strange - like my sourdough starter does. It looked like the gluten development had broken down overnight. 

Did I use too much sourdough starter? My starter has been particularly active lately. I ended up punching down the dough and reshaping the loaves. The bread was alright, but the crumb was very dense - probably from the second reshaping I assume.

So where did I go wrong? I was really confused that my dough had the hard crust on it - I assumed the plastic wrap was very air tight. 

Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've dealt with depression for about 8 years now. I have been on and off different SSRIs. Currently I take 50mg of Sertraline, and have been on it for about 6 months. I have improved, and for some reason because I have improved my psychiatrist has stopped increasing my dosage. Is this normal? 

I don't see a therapist currently. I saw many therapists in the past but I really don't enjoy it, don't like spending the money, and never found it to be very helpful. 

I have made a few life changes within the past year - I got out of a bad relationship, changed career paths, have become very successful in school, and have made a few friends and become more social. 

But I do all of these things and still feel very, very depressed. I'm getting scared that I will be like this forever. I have developed a lot of fears over the years - planes, illness, death, driving with other people, restaurants, large crowds, needles. The list of the things I'm afraid of keeps getting bigger. I don't know what to do. I'm stressed all the time and I don't know how to relax - typically I only really relax if I'm drinking a lot. 

What other things can I do to get better? Will I always be depressed?  </TEXT>

A part of working through depression is being okay with failure or admitting you need help. Is there a classmate you could ask to help you?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had a starter for about a month now. About two weeks ago I put it in the fridge and only fed it about four times, so twice a week.

Before I had it on the counter and it was doubling between feeds and was nice and bubbly.

So I want to do some baking so I put it out on the counter, and now I'm feeding it twice a day with AP flour and water from the tap. Its bubbling and has a great smell, but its not rising. The temperature in my kitchen varies, but for the last two days its been generally 75 degrees because I was cooking a lot.

What other things could I be doing wrong? Should I keep feeding it twice a day or once a day? I started giving it some rye flour because I heard that helps.

Thank you!!! </TEXT>

I like Amlactin lotion or the new Gold Bonds Rough and Bumpy Lotion. You need to keep up a constant routine to keep it at bay. I use exfoliating gloves on my KP and then use a moisturizer like Amlactin. Keeping the area shaved, exfoliated, and moisturized will help reduce its appearance.

<TEXT> I've been hearing about how different products treat acne at different levels of the skin. How accurate is this? So I'm using an AHA now and I'm getting a few whiteheads popping up, and I read that those are pimples that were just below the surface, but if I want to treat all of the underlying acne I need to add a retinoid. So...will I still get acne even using an AHA and BHA? It grosses me out thinking about acne lying underneath the surface of my skin.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really think it depends on your skin. I think a lot of the time when people argue against lots of products, it's because if they did use a bunch of products one of them was probably causing breakouts/irritation. More products = more chances of your skin responding poorly, especially if you have sensitive skin.

My routine is pretty long because I have lots of things I want to fix. Layering products has helped not only with my acne and skin texture, but my skin is so hydrated and I never have issues with dryness or oilyness like I did before when I did nothing for my skin. 

Skin is very personal. I use lots of different products and it works good for me because I have slowly added them in - it's taken maybe half a year to get to this point? Some people want a short, quick routine, and that's fine!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To repair your barrier, check out [this](http://blog.skincare-addiction.com/barrier/) link on the subreddit blog. 

I would caution against using an AHA if you want to repair your barrier. As the article I linked suggests, use a gentle cleanser, moisturize, and wear sunscreen everyday. 

For product recommendations, I use Cerave PM which is excellent. It has niacinamide in it which will help with PIH. I have also used the Cerave moisturizer that comes in the tub and I quite like that as well. I have started using the Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion (you can find it at Walgreens in the US) in addition to the Cerave PM and it's quite moisturizing. 

You can find more product recs for moisturizer in the sidebar, I personally love Cerave but people sensitive to fatty alcohols should avoid it. I also used to put a thin layer of Vaseline over my moisturizer at night - this seals in moisture and helped keep me hydrated during the harsh winter months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my routine:

**AM**

* Rinse Face
* Silk Naturals Super Serum 
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Mizon All-In-One Snail Repair Lotion
* Cerave PM OR Cerave in the tub (I have both)
* Neutrogena Dry Touch SPF 30

**PM**

* OCM with mineral oil 
* Cleanse with Cerave Foaming
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel 
* Stridex pads in the red box - wait 20 minutes
* Silk Naturals 8% AHA - wait 20 minutes
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion
* Mizon All-In-One Snail Repair Lotion
* Cerave PM
* If skin needs it, light layer of vaseline

I introduced everything one product at a time and patch tested everything. I'm going to be replacing my sunscreen once it's out with something that has a higher SPF and that isn't so greasy.


Questions:

1.) How often should I be using the 8% AHA? I have a small sample bottle that I have been using sparingly about 3 times a week. I've ordered the full bottle and once I get it, should I use it every day? I currently use the Stridex everyday with no issues and no dryness. 

2.) How is my order? Do I need to wait at all after applying the Super Serum? My motivation for this product is to reduce the appearance of acne scarring and improve my skin's appearance - has anyone had any success with this serum?

3.) Whenever I apply literally anything on my neck I get acne. It's really annoying. Is it okay to just leave this area alone and only apply sunscreen? Products that are fine on my face do not work well on my neck - so I assume it's too sensitive. 

4.) I got this patch of acne on my butt region. I applied Stridex immediately after I noticed it, and the acne went away pretty much overnight. Now I am left with red bumpiness that isn't going away. What's the deal? I apply Alpha Hydrox lotion to my body, so if I put it on my butt will it help at all? I shower everyday and exfoliate the area. 

5.) I woke up today with a pimple by my eyebrow, and I was really excited because it's been a small bump forever and I believe the AHA caused the pimple to surface. So my question is, how long do people normally purge with an AHA? 

I know that's a ton of questions, but I'd really appreciate some insight! I think I'm really close to having a perfect routine for my skin.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I started using the silk naturals AHA toner every other day, in addition to my Stridex pads every day. I've been breaking out, which I assume is purging. How long should this go on before I stop breaking out? I'm wondering how long I should continue to use the product. I am not breaking out horribly, maybe 3-4 small whiteheads you can barely see. 

I'm using up the sample bottle of it and I'm wondering if I should invest in the large bottle. My skin texture has definitely improved but like I said I have a few whiteheads in areas where I normally get acne. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking to incorporate an AHA into my routine. I tried the Alpha Hydrox Glycolic Lotion, but I believe the concentration was too high or something in the lotion broke me out. I formed a lot of tiny white heads in places I never got acne before. 

I am looking at the Silk Naturals AHA toner or Paula's Choice 8% AHA. I am leaning towards the Silk Naturals because it is lactic acid, but I don't know if it's too gentle. I have tried a sample version of the AHA and while I do like it, it doesn't make my skin as smooth as the Alpha Hydrox did. However, since the PC Aha gel also has glycolic acid, does that mean it will potentially break me out?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been having issues with going out in public and anxiety/depression. Basically I feel physically sick, my stomach hurts and I literally cannot eat at all. This sucks because if I'm out at a restaurant I am always having to tell people oh, I don't feel well, or I ate before, blah blah. And they must think I'm just rude or something. 

I've been coping with this by just drinking obnoxious amounts. This is sort of a gamble, because either I drink and have a good time, or I drink and become more depressed and then hate myself, and then it's just not fun for anyone. HOW can I enjoy going out? I don't want to be a shut in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My current routine is:
AM - Rinse face, Cerave in the tub, Neutrogena SPF 30.
PM - OCM with mineral oil, cleanse with Cerave Foaming, Stridex red box, Hado labo replenishing lotion, then Cerave PM - sometimes vaseline too if I'm feeling dry.

So I trimmed down my routine because something was breaking me out, now I'm doing alright. I'm also on BC so I think that is helping. I haven't missed a single night in cleansing and I sleep on a new pillow case every night. 

I want to know about recommendations for how to improve my skin further. I think I've pretty much controlled my acne, but I'm concerned adding another product in will cause problems. I ordered a sample of the 8% AHA toner from Silk Naturals and patch tested it and I like it, but it's hard to tell if it's doing much for my skin. 

I also have a lot of redness from spots. I wear sunscreen every day and it is fading some. I ordered the super serum from Silk Naturals - would this be a good product to buy the full bottle of? I was also looking into the OST C20 serum. 

Also, this is sort of unrelated but I have some deep scars on my leg and a few burn scars on my arm. They are white and sort of raised. Is there anything that will lessen their appearance other than going to a derm for treatment? It's sort of embarrassing. Thanks!! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have issues with getting things done, and putting tasks off definitely makes me more depressed, yet I can't bring myself to actually do them. I feel this weird euphoria when I PLAN on doing something and then DON'T do it. Then over the next few days I feel horribly guilty, and to get over that I put off more tasks to feel better, and so on and so forth, and I remain pretty depressed. 

What can I do to slowly become more organized? I want to train my brain to feel good after completing tasks, but generally the pay off isn't as strong when I complete things like homework or updating my resume or cleaning my house. I also really want to be one of those people who loves to-do lists and can write a manageable to-do list and actually stick to it. 

I basically just build up the task so much - i.e. I need to clean my apartment. I know I need to do it, but I think, whatever, it's clean enough, and I put it off. Then it gets worse, and I start feeling guilty, but I tell myself it's fine. It keeps getting worse, and I stubbornly refuse to clean it at this point. I tell myself, "I'm going to do this when I feel like it," and I never do. Then it's so awful the guilt basically consumes me and it takes me practically 5 hours to clean my place and afterwards I despise cleaning so much that I let it get to that state continuously. It's just exhausting, and it is definitely allowing my depression to continue. 

Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!! </TEXT>

I have a new partner and I have a great time with them and enjoy myself. If they end up cheating on me it will hurt obviously but at least I'll be able to say I had fun while it lasted. The cheating doesn't negate the entire relationship. 

It was hard to trust in the beginning. I kept thinking, this guy is going to hurt me eventually. Or, statistically he is going to cheat. And eventually I just had so much fun around him that I stopped caring. Enjoy the moment. You dont want to ruin a good thing by thinking about what could happen in the future. 

Plus I keep telling my SO if he feels the need to cheat let's just have a threesome lol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have two products I use for a BHA, one is the Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion and the other is Stridex in the red box. I find that Stridex is *massively* better than the Rapid Clear. Why would this be when they are both 2% SA? 

Like, this is TMI but I broke out weirdly on my butt (never happens to me) so I used stridex, and the next day it was basically entirely gone. What is this voodoo magic? The rapid clear lotion is not that effective. Is it because it's a lotion? Whereas the stridex is just the SA? 

Also, I'm switching to the Silk Naturals AHA toner from Glycolic acid as that was too strong. How often should I use it? I have a sample currently and a big bottle is on the way. With the sample I used it sparingly (3x a week). </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is decent advice, but know that some products will break people out. You could be using a group of products religiously and still breakout. There are so many variables in skincare and we don't know why some people break out and others don't, and it's frustrating when you get told you just aren't following your routine religiously enough. 

If you have skin care issues I would check out /r/skincareaddiction and if your acne is severe enough see a derm.  </TEXT>

I also just sampled the AHA toner from Silk Naturals and I'm really loving it! It doesn't cause me to break out and it works really nicely. I will probably order a full bottle and incorporate it into my daily routine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally love it. It was the first moisturizer I tried from this subreddit's recommendation. It never broke me out and kept my skin hydrated. However, if I use it on the skin around my eyes it tends to dry them out, so now I apply a bit of Vaseline on top around my eyes and that seems to help a lot. 

It does have fatty alcohols in it, which can cause issues with certain people.  </TEXT>

I have been massaging my face harder when I cleanse with oil, which is possibly irritating my skin. But I do moisturize thoroughly and use Vaseline at night. I do wait between products, generally 20-30 minutes between the AHA and BHA, so I believe the products have enough time to work. I only use my AHA about 3-4 times a week though, more than that is too much. 

I guess I'll just have to be patient! I don't want to end up with scars.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Keratosis pilaris (KP) improvement, with pictures and details of routine. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-12 19:08:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone! So I have mild KP on my body, most noticeably on my legs and my arms. For those who don't know KP is basically bumps, either white or red, on your skin that don't go away. They are extremely common, I believe 40% of people are affected. It's genetic I believe - my dad has the same skin. You can read more about it [here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratosis-pilaris/basics/definition/con-20025750). 

After doing some research on this condition, I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTX542IdCjM) video by Veronica Gorgeois that I found extremely helpful. 

I followed her advice and this is my routine:

* Exfoliate the affected area whenever I shower with exfoliating gloves. (Note: According to Veronica, loofah's do not properly exfoliate. I found my gloves at Walgreens and they are very effective. I've been interested in picking up one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EZQGU4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8 colid=1U84WIYAMJ69 coliid=I31O0ILSLEBO9S) Salux cloths too).

* Shave the area with mineral oil or coconut oil. If you are acne prone on your body I would advice against coconut oil, but mineral oil should be okay. I find it more moisturizing than shaving cream. (Note: I use a double edge razor and use a fresh blade each time. I get a much smoother shave and less irritation. You can find more info at /r/wicked_edge).

* I keep the area as moisturized as possible. I apply [Vaseline Intensive Repair Lotion, Fragrance Free](http://www.vaseline.us/product/intensive-care/lotions/advanced-repair-fragrance-free-lotion.html) after showering and whenever they feel dry.

* Every other night I use [CeraVe SA Renewing Cream](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/sa-renewing-cream). This helps chemically exfoliate my skin and keeps it really smooth. Admittedly it's expensive at $20 a tub. For a cheaper option I recommend the Gold Bonds Rough and Bumpy lotion or AmLactin.

The downside of all of this is that this routine doesn't permanently fix anything. The KP returns quickly once I stop using lotion. It's a little depressing...but if I want smooth legs I can get there within a day or two. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/RMRV5) are the pictures of my left calf. Ignore the cut - I'm still learning how to use my DE razor lol. I know the lighting isn't quite the same but I can assure you the spots have definitely reduced in size and my skin is very smooth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like every therapist I've been to is awful. They've each given me awful advice. One therapist suggested that, despite not being happy with my husband (ex-husband now), I should stay with him for stability while in school. She also implied I wouldn't be able to take care of myself financially without him. Another insisted I get on birth control because, "having a baby would make your depression 100x worse." The last therapist I saw was probably the best, but in the end I didn't find it helpful. Under my insurance I pay 30 dollars, which isn't so bad, but I can't afford 30 dollars every week. 

How can I find a good therapist? I get recommendations from doctors and from my university but I never like any of them.  </TEXT>

I'm not sure how formal it was but he had me complete worksheets on my thoughts. I didn't see any improvement and he started telling me I have the tools to be happy but I'm not putting the effort in. So... I stopped going because I felt like a failure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been on Zoloft for a few months. My doctor stopped upping my dosage so I'm stuck with only 50mg. Basically I told her there was improvement so she said there was no reason to up the dosage. Is this normal?

Basically the medication has helped the anxiety I have in social situations and has helped with panic, but I still have depression and anxiety symptoms every day. I can get through my day to day responsibilities but I'm not really happy. I'm really sick of it, I've felt this way for around 10 or more years and it's really disappointing. 

I've seen around 5 different therapists and they all seemed like a waste of money, so I'm not interested in going into therapy. The only professional I see now is my psychiatrist. Anyway, just needed to rant. I just assumed if I had the motivation to get things done I would be happy, but that isn't the case. I'm just so blah all the time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is this true? I have had doctors tell me two different stories and I don't know what to think. My last doctor said birth control may increase appetite. It's odd because on the pill I don't gain weight but with depo I did. The doctor that gave me depo said I could possibly gain a ton of weight...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went through two containers of that stuff. It smells great and the formula isn't greasy. It's not too expensive compared to other products for KP. So far I've used Alpha Hydrox lotion, gold bonds, cerave renewing SA Cream, and am lactin. Gold bonds wins hands down. I like the results from the cerave but it leaves my skin feeling sticky and weird. Totally recommend the gold bonds! 

I also recommend using it as little as you can afford to and moisturize with a cheaper body lotion in between. Kind of obvious but keeping the skin moisturized helps with the bumps. I can get away with every other day now, and keeping the areas shaved, moisturized, and exfoliated. 

The sad part is after a few days of not using it my legs were red and bumpy again :(  </TEXT>

I then said miscarriages are PHYSICALLY traumatic. For everyone. I am not a fucking victim, are you retarded? It's irritating that I'm getting blasted for believing miscarriages are a huge deal, which apparently, they aren't. I haven't had a miscarriage. I haven't gotten an abortion. Excuse me.

If someone has a miscarriage, they should go to the fucking doctor to make sure that everything is fine. It's physically traumatic on your body. Like, what in the fuck is everyone smoking? If someone has a miscarriage and doesn't know it, which apparently is the case a lot of the time, then so be it. God forbid we take a miscarriage seriously. Fucking hell. </TEXT>

Not that I'm even arguing anything...it's ridiculous.

<TEXT> I've dealt with anxiety for most of my life, including panic attacks. Exercise helps immensely with anxiety, especially cardio. I also really like yoga because stretching seems to help. Meditation is extremely effective for anxiety and stress, even if you don't know what you're doing. Absolute beginners who meditate 20 minutes a day experienced improvements in anxiety!

Also, I tend to experience a lot of anxiety right before and during my period. Try to reduce any stress in your life. Chat with a friend about your anxiety - I'm sure they've experienced something similar. You don't need to deal with anxiety alone. 

The good news is, panic attacks don't present you with any immediate danger. Basically your body is prepping you for a flight or fight response. You might feel like you can't breathe, your heart might race, and you might feel hot/flushed, but those are temporary physical symptoms. If I have a panic attack I remind myself that it's temporary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was one study that showed women who get raped have higher incidents of pregnancy during that year, which has absolute zero to do with arousal. 

Edit: Not to mention, here is the abstract from your cited article (I wasn't able to find the full text) - "The review examines whether unsolicited or non-consensual sexual stimulation of either females or males can lead to unwanted sexual arousal or even to orgasm. The conclusion is that such scenarios can occur and that the induction of arousal and orgasm does not indicate that the subjects consented to the stimulation. A perpetrator&#8217;s defence simply built upon the fact that evidence of genital arousal or orgasm proves consent has no intrinsic validity and should be disregarded." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone. I need some help figuring out where to go with my routine. I had a really elaborate routine and I had thought my skin was improving. The texture was really smooth and my skin felt very hydrated. I patch tested everything by applying a small amount by my neck area/jawline, and I had no adverse reactions to any products. 

However, I was getting acne in places I never did before. I had a bad breakout on my neck, jawline, and the area around my mouth. I originally suspected my Alpha Hydrox Lotion, which has 10% glycolic acid. I cut that out for a week and was still getting new blemishes, and eventually I got frustrated because my skin was looking worse than before I started a routine. 

So, now I have a TON of products and I want to figure out what makes me breakout and what will help my skin. How do I do this? I believe I should introduce one product and use it for at least a few days. Should I increase this time to a week? Or two weeks? 

My uncomplicated routine currently is rinsing my face in the morning and applying sunscreen. At night I remove any makeup with makeup remover or mineral oil, and then cleanse with Cerave foaming cleanser and moisturize with Cerave in the tub. I've been using my Burts Blemish Stick on any acne because I've used that since high school and have found it works pretty well. 

So should I wait until my current breakouts subside to start introducing products? How big of an area should I patch test? I was considering doing the entire side of one face because I patch tested before but I never had a bad reaction. Also, how long should I be patch testing these products?

I'm sorry this is so long! I'm also experiencing some stress and I started a new birth control pill (which will hopefully help with breakouts). I just spent a fair amount of money on these products and did quite a lot of research, so I'd prefer to keep as many of them as I can. 

Thank you guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm curious about how long spot treatments are supposed to take to reduce acne. I really do not notice a difference between using a spot treatment on a pimple and not using one at all. They still take the same amount of time to go away no matter what I do.

I have tried using diluted tea tree oil, BP 2.5%, BP 10%, the aztec clay mask, a 2% salicylic acid lotion, neem oil, and the Burts Bees Blemish Stick. 

I would almost like to take pictures of my acne and compare how quickly pimples fade with each treatment vs. no treatment. If anything spot treatments just irritate my face. 

So...what should I do? I'm basically going back to square one with my face (using very basic products) and slowly reintroducing products because I'm sort of at a loss for what to do with my skin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to discuss with your mom that you are experiencing anxiety. It's difficult for people to understand why you may not be going to school other than assuming you are lazy or a bad kid. 

Sometimes parents need other adults to explain anxiety to them. Speaking with your school counselor about your anxiety, or a teacher that you trust, can help you get the help you deserve and need. If you have a friend who you trust, take them with you. 

You deserve to have a good education and to do so in an environment you feel comfortable. I never told my parents about my anxiety and looking back I wish that I had, because I would have learned coping mechanisms a lot sooner. 

Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone have any recommendations for an at-home wax kit? I'd like to start waxing some areas on my face, my legs, and most importantly my bikini region. I don't want to spend a fortune if it turns out my skin can't handle waxing, since I've never done it before. But, I also don't want to get a cheap product that isn't effective. 

Also, I use AHAs and BHAs sometimes on my legs to help with my KP - will that make my skin more sensitive to waxing? 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can find the Alpha Hydrox line at a drugstore - I bought mine at Walgreens. They have a lotion that is 10% glycolic acid. If you do pick it up remember it's much stronger than the St. Ives so you'd have to work up slowly to see if your face can tolerate it. The bottle says to use it twice a day but that's insane - I would use it 3x a week or less to start off. 

[Here](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=5992) is some information on the product. They also sell products like pads that have 14% glycolic acid.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cleanser can probably remove most makeup on your face but you might have a tough time removing eye makeup like mascara or anything waterproof. I picked up a bottle of Neutrogena Oil-Free makeup remover and I swipe my eyes with a cotton ball and then go in with my OCM routine. 

Any oil-free makeup remover would probably be effective if your face doesn't agree with mineral oil.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem! I got advice from /r/wicked_edge and /r/ladyshavers. 

No, the Witch hazel does not sting. I have heard of people using rubbing alcohol to inhibit bacteria but I find that stings too much, and it's very drying. 

I really do recommend getting a razor where you can use double edge blades. That way you can use a fresh blade each time. If you'd like you could use a new disposable razor each time but buying a DE razor with blades will be much cheaper in the long run. 

I use the Dove deodorant which is fragrance free, I think it's the go sleeveless kind. It will say fragrance free or for sensitive skin on it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my procedure for removing hair down there is:

* Soak in the tub or shower for 15-20 minutes to soften hair. 
* Exfoliate area with exfoliating gloves. 
* Apply mineral oil to hair. 
* Let oil sit for a few minutes. 
* Use a fresh blade with my double edge razor (you can find recommendations on /r/wicked_edge) 
* Shave with the grain, then horizontally, then against the grain if there is no irritation. I pass along the hair 2-3 times only. The fresh sharp blade helps a lot with this. 
* Wash area clean, then pat dry. 
* Dab area with witch hazel.
* Swipe area with a deodorant stick (the no fragrance kind) that I bought specifically for after shaving down there. 
* To prevent ingrown hairs I swipe with stridex pads when I use them on my face at night. 

I don't get ingrown hairs but sometimes the area can still get irritated. A fresh blade and a double edge razor was the thing that most improved the skin in that area.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could try the Witch Hazel. I have never personally used ACV. I use Thayer's Witch Hazel and I don't find it does much other than keep my skin feeling fresh and moisturized. 

Your skin looks very nice by the way! It is hard to see the white bumpiness, but it's possible it's normal. 

Take a look at [this](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/exfoliators/8-aha-toner-652.html) product. It's an AHA, but it has a short ingredient list. It uses lactic acid to exfoliate the skin. 

I looked into ACV for exfoliating and it's possible it could mildly exfoliate the skin.

Also, you can experiment with oils. Look into rose hip oil, castor oil, or hemp seed oil. From a quick google search people claim they help with redness. I was going to incorporate rose hip oil into my routine for my eye area as I have heard it helps with wrinkles!  </TEXT>

She also throws up all the time, and she always does it on my pillow or my shoes. 

My SOs cat is also a total prick who will sit on your chest and bite your face until you pet him. He also waits by the door and tries to run out at any chance he gets. That fucker bit my eyebrow one morning. My SO currently has a scratch down the side of his face from his asshole cat.

<TEXT> Not necessary! You can use both. Some people use them both on the same day, or they alternate days, depending on tolerance. A BHA is good for acne (it can be drying), and an AHA tends to be moisturizing and help improve skin texture.

<TEXT> The small white bumps could be closed comedones or they could be regular sebaceous filaments (which are normal). It's hard to tell without a picture.

Unfortunately I don't know how to get rid of redness or the bumps without a chemical exfoliator like an AHA or BHA. I do know that people praise neem oil (I use it!) but I don't know if it would help the bumps. I do find it quite moisturizing though and it seems to help my acne. Most people do find the smell pretty bad, but I like it!

I have also heard safflower oil as a decent oil for the skin. It's moisturizing and I have heard it can help acne. 

You could think about incorporating an AHA (there are recommendations in the sidebar). It would improve your skin's texture and make it quite smooth, and possibly reduce the redness as well. However, it is not "natural." 

Edit: You could invest in a konjac sponge for light physical exfoliation if you wanted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where do you get the acne? Hormonal acne is common along the jaw line. If you are on the pill your acne is probably not hormonal.

You could add a BHA to your routine. Stridex in the red box is quite popular, or you could look at Paula's Choice BHA gel (they have 1% or 2%, if your skin is quite sensitive I would use the 1%). 

I believe the Clinique emergency gel lotion has 10% BP, which can be quite irritating. If you still want to use BP you could try something with 2.5% BP or 5% BP. Alternatively you can use diluted tea tree oil! You can add a drop or two to your moisturizer or dilute it in a carrier oil. 

Also, make sure you are changing your pillow case every night or sleeping on a t-shirt/towel. Make note of where you get acne and see if you can think of any possible triggers. Depending on how long you've been on the pill you could see continued improvement.   </TEXT>

What are your skin care goals? If you don't get acne, I would stick to simply keeping your skin moisturized and wear sunscreen daily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! Welcome to SCA. If you're just starting a routine, be sure to only add in one product at a time. Starting with a moisturizer is a great first step, and if jojoba oil works, that's great! Just know that some oils can break people out. A good starter oil is pure mineral oil as it breaks very few people out. 

Once you've settled on a moisturizer, I would incorporate a cleanser and a sunscreen. You only need to wash your face at night. 

I personally love my Cerave foaming cleanser. It's the first cleanser I bought after finding this sub and it works great and doesn't dry out my skin. 

Once your skin is used to the cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen, you can look into chemical exfoliation and spot treatments, which you can find recommendations for in the sidebar. Be sure to patch test so you can be sure a product will not break you out or cause a reaction. 

If you deal with cystic acne, is it possible to see a dermatologist? They could help with prescriptions.

Good luck! If you have any questions about your routine in the future this sub has a daily routine thread where you can post any questions you have :) I post there probably every day! And be careful, skincare is an addiction. Before I never used to wash my face but now I'm obsessed! </TEXT>

For example, I used an AHA for a few months and the skin on my nose, chin, and cheeks was extremely clear. Yet it broke me out on my jawline, neck, and forehead. So I just stopped using the product. 

It's your skin, so experiment with what works! You can use certain products only on certain areas, or you can try to find products that are for sensitive skin.  </TEXT>

Also, it took me a while to get used to sleeping with Vaseline on my face. And you don't need that much Vaseline. I started by putting a massive thick layer on my face, and you don't need that much! A thin layer works just as good as a thick one.  </TEXT>

The only time I got grits was when I used the Aztec Clay Mask before I did OCM. I was so excited. But the next week I did it again, and no grits :( Boo.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, for some people a simplified routine works and for others it doesn't. It's not really helpful to say that people overcomplicate their skincare. My brother has awful acne, has had awful acne since he hit puberty, and he has tried everything from seeing a derm and going on meds to doing absolute zero. 

For me, I never had huge issues with my skin other than mild acne. The products I use now have seriously improved my skin's texture and my face just feels so much better. If you look at my posts my skincare regime is quite long. 

Skincare is a mixed bag. It's frustrating when a simplified routine works for someone and not for others! It's definitely a very personal journey.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't used either of the products, but I did look at them. So, the face wash has salicylic acid in it, but it won't be on your skin long enough to do anything for your breakouts. I suggest looking into the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion, which has 2% salicylic acid if you like Neutrogena products. I have used this lotion and it's worked for me. 

So, the face wash is probably fine, but I would look into getting a spot treatment like the Acne Defense lotion, and then apply a moisturizer after. I hope that makes sense! 

Also, be sure to wear a sunscreen with SPF 30 (at least). If you have acne prone skin the sunscreen will help reduce the appearance of acne scars. 

OH, and I recommend only washing your face once per day. In the morning it's fine to just rinse your face and apply moisturizer, otherwise you risk drying out your skin too much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rant: It took me forever to figure out my Alpha Hydrox lotion was breaking me out. I used the 10% glycolic acid one and it was causing me little whiteheads on my neck and side of my face. Boo! Giving my face a break from AHAs right now.

Also, though I do think my tea tree oil is helping reduce my acne flareup from the AHA fiasco, it definitely makes my skin feel tight. What I've been doing is using a dropper to put the oil mix in my hand, and then rubbing it on the spots. What I might end up doing is taking a q-tip and dabbing it on only the acne, and then waiting a bit. For what it's worth I did dilute it so it's 10% tea tree oil to mineral oil.

Also, I love my Cerave in the tub. It makes my skin feel great. I was going to switch to Cerave PM because it has niacinamide in it. But I just love the way the Cerave in the tub feels on my skin, and I really don't like how the Cerave PM feels lol. Agh! I'm picky about how stuff feels on my face. 

Just bought: Cerave PM, another Mint Julep Masque (looove it), Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion, Tea Tree Oil (which I'm diluting with mineral oil), Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Pack, the Mizon all-in-one snail cream, and a giant amount of sheet masks. 

Raves: My sunflower oil is perfect for OCM. I also mix in neem oil and I LOVE it. The smell doesn't bother me at all! I was considering purchasing some safflower oil and mixing the three together. 

I also just have to rave about Vaseline. God I love it. I have gotten used to sleeping with it on finally even though I mash my face into my pillow at night. Oh well. It still keeps me moisturized, and I like to put some on my feet, knees, and elbows too! Oh, and my knuckles. My hands have never been smoother, and they are always insanely dry and patchy during winter. Not anymore!

Also, my Thayer's Witch Hazel with Rose and Aloe. Gosh. This stuff smells SO amazing and makes my face feel so good. I was considering transferring it to a spray bottle and misting it on my face during the day. Now that I'm a super skin addict I've been going out quite a bit without any makeup on so I don't have to worry about screwing that up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need some help with recommendations/product order. Here is my routine:

**AM**:

* Rinse face.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion (is this the western version of the gokujyun lotion?)
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Cerave in the tub if needed
* Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30


**PM**:

* OCM with sunflower oil and neem oil
* Cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser
* Thayer's Witch Hazel
* Stridex red box. Wait 20 minutes.
* Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion.
* Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence
* Diluted tea tree oil as a spot treatment
* Cerave in the tub
* Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask
* Vaseline

How is my order? Do I apply the Hado Labo Lotion before I do my Stridex? Also, how do I use the Mizon sleeping pack? How much do I apply? I put a thin layer on and didn't feel like it was thick enough so I topped it off with Vaseline. Is that okay? Can I apply a thicker layer of the sleeping pack? Also, the bottle says to use it 2-3 times a week. Is that what I should be doing? I'm currently working on evening out my skin tone and fading some PIH (possibly PIE? I'm not sure). 

Also, I had to stop using my Alpha Hydrox Lotion as an AHA because it broke me out. Is there a good Asian alternative for an AHA? Or do I even need one? 

I'm looking to replace my Neutrogena when it runs out with an Asian sunscreen, preferably with SPF 50. What are some good suggestions? The Neutrogena is pretty thick and it makes my face look kind of greasy. 

I'm also looking for a spot treatment. What are some good Asian spot treatments? I have been using my tea tree oil for a few days now and it's okay. 

And what is pig collagen? I see it a lot when browsing for products. The packaging is super cute but what exactly is it? And what the heck is placenta? Is it actually placenta? Thanks for your help! I'm pretty new to this :) </TEXT>

I even posted quite a while ago about how I broke out weirdly on my neck and didn't even think it's because I used the Alpha Hydrox! 

Super happy to report that I have no new breakouts, and the little whiteheads that popped up are disappearing (thank you tea tree oil). 

My next question is... I like ahas. They make my face smooth an moisturized. What should I try next? And how do I know what exactly broke me out from the Alpha Hydrox? Also, is it okay to use my BHA twice a day, or will that be too drying? 

Thank you guys so much!!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could consult a dermatologist. They could provide some help if you have the insurance or money for it. 

As far as what you could do for your skin otc, I would recommend applying a good sunscreen, at least spf 30, and wearing it every day, even if it's cloudy or you aren't going outside. 

Second, AHAs are good chemical exfoliators to help reveal a better layer of skin underneath the current layer. This will help improve your skin's appearance to a degree. It won't work miracles but I will say your face texture will improve. 

I would also look into something like a vitamin C serum which will help with acne scarring or evening out your skin tone. You can look at other serums too, a lot of people like the Super Serum from silk naturals. 

I've heard retinoids are helpful as well for anti aging, but honestly I know nothing about them. You can do a search in this sub for retinoids and find some useful info. 

Lastly, you're the most critical of your skin. What you see in the mirror isn't what other people see. As far as the big pores, lots of people have them, and you'd never know because most people aren't that close to your face! So don't stress too hard. 

I hope that helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heavy fragrances are commonly irritating. I read on here someone switching to a more organic brand like Seventh Generation helped with their acne. This is true for fabric softeners and fabric sheets as well. 

My other recommendation is changing toothpastes if you haven't already. Using a toothpaste without Sodium Lauryl Sulfate has helped many people with acne around their mouth/chin - I use Sensodyne personally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Using the Clarisonic once a day is very harsh on your skin. I recommend using it only 2 or 3 times a week. Physical exfoliation alone will not get rid of your acne, if anything it could make it worse. Please check the sidebar for more information on starting a routine for acne-prone skin.

It's up to you whether you want to return it. Some people love it, but every day is too much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.) I had never heard of Cleanance K, but according to Paula's Choice it doesn't have the right percentage of Salicylic acid to be effective. You can read more about that [here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/avene/_/Cleanance-K-Cream-Gel). It also has fragrance in it which could irritate your skin. 

I would not recommend the scrub. I personally avoid any kind of physical scrub because it's too harsh. I would try adding the PC 1% BHA Gel. 

2.) You could try the Paula's Choice cleanser. It seems to have good reviews. I would go on cosDNA and review the ingredients. I personally use Cerave Foaming Cleanser which is quite cheap and effective. They also have a hydrating cleanser. 

3.) If you have discoloration, incorporating an AHA into your routine may be effective. I would look into what Paula's choice offers as far as AHAs go. A lot of people like the Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I was curious about this too so I did some searching on this subreddit and over on /r/AsianBeauty. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1lpvse/explain_toner_to_me/) toner is described nicely. 

Over in Asian Beauty they use pH balancing toners and hydrating toners. I think each toner has a different purpose rather than all toners have the same purpose, you know? 

[Etude House Wonder Pore](http://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-Wonder-Freshner-500ml/dp/B005TTSDYW) is quite popular, and its main function seems to be pH balancing and reducing the appearance of pores. 

I personally use Thayer's Witch Hazel with Rose Water. It smells amazing and makes my skin feel very fresh. I use it right after my Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser. [Here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4f57150665.html) is the ingredient info on that - looks like it has pH balancers in it.

Typically American style toners are very drying because they have alcohol in them. Avoid any toner with alcohol in it, because this will worsen your dryness! I would head over to /r/AsianBeauty to search for a toner recommendation. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2i2opt/tonersmists_which_blow_you_away/) is a thread I found helpful, with lots of recommendations for toners for dry skin. 

Hope that helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My first suggestion is to incorporate a better sunscreen. SPF 15 is not enough. I would get something with at least SPF 30.

For the moisturizing issue, I would sample a different moisturizer. I had issues with dry skin in certain areas but when using Cerave in the tub moisturizer my skin is very moisturized during the day. You could look into that or Cerave PM, which are both pretty similar except the PM has niacinamide in it, which can help with PIH.

Also, some people have success with the Hado Labo Gokujyun Lotion, which you use in addition to a moisturizer. It is also called the Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion which is sold at Walgreens!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why are you using a face wash in addition to the salicylic wash? I'm wondering if this is too drying on your skin. Also, it is recommended to use SA in a lotion rather than a face wash, since the 30-45 seconds it is on your face is not enough time. I would recommend looking into a BHA lotion instead of the face wash. [Here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Lotion-Exfoliant/) is an example of what I mean.

Green tea does have anti-inflammatory properties, and there are actually a lot of skin care products with green tea in them that you apply topically. Could be worth looking into! There are a few asian products that come to mind, like Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum. I'm sure the green tea benefits you in other ways, like relaxing you! So it's not a bad habit :)

The sunscreen does moisturize, yes. If you don't feel like you need moisturizer in the morning you can skip it and only use sunscreen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm really disappointed because a product I am using is definitely causing me to break out. However, I am really not sure what product it is. Can someone help me figure this out? 

My routine is here:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion (SA 2%). Wait 20 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Apply a thin layer of Cerave in the tub.
* Apply Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30

**PM**

* OCM with sunflower oil and neem oil. Double cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Alpha Hydrox. Wait 30 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Sheet mask if I have the time.
* Apply a spot treatment to active pimples - either Burt's Bees Blemish stick, Clinique 10% BP gel, or 2.5% BP gel, or neem oil. Wait 10 minutes.
* Apply Cerave in the tub. Finish off with thin layer of Vaseline.

Okay, so I have used the following products without breakouts for a few months: all Cerave products, Alpha Hydrox, Neutrogena Lotion and sunscreen, sunflower oil and neem oil. I also don't react negatively to the BP spot treatments or my Burts Blemish stick. 

So that leaves the Thayer's Witch Hazel, which I recently incorporated into my routine, and the Benton Snail Bee (noooo). It's kind of funny because I should be more upset about my breakout but I'm kind of excited, because it's like a mystery I have to solve! 

So my plan is to reduce my routine to what I know does not cause breakouts (or at least, I'm 90% sure doesn't?). If that helps, then what should my plan be from there? Patch test the products again? Is it possible an old product caused me to breakout but didn't until now? Is it also possible none of my products are actually breaking me out and my boyfriend is right that I'm crazy and I just break out?

The thing is, I have weird bumps on my forehead, and my forehead is usually always freakin' clear. So it HAS to be a product, right? Also, could the vaseline be causing this? 

Also, one last thing, I created a DIY tea tree oil spot treatment, so 10% tea tree oil and the rest mineral oil. I know tea tree oil and mineral oil don't break me out, but my breakout coincided with the night I applied this to my spots. I just don't know...any help figuring this out is GREATLY appreciated! The breakouts are very very small bumps, some whiteheads, and honestly it's quite mild, but definitely a deviation from my normal skin. 

Thank you for the help, and sorry for the book!!

EDIT: I just remembered when I first started my new skincare routine I broke out on my neck, in a similar way I am breaking out on my forehead. At that point I was using Cerave foaming, Alpha Hydrox, and Cerave moisturizer. Could the Alpha Hydrox possibly be breaking me out too? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been hearing a lot lately that too many products in your routine is not a good thing, and that you can benefit from simplifying your routine. Is this a bunch of BS? My thought would be that if a routine with a lot of products isn't working, it's likely that one of those products is breaking you out, and so by simplifying it you just happen to get rid of the problem product. I've heard things like, you need to stop using so many products to give your face time to breathe and heal. This also sounds phony. Is there any evidence that less is more with skincare?

My routine is here:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion (SA 2%). Wait 20 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Apply a thin layer of Cerave in the tub.
* Apply Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30


**PM**

* OCM with sunflower oil and neem oil. Double cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser.
* Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel.
* Apply Alpha Hydrox. Wait 30 minutes.
* Apply Benton's Snail Bee High Content Essence.
* Sheet mask if I have the time.
* Apply a spot treatment to active pimples - either Burt's Bees Blemish stick, Clinique 10% BP gel, or 2.5% BP gel, or neem oil. Wait 10 minutes.
* Apply Cerave in the tub. Finish off with thin layer of Vaseline.


In addition I do a mint julep mask or aztec clay mask once a week.


I was considering adding in the OST C20 to my routine for Vitamin C. Where would this go in my routine? Also, I am going to be mixing tea tree oil and mineral oil to create a spot treatment in an amber dropper bottle. How do I go about figuring out percentages? Or should I ask in /r/DIYbeauty?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like your skin is dehydrated if it's producing that much oil. I would definitely make sure you are moisturizing and wearing sunscreen. 

Take a look at the sidebar and some product recommendations. When I first started I got a basic cleanser, a moisturizer, and a sunscreen. I made sure to take my makeup off, then switched my pillow cases more frequently. Then I added other products in slowly. You just have to be patient! I know it sucks because you are used to clear skin. 

If youve got any questions about specific products just ask in the routine threads, and be sure to patch test and introduce new products one at a time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yay! I'm glad I can help someone else out, even though I myself am pretty depressed. Depression is very lonely.

I like your description of depression. And then people ask you, why don't you just stand up? My SO has been upsetting me lately saying things like, "You create your own happiness." I feel like chemically my body can't do that sometimes. 

I read a quote once that said depression is like going into the woods and initially you can see out of it, you just go back the way you came. But go forward a few steps more and soon you don't know where you came in from and you're wandering around for a long time lost in these woods. And you don't know what direction you should turn, and it feels like every step you take you're more lost and alone. It was a really beautiful quote and I wish I could find it but that rings very true for me. I have to remind myself that it IS very chemical at its core, and that I'm not lazy or stupid or I don't try hard enough. What I actually like most about the metaphor is that when you're in the woods and you're lost there is a lot to learn if you just look around and experience it. 

And I really do feel like skincare and emotional health are very intertwined. Acne and other skin issues can wreck your self-esteem. So I think a lot of people on here are depressed, maybe even because of their skin. So I think it's related!

Today I stayed in my PJs because I'm feeling slightly under the weather (I actually do have a cold, haha), but also a little depressed. I ended up doing my OCM routine with sunflower oil and I remembered how good it feels. And if you haven't experienced a sheet mask you're missing out! They feel so wonderful, and the perfect pick me up for my sad days. 

I'm glad you're okay! I'm okay too :) </TEXT>

It depends in when you shower. I tend to shower before I go to bed, so I wash my face with oil to remove dirt and makeup, then I go in with a cerave foaming cleanser. You can get cleanser recommendations in the sidebar. I personally really like my cerave foaming cleanser. 

If you mean bar soap, no, you should not cleanse with that. Like I said there are recs in yeh sidebar depending on skin type! After that, apply the spot treatment and then wait for it to dry, then apply moisturizer.  </TEXT>

But I also second the Korean exfoliating towel, that is highly recommended! 

AmLactin is great! It really helped my bumps. Right now I'm testing out the Cerave SA Repair Lotion and it's working nicely too, but it's a bit expensive at 20 bucks a tub. I might go back to AmLactin but it is a bit smelly haha! 

Oh, and as far as general tips, I like to keep my skin very moisturized, so along with a medicated lotion like the AmLactin I use fragrance free vaseline intensive care lotion. I moisturize twice a day, once with each type of lotion.

<TEXT> I have struggled with depression for a while as well. Yes, it could be worse. But, it's bad for you right now, and that's okay. I think when we're in the midst of a bad rut of depression we run through a list of things to say to ourselves that end up making us feel worse. It's okay to feel depressed and to not wash your face or your clothes. Its okay to just be, honestly. 

I try to think of my depression as an illness, which, I guess it is, but more like when I have a cold or the flu. When I have the flu, I probably don't go through my whole morning routine. I probably don't wash my face, or change my clothes. I just relax. I lay in bed, watch movies, and allow my body to heal. Also, I forgive my body for getting sick, because it happens. And I ride it out, because I know it has an end. 

The same is true for your depression. It can feel endless, but give yourself time to heal. Forgive yourself. And your body, since there are a lot of physical sensations with depression. Don't feel guilty about skipping your regular routine. I am a big believer in that if you are good to yourself, especially emotionally, you will heal that much faster and be ready to face your routine again a lot faster. But if you feel guilt about that pause in your life, then healing takes a lot longer and you end up in a cycle of self hate. At least, I know I do! 
So relax. It's normal to have these feelings and it's okay. And your depression does have an end. You don't need to force yourself to do anything. I hope you have loved ones around you who can help you, but it sounds like you do.  </TEXT>

Does that mean my routine isn't as good as it could be? What should my goal be with my skin? 100% clear? Or just some improvement? 

And if I only get a pimple here and there, that doesn't mean a product is breaking me out, correct? Because that's pretty consistent with what my skin was like before. 

Is there anything I can add to my routine to prevent these pimples? It's possibly hormonal because I always get one painful pimple before my period. 

My routine is mornings, rinse my face, Thayers witch hazel, apply an SA 2% lotion, wait, apply benton snail bee essence, then apply BP 10% to spots, wait, apply cerave moisturizer, then sunscreen. 

Night I remove makeup, ocm with sunflower oil, cleanse with cerave foaming, witch hazel, alpha hydrox glycolic acid 10%, wait, occasional sheet mask, then snail bee, then the BP, wait, then I moisturize with cerave mixed with a bit of neem oil, then sometimes vaseline. 

One last question, I know my BP concentration is quite high. Could this be causing irritation and lead to more pimples? Or is that not possible? 

Thank you guys!!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yay! I totally feel the same. I have depression and anxiety and though I am on medication taking my own steps to better myself has helped a lot. 

And, as a bonus, when I'm really depressed and don't want to get out of bed, my skincare routine makes me want to!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much every time I wash my hands I use moisturizer. I carry some with me at all times. My hands are super smooth even now and I live in a cold climate. 

What I do at night is moisturize with lotion and then rub some vaseline on my knuckles to keep the moisture in. 

I got these Eucerin hand creams that I keep in my purse, they were half off at Walgreens! I prefer lotions that are fragrance free so Eucerin or Vaseline are good brands.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually use a cream that has 10% BP. My skin has been ok on it, sometimes it gets itchy and red, so I make sure to only put it on blemishes and wait for it to dry (10-15 minutes) before moving on to moisturizer. 

I would try it out so you don't waste money on something new. If your skin can tolerate it use it, but there isn't evidence to suggest that 10% BP is better than 2.5% or 5%. If your skin gets irritated I would switch to a 2.5% formula.  </TEXT>

I would use a spot treatment on it like SA or BP. Stridex pads were recommended and those would work well if you had someone to swipe it on your back! I would also make sure to keep your back clean and keep clothes clean.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it could very well be the Cetaphil. I would try to find a moisturizer without any fatty alcohols as these can be comedogenic. Look out for cetyl alcohol. If you need recommendations I would try searching fatty alcohols in the search bar in this subreddit, first result was moisturizer recs. I would link but I'm on mobile! 

Good luck! It could be a bunch of different factors too, hormones, excessive dryness, another product... Just keep experimenting. Skin is fickle. I'd try looking on Amazon for cheaper prices on skincare products!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with trying the Gold Bonds rough and bumpy, I went through two tubs of that stuff, it smells great. 

Right now I'm trying the Cerave SA repair cream with 2% salicylic acid. It's working great! I'll apply that about every other day, then use a fragrance free body lotion, right now I'm using vaseline intensive care at least once a day. 

Also, I use exfoliating gloves to physically exfoliate my body. You might want to check out /r/ladyshavers for some tips on shaving. I personally switched to a double edge razor and I use a fresh blade very frequently. I also find if I use mineral oil to shave my legs are quite a bit smoother. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. I would look for a cream that has 2.5% BP in it, as anything higher than that is too drying and possibly irritating to the skin, especially if you have never used BP before. I found a 2.5% BP cream at Walgreens, I believe it was a Walgreens brand actually. 

A lot of people have success with the Tea Tree Oil spot treatment from Burt's Bees, which is also a drugstore item, but I find the alcohol in it way too drying and it burns my face.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oo that's true! I've heard that one before. I think that's so strange because for me the act of spending time putting on makeup is so meditative. It really calms me down and since it's a routine it helps set me in the right mood. I really feel off during the day if I don't have makeup on and I don't think it's just because I look different - my brain likes routine haha. Honestly I would encourage people, men included, to spend more time on themselves with things like makeup or skincare because it just feels nice.  </TEXT>

I told him maybe he should try being romantic, and he tried really hard and it was super, super cute. He even said, "I'm trying to romance you." I laughed so hard. The fact that he tried was adorable. I think it's the effort that matters, and when a woman says she isn't in the mood it's like a cue saying, hey, be more romantic or caring!

<TEXT> When I was married I eventually started to hate sex. I saw it as a huge chore. Honestly I'm not sure why. I think I just wasn't attracted to him anymore and we really just got married too young and it was time to end things. With my SO now I LOVE sex and I want it all the time. I have never been as attracted to someone as my SO, it's insane.

I do feel like it's very, very important to me to have a stable emotionally intimate relationship with someone to properly enjoy sex. Maybe with those women they aren't feeling as emotionally satisfied and so don't enjoy sex as much. It's a give and take and I think a lot of relationships fail because they aren't communicating their needs properly. Thankfully I have learned from my mistakes in that regard and have a more fulfilling relationship now! </TEXT>

But every single time she did this, she would be like, "Oh my god I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not usually like this. I am usually really classy and want guys to take me out on a few dates first." Like LADY I KNOW YOU. You like to get laid, just accept it and move on. 

She did admit to me later on that she probably had a sex addiction, which totally makes sense why she would try to cover that up by acting like all of the hookups were just a one time thing. And it's possible she would say those things as a defense mechanism so girls wouldn't call her slutty. Funny thing is she would call other girls slutty and was really upset with me when I told her I slept with a dude on the first night.  </TEXT>

I know that sounds super shitty and it IS, but it is legitimately a way to become closer friends with someone. 

I try to balance it out by just participating in the conversation and not technically gossiping or being bitchy. For example, my mom was gossiping to me about her friend who has a PAIN KILLER ADDICTION and was like oh my god she's so messed up. And I'm like, wow, she must be going through a really tough time and needs a friend. I don't know...it's shitty but I do feel pressured into talking shit about people with certain girls just to fit in, even though I'm in my 20s. But I try to work around it! </TEXT>

I'm almost out of my first pack of sheet masks (I got the best selling MBD box of 7). Does anyone have any recommendations for a good mask? I really like the moisturizing ones and the whitening ones. Should I just stick with MBD? Or are there any cheaper ones? I like buying my stuff on Amazon but maybe it's cheaper to use a different site. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone! I finally came down with a cold this winter after lasting this long without being sick. 

My poor nose is red and irritated but I'm moisturizing it and putting a little Vaseline on it. 

I am honestly really proud of myself for sticking with a routine for so long. I used to be really gross and sleep in my makeup, and I struggled since I was a teen to keep up with a routine. Yesterday I came home from a night out after drinking and I still went through my whole song and dance. I honestly LOVE my routine, and it makes me really happy to do it. It's sort of meditative now!

Also, I took all my makeup off at my boyfriend's house and he said I looked really cute without makeup on! So now I'm a bit more confident about how I look without it haha. And this is coming from a girl who used to just sleep in her makeup because oh the horror of having a guy see my plain face. 

I'll stop rambling. Hope ya'll have a good Friday!  </TEXT>

Skin is pretty fickle though, so pay attention to how it reacts to the products. You may have to tweak things a bit but for now that looks like a solid routine.  </TEXT>

That's too bad about your skin :( If I notice a pimple I go crazy sometimes and that usually causes more pimples. It feels like my skin has a mind of it's own sometimes. Like oh, you're going to overexfoliate? Screw you! Here's some more acne. At that point I just have to relax and simplify my routine...it's hard though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I walk around a lot as I live in the city. I have a coat that has a hood that can button up around my face, or at least cover the area below my nose. That has been pretty good so far. If it's super cold (I live in Wisconsin) I will wear a scarf. I have a few that I rotate so I don't believe there would be any issue with them being too dirty.

Also, if you're worried about your skin drying out, I would put a thin layer of Vaseline on your face after your moisturizer, which will keep the moisture in! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people like Cerave products because they are very cheap. I would say look into a Cerave cleanser and a moisturizer (a lot of people like Cerave PM). Also, if you aren't wearing sunscreen during the day please check out the recommendations for one in the sidebar. 

As for the acne, I would look into the spot treatment recommendations. So that's about four products I believe? Cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen, and spot treatment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can I use my Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion (SA 2%) and my Alpha Hydrox (10% glycolic acid) both at night? I really don't have a lot of time in the morning to wait for the Neutrogena lotion (and I believe I have to wait 20-30 minutes?). Can I do both at night? And how long do I wait in between? 

I know I've seen people use the PC AHA and BHA both at night but I'm not sure how to go about it. 

Also, just wanted to share a little success. I had a pimple growing on my cheek and I just left it alone, didn't pop it, nothing. I put my BP cream on it, and last night I mixed a bit of neem oil in with my moisturizer and this morning it was really, really reduced in size and the redness has lessened as well. So yay! I'm just recovering from a pimple I popped on my lip a few days ago that is now an ugly scab...sigh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Current routine:

AM - 

1.) Rinse face with water.

2.) Thayer's Witch Hazel as a toner.

3.) Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion. Wait 10-20 minutes.

4.) Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence. 

5.) Clinique Acne Solutions Emergency Gel Lotion on any active pimples.

6.) Light layer of Cerave in the tub.

7.) Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen spf 30.


PM - 

1.) Makeup remover wipe.
 
2.) OCM with sunflower oil.

3.) Cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser.

4.) Thayer's Witch Hazel.

5.) Alpha Hydrox, 10% Glycolic Acid

6.) Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence.

7.) Clinique Acne Solutions Emergency Gel Lotion on active pimples. 

8.) Cerave in the tub.

9.) Thin layer of Vaseline. 


Questions: 

Can someone check that the order of my products is okay? I recently added in the witch hazel, is it okay to use that twice a day, and do I use it right after cleansing? 

Also, when should I use my Benton Snail Bee? I've been using it after I wait for my AHA or BHA. 

I bought neem oil because I heard it was good for acne. If I use it with sunflower oil as my OCM, will it help with acne? Or do I need to apply it directly to spots? I guess what I'm saying is how do I get the most benefit from it? I've heard people mix it with their moisturizer which I have tried. 

Also, I haven't really noticed any different in my acne since using the BHA and AHA, but I have noticed a definite change in the feel of my skin. Do I just need to keep using them? My skin feels so much nicer, and if I skip my AHA at night I can definitely tell the next day. But as far as appearance goes I don't see a difference. Would it be worth it to try the Paula's choice BHA or AHA? Or are the products I'm using pretty comparable? 

Sorry for the book. I'm trying to be patient with my skin. I take good care of it now, and have been for the past 3 months or so, and other than the feel of my skin I honestly can't tell a difference. If I started incorporating more exercise into my life, would that potentially help my skin? Is there any research to suggest that better fitness helps skin at all? That's one thing I could try along with getting more vitamins in my diet because I eat pretty terrible. 

Thanks for the help!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am considering starting on the pill, but I am a little concerned that the hormonal changes might affect my skin somehow. I have pretty mild acne and I only get really bad pimples during my period. When I used to be on birth control, I don't remember if it made my skin any better but it didn't make it worse. 

However, I'm going to be taking a different brand of pill, so is there any chance it could cause me to break out? What are your experiences with birth control and acne, positive and negative? 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the reason I kept using it was because it was also a lotion and supposedly very hydrating, with the hyaluronic acid in it. So is it still okay to use? I understand I'm not getting any boosted effect. 

Yeah, the sugar will probably be too much for my skin. I'm already doing an AHA and a BHA but I want my skin smoother... Maybe I should just give it time. 

Oh, also, if it's a product, how do I tell which one? I added neem oil and the hado labo sunscreen around the time I started breaking out, but a few weeks before that I introduced sunflower oil. And it's weird because it's only on my temple area!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my routine is:
AM - splash face with water, rapid clear acne defense lotion sa 2%, neutrogena spf 30

PM - Ocm with sunflower oil, Thayers witch hazel as toner, alpha hydrox 10% glycolic acid, wait 30 minutes, benton snail bee high content essence, cerave moisturizer, then dab neem oil on spots, then thin layer of vaseline. 

So I have these spots now on the sides of my face, they seem to be slowly fading but they appeared randomly about a week ago. They're like little bumps, possibly closed comedones but some of then I can wipe away with physical exfoliation. What is this? Would any product have caused that? They appeared near my temples and I never get acne there. For the record I change my pillow case every night and use sulfate free everything. 

Also, I bought Hado Labo sunscreen, thinking it was the lotion everyone talks about (it was heavily discounted) but it's only spf 18. Can I use this in addition to my spf 30? Is it okay to layer sunscreen? I just want to get some use out of it. 

What can I use for physical exfoliation? I have the eco tools konjac sponge but it's not abrasive enough, and the studio beauty konjac sponge is too abrasive so I only use it on my body. I always like the microexfoliant from Dermalogica but it's too expensive for me right now. Can I use brown sugar mixed with water or is that a big no no?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just purchased Thayer's Witch Hazel but I am not sure where to put this in my routine. How do you guys use it? 

Also, how often can I apply a clay mask? The only area I get somewhat oily in is my nose, so I wanted to apply my mint julep mask on my nose more than once a week (also in an effort to reduce my SFs). My routine is below.

So my current routine is as follows:

AM - rinse face, apply Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion with 2% SA, wait 15-30 minutes, then apply Cerave in the tub - if dry - then Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen with spf 30.

PM - OCM with sunflower oil, cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser, then apply Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic acid, wait 30 minutes, apply Benton High Content snail essence (my newest buy!), then I do a mix of neem oil and my cerave moisturizer, then layer with vaseline.

I patch tested everything, introduced one at a time, etc etc. I just started using my neem oil with my moisturizer so I'm excited to see if that helps at all. 

My acne is pretty much at bay (for now), I have one pimple on my lip but I'm doing all the things I can to prevent acne (fresh pillow case every night, SLS-free toothpaste, conquered my obsessive face touching, I don't pick anymore). 

Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's quite textured, more so than a konjac sponge. But it may depend on the brand. I know I have a studio beauty "konjac sponge" that is not really that, and so rough I can't use it on my face - but it's okay on my body. 

Are you sensitive to tea tree oil? I read of someone having success with using a mix of tea tree oil and a carrier oil on their KP. could be worth a shot. 

Other than that, you could try other chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Paula's Choice has a few products made specifically for KP, but I'm not sure on the ingredients. 

Another possibility is neem oil, which is used for some skin conditions like eczema  and I use it for my acne. I have not tried it on my KP but if anything it would be moisturizing. 

I would keep the areas you have KP very very moisturized, and I really love my vaseline intensive care lotion that is fragrance free. And I would try exfoliating the area as much as your skin can tolerate it. Check out exfoliating gloves whenever you're in a drug store next just to get a feel for how the texture is. 

I hope that helps. It gives you a few things to try. I might do a search now for Asian products meant for KP because I'm curious now!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What products have you tried?

For my KP my routine is to exfoliate the area when I shower with some exfoliating gloves (I got mine at Walgreens), and then keeping the area shaved. Then I use Cerave SA Renewing Lotion (I believe that's what it's called... It's got salicylic acid in it). I use this at least once a day. I also use vaseline fragrance free moisturizer and avoid any lotions with fragrance as they can irritate KP. 

So I know none of those are Asian products but I have found this routine to be working. The exfoliating has helped immensely and the lotion from Cerave is quite good. I have also heard the Repair Cream from Paula's Choice, the bha, is also very effective for KP but I haven't tried it myself. 

Apparently more people see improvement with a BHA than an AHA with their KP, so if you wanted to find an Asian product I would look for one that is a BHA or has salicylic acid in it. 

Oh, and tight clothing can aggravate KP, as well as scratching or picking at it, so it's best to wear looser fitting clothes whenever possible. I got all this info from a video on YouTube but I can't remember who it was! I hope that helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My current routine is:

AM - Splash face with water, Neutrogena rapid clear acne lotion with 2% SA, wait around 10-15 minutes, and then neutrogena dry touch sunscreen SPF 30.

PM - Remove makeup with mineral oil or a makeup wipe. Oil cleanse with mix of neem oil and sunflower oil, wipe off with microfiber cloth. If I feel dirty still I will use my Cerave foaming cleanser after the oil cleanse. Then I apply Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic acid and wait 30 minutes. Then I apply my clinique emergency gel with 10% BP on any acne spots and wait 10-15 minutes. Then I apply moisturizer and a layer of vaseline.

I haven't been using the BP as much because it leaves my face so itchy the next day!

My question is if I wanted to use neem oil as a spot treatment how would I do so? Do I put it on before my moisturizer or after? I feel like if I use it before my moisturizer then wouldn't my moisturizer wipe it away? Or do I wait to let the oil sink in?

Also, what is it called when you don't have whiteheads or pimples but it's like hard plugs in my pores? If I pop them they come out as hard bits of I assume sebum or something. If I pop them they go away very quickly but if I don't it feels like they're on my face forever. What can I do about this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I'm pretty much the same way. More stress = more acne. I have pretty bad anxiety so I'm taking medication (I'm taking 50mg of sertaline for anxiety/depression) and it's reduced some stress. 

So my only suggestion is to reduce the anxiety somehow, either through lifestyle changes or medication. Also, you should try to get 8 hours of sleep - I started taking melatonin at night since I sometimes have trouble getting to bed on time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Parents can be super cruel. My mom was like this when I was in high school and for a teenager I had pretty moderate acne. I scrubbed my face so hard after she told me I had gross blackheads on my nose (which turned out to be just sebaceous filaments, which are normal), I was left with just a giant scab on my nose. Ugh. 

Sometimes oil production occurs because you are not moisturizing your face enough. You could try not washing your face in the morning and just using water, then your moisturizer. 

You could also try doing a mask weekly if you aren't already! I really love my Aztec Healing Clay and my Mint Julep mask. Those are both good for oily skin types. 

Good luck, don't let your parents get you down. Keep hanging out with your awesome friends! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My current routine is:

AM - Splash face with water, Neutrogena rapid clear acne lotion with 2% SA, wait around 10-15 minutes, and then neutrogena dry touch sunscreen SPF 30.

PM - Remove makeup with mineral oil or a makeup wipe. Oil cleanse with mix of neem oil and sunflower oil, wipe off with microfiber cloth. If I feel dirty still I will use my Cerave foaming cleanser after the oil cleanse. Then I apply Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic acid and wait 30 minutes. Then I apply my clinique emergency gel with 10% BP on any acne spots and wait 10-15 minutes. Then I apply moisturizer and a layer of vaseline. 

This routine specifically has been used for about 2 weeks, but I have been doing a skin routine similar to this for a couple of months. I included one product at a time and patch tested everything.

My issue is with my PIH. I don't feel like it's fading at all. My acne is generally gone, I only have issues with acne on my jawline that I believe is because I have a problem resting my chin in my hands. My only problem is I have a lot of PIH and it's really frustrating. What else can I do to fade it? I have been using a combo of some kind of AHA and 2% SA for a month or two. 

I have been considering getting a serum, like the super serum from Silk Naturals. Would this help with the PIH?

Also, for my body I am using the SA renewing lotion from Cerave in the morning and then either my Amlactin or my Alpha Hydrox at night to exfoliate and keep my KP at bay. What else can I do for my KP/bumpy skin? How often can I exfoliate my body physically? Thank you!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've tried a couple of things over the years. You could try stretching before you go to bed, or progressive muscle relaxation, which is where you tense muscles individually and then release the tension. You could add in small amounts of exercise during your day, since the idea is that the more tired your body is the easier it will be to sleep.

I also tend to sleep with some kind of video on that I find relaxing. Lately I've been watching Sims 4 house builds! Videos on Soothetube tend to be quite popular. 

I also suggest taking melatonin, which someone else suggested. This also helps if I take it after waking up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. I would also avoid caffeine any time after the morning. 

Good luck. Creating a before sleep "routine" is often helpful as well, because it cues your brain that it's time to sleep - i.e. brushing your teeth, drinking tea, changing into PJs, etc etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the scarring, I would recommend using a chemical exfoliator like an AHA or BHA (you can look in the sidebar for more information). You could also check out the information about PIH, which is the technical term for acne scarring. 

Also, be sure that you are using sunscreen daily because the sun can darken acne scars. 

There's also information on the sidebar about routines for combination skin or oily skin. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it okay to switch up my routine from day to day? All of the products I have used I patch tested and I know they don't break me out, and I introduced them slowly. I basically just switch up the products I use for chemical exfoliation and for treating breakouts. 

Right now I'm interested in fading my PIH and making my skin look more glowy - if that makes sense - so I've looked into some serums like the Silk Naturals Super Serum. Has anyone used this? Does anyone use a serum with Vitamin C and what have the results been like?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would experiment with different oils just because coconut oil can cause breakouts. I would start with mineral oil because it's a good starter oil and see how that goes. 

For dryness, a lot of people on here like to put vaseline or aquaphor on their face after their moisturizer, and I find that keeps my skin very smooth. 

I would definitely read up in the sidebar in routines for dry skin!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So right now this is my basic routine:


AM: Neutrogena Dry Touch sunscreen spf 30, then occasionally Clinique Acne Solutions Emergency Gel-Lotion (BP 10%) if I have spots.


PM: Remove makeup with sunflower oil, then mix neem and sunflower oil together for oil cleansing, then I use Neutrogenas Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion (which has salicylic acid in it), wait around for 10-20 minutes, then Cerave in the tub, then a thin layer of vaseline.

Once a week I do a clay mask.

I did patch test and added everything one at a time, this routine has been a big work in progress!

So my question is, my skin has really been looking a lot better, especially since adding the neem oil. I don't really even get spots anymore and my PIH is fading. However, on the sides of my face I'm noticing bumps, and I don't think they are closed comedones because I can scrub them off. What is that? 

Anyway, I'm also wondering if I should add in physical exfoliation to my routine, and if so, what? I do have a Clarisonic but I don't know if that would be too harsh. Can I just use a washcloth?

Thanks!

Edit: I forgot! I also wanted to ask about sheet masks, because I wanted to try them out. Where can I get them, and what kind should I get? My skin is really normal and not really oily or dry, and I have light acne and PIH. I also heard you can use sheet masks as much as you want, is that true? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think so. According to the website it says cerave is a humectant (I think) and can be drying so following it with an occlusive is a good idea. I thought it was from my BP but I stopped using it and it still happened. So I just put vaseline on top and my lids are much nicer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever I shave my legs they feel very irritated. My skin is bumpy, I believe I have a minor case of KP, and the shaving definitely irritates that. 

My basic shaving routine is to exfoliate with a loofah and the neutrogena body wash with salicylic acid, then I shave using a razor with a fresh new blade and shaving cream. Sometimes I use mineral oil instead but I end up with the same results. After I use my rough and bumpy lotion from gold bonds. 

However my skin still feels like... Depleted and dry and gross. I like having smooth hairless legs but what can I use to really moisturize my legs? 

Any advice is appreciated. </TEXT>

Also, I bought neem oil, how do you guys use it? If I mix it with another oil can I use it on my whole face, even around my eyes? 
Last question, my eyelids get very dry for some reason, and currently I am only washing my face at night using OCM, then using BP, and moisturizing. What would be drying out my eyelids? I don't put moisturizer on my eyes because it makes it worse, but I do use sunflower oil to remove my eye makeup. Is there any kind of moisturizer I could use on my eyes? The skin is really flaky and weird.

<TEXT> I went through something similar. My ex-husband had an affair and also thought I was very useless. And truth be told, I kind of was. I was stuck in a rut, I wasn't happy, I was depressed and anxious and suicidal. Life was bad. 

I can tell you that moving on was the best possible thing for me. You don't need your husband's approval for the things you do, you should do them because you want to. I fell into that same pattern of convincing my ex I was finally going to do something with my life, but I never did. And it was because I was trying to do it for someone else and not me. 

I'm telling you that it is possible to move on and survive post divorce, and to thrive and be happy. It just takes small adjustments and some hard work. It's even pretty thrilling to do stuff just for me. I remember the first time after my separation that I bought a video game. It was awesome! I went to my own apartment and played it for hours without anyone telling me I couldn't. 

Take some time to think about you and what you need. If your husband is seeking the attention of other women he is obviously not happy either. If you are having persistent suicidal thoughts please call someone or go to /r/SuicideWatch. 

Good luck!  </TEXT>

My therapist recommended doing an exercise where I write down what I am thinking while I experience the anxiety. It helped put it into perspective. Then, when I make phone calls, I try to modify that thinking by thinking something positive. 

Also, practice. I started a job where I had to answer phones and I was terrified initially, but after doing it a lot it got easier, and I started to think, who gives a fuck what this person on the other line thinks of me? They don't know me, they don't define me. It gets easier. 

Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is guys do not think that way. You said you weren't into hookups and went to his place, some guys are going to automatically assume you will have sex if you are there, regardless of what was said before. 

Dude was skeevy, and acting inappropriately, yeah. But I highly doubt he was a potential rapist. 

I've been in really similar situations where I went over to a guy's apartment and consistently they assumed sex would be had unless I explicitly told them, I will not fuck you tonight, in those exact words, that bluntly. It's like, I feel like dudes learned from somewhere that women who say no are really just being coy or some shit and sometimes you just need to be blunt.  </TEXT>

I ended up installing Linux alongside Windows 8, and when I boot Linux I can connect to the Internet at work no problem. So I assume the issue is with some Windows configuration? 

At this point if I use my laptop at work I just boot Linux. I assume reinstalling Windows 8 would fix it but I don't know how to do that because I don't have the product key. 

Thanks again for your help!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Morning I splash my face with water, sometimes use stridex pads, followed with sunscreen. 

Night I use Cerave foaming cleanser and alpha Hydrox, then 2.5 BP and Cerave in the tub. 

So I have acne on my chin and neck, not really that much but it's annoying. I don't get acne anywhere else. 

My question is, I just realized I drool a lot in my sleep... Kind of gross. And now that it's getting colder and I have an almost permanent stuffy nose I breathe through my mouth more than normal. Is it possible that... My drool... Is causing acne? Is that a thing? I change my pillow case every night. If it's possible, how do I prevent this without like, saran wrapping my face?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm using an Asus X83V laptop running Windows 8. 

I was able to connect to the internet at work previously, but one day I was unable to connect to the network. I verified I was typing in the correct security key, restarted my computer, forgot the network and then reconnected, but nothing helped. I work in a relatively small office and no other employees were having issues with wireless connectivity. 

I generally have no problems connecting to the wireless internet at home, but sometimes it will disconnect me from the network. At that point I have to restart my computer to get it to reconnect again, I'm not sure if that issue is related. However, I'm always able to connect to the internet again after restarting. Not so with the internet at work.

So today I found we had some wireless adapters laying around, the one I used is a Linksys AE6000. I plugged it into my laptop and used that wireless to connect to the network and it worked. So...I'm connected but it irritates me that I don't know why. Is my laptop's network card failing? What is the reason this would be happening?

Thank you for your help!

<TEXT> AM: Rinse face, Stridex pad, 2.5% BP on acne (all on chin and neck), apply Neutrogena sunscreen, then makeup.

PM: Remove makeup with mineral oil, Cerave foaming cleanser, Alpha Hydrox, wait 30 minutes, 2.5% BP on acne, wait about 10 minutes, then Cerave in the tub.

I have been doing this routine for about 2 weeks, was doing the same routine minus the Alpha Hydrox for about a month and a half.

I did include one product at a time.

My issue is I have this breakout on my neck. I have never, ever in my entire life had a breakout on my neck. It's really nasty and all concentrated in one area, only on the left side of my neck. Oddly, I only ever seem to get acne on the left side of my face. Around my lip, and chin, and now neck, but on the left side only. What's the deal? I'm super frustrated about this breakout because wth, neck acne was never a problem. It's itchy and red, and some of the pimples are white. I stopped wearing makeup as of yesterday. 

The only thing I am thinking is the Alpha Hydrox, because I do tend to bring it down on my neck if I've put too much on. Would this cause acne to come out on my neck? I'm just frustrated because even when I was sleeping in my makeup and not ever washing my face I had zero issues with neck acne. Any help is super appreciated.  </TEXT>

I've been doing this routine with some minor changes (added in the AHA a week and a half ago) for about two months. 

Problems:

I always have at least one pimple in my lip area. It drives me nuts. I dont really get pimples anywhere but my lips and chin. What's up with that? I read that my lipstick could cause it, so I only put vaseline on my lips. Same problem. 

Also, I have a lot of bumps and redness on my chin and neck. It feels pretty smooth but I can see the bumps and it looks pretty wonky. Is there a reason I only seem to have acne issues on my chin and neck? 

Last problem, my eyes are always dry. My left eye in particular, it is like, scaly and flaky and weird looking where I would put eyeshadow. I put this eye cream on it from Lancome and it hasn't really help. How can I better moisturize that area?

Thanks for the help!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can I post about my skin on my arms and legs? 

Right now I'm troubleshooting with reducing the bumpy redness on my legs mostly. I was told it's probably KP, so I bought the new gold bonds lotion for bumpy and rough skin.

In the morning I use a salicylic acid body wash (I think a Walgreens brand product) on my arms and legs, then I use a regular gold bonds moisturizer or sunscreen. Then at night I use the gold bonds KP lotion. 

I have been doing this for about three weeks. Basically my skin is crazy smooth but it still looks red and bumpy. What else can I try here? It isn't super noticeable but I'm paranoid about it and want nice skin! 

Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you on my fitness pal? I have a ton of friends on there from this sub and the main keto sub and it helps keep me motivated. Family and friends all know about my diet and support me, and keep me in line (my dad, for example, the annoying person that he is, called me out for indulging in a bite of a cream puff over the weekend).

Other than positive support from peers and online, you need to be able to motivate yourself. Keep a list of why you are doing keto on your fridge. Don't go anywhere you may be tempted to eat carbs. Only keep healthy food in the house. Experiment with keto cooking and find ways to satisfy your cravings - if I want something sweet I make fat bombs and if I want pizza I make an almond flour pizza crust. 

The other thing is don't knock yourself for making mistakes. Eat an oreo? Who cares, continue keto from that point on. If you feel guilty about it, it usually makes you want to binge on carbs all day. Learn to pick yourself up immediately after making a mistake. 

I hope that helps!

I think I avoided those things before not because I was so "above" them but because focusing on my appearance depressed me. Now that I'm trying to be healthier I find a ton of girly enjoyment out of shopping and yesterday I even got a haircut and waxed my brows haha!

<TEXT> Do you think a lot of it has to do with pressure from other people? Especially since you have issues as the day goes on. I know I wanted to cheat and told my boyfriend we should get pizza. He isn't in charge of my diet so he said okay, and for a minute I felt like he had validated my decision to cheat, do you know what I mean? I ended up feeling bad and we didn't get pizza, because I need to hold myself accountable. But there were definitely times in the past when I allowed myself unhealthy food because I was out with friends or family. It's hard to feel in control I think when everyone else is eating crappy!  </TEXT>

I also just started dating someone seriously (the first relationship I've had after my divorce) and I have no idea what I'm doing. Ahh!

<TEXT> I would use the keto calculator in the side bar and only put in a small calorie deficit. When I started, I had a calorie limit of 1600, which was good for me because I was full enough despite still having cravings. Now I eat around 1200-1400, sometimes more if I want to indulge. 

What kind of foods do you eat? If I find myself hungry I usually eat a handful of almonds or I make fat bombs. The large amount of fat makes my stomach happy and I am way less likely to binge. I still track everything to be sure I'm under my carb limit. 

Good luck. I tried keto a few times before but only recently did I start it and stick to it without cheats. It might take a few runs to figure it all out.  </TEXT>

I planned meals so that I wouldn't cheat and made sure I was drinking enough water. 

Honestly, there will always be reasons not to do keto. There will never be a perfect time to start. Might as well just dive right in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally awesome transformation.

I've been on keto for about 3 weeks, no big slip ups. I simply feel better. I used to emotionally eat and now I do not. I had bad anxiety and could not sit still, now that I am eating low carb I am so much more calm. So basically, those things push me to stay doing keto. I feel better, therefore, why would I want to stop doing it? You need to find your own personal reasons to keep going!

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I'm on week three of keto and day 1 seems like it was yesterday! Seriously, keto is the least diet-y diet I have ever been on and I love all the awesome food I can eat (MEAT lol). 

One thing that helped me immensely was my fitness pal, if you don't have one get one, because I have tons of friends from /r/keto and /r/xxketo. You should add me, my username is sperhauk on there (and anyone else can add me as well). It's nice to have a lot of internet buddies holding you accountable and inspiring you! 

I read something on /r/GetMotivated that said something like, you already know what it's like to give in. What would it feel like to keep going? That inspires me so much. 

I also don't have a huge budget to go on when it comes to keto so bulk buying foods (especially meat) and planning meals goes a long way into saving money!  </TEXT>

My depression usually makes me say "I can't" to myself, so sticking to keto helps me fight that feeling. As for my anxiety, I could barely sit still before keto. Now I feel so much more calm and relaxed, and I barely ever have mood swings.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you know when you're looking down at your phone and the screen turns off and you are met with a reflection of your face? And then if you're like me you get depressed because you realize just how much fat appears under your chin?

WELL after two weeks on keto I SWEAR it's gotten noticeably smaller! I thought, maybe I'm holding the phone higher than usual. But I moved it around and still, my chin fat has totally shrunk haha.

This is an awesome victory for me because the fat face in phone reflection occurrence was one of my wake up calls I needed to lose weight! Sooo yeah things are going pretty good.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I am very sensitive to body sensations, for example, being too hot or too cold makes me anxious, or being sick, or having any kind of pain. Especially when my heart rate increases or I feel flushed. I have basically been trying to avoid being in the sun or doing any kind of physical activity. 

BUT I know that exercise helps anxiety. So for the past few days I have been getting up super early to go for a walk and jog a bit, so that I won't get too hot and I stop if I get panicky because of my heart rate. Well today I went for an awesome jog after work, the sun was shining, and there were (gasp) even people around where I was running, and I WAS FINE. I had some anxious moments, especially immediately post run when I started focusing on my heart beat, but I am calm now I feel just awesome. 

I know I have a ways to go with my anxiety but this is the first time I ever really said fuck you to my anxious feelings and just did something good for myself! </TEXT>

Anyway, I only recently finalized the divorce and seeing happy couples still annoys me. It's hard for me not to belt out to girls HES PROBABLY CHEATING ON YOU. Cause I'm bitter, I said it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it's never the skinny healthy relatives, it's always the overweight or obese ones. Like do you hate your life that much that you need to resort to criticizing other peoples' weights. I think they believe they get a pass because they're old and I'm young, and young girls "should" be thin. Whatever! 

The same birthday party my uncle asked me if I was a lesbian. Just out of the blue. Like wtf. Who ASKS that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a communication breakdown here. She clearly does not want you running with this girl. Has she explained that to you? What she's doing is punishing you for running with this girl in an effort to get you to stop, when she should just explain how it makes her feel.

If she did something similar with a guy, how would you feel? If she point blank asked you to stop running with the girl, would you?

A lot of people in the thread are calling her a bitch and a jealous cunt and I really feel like it's unfair. Every relationship has to deal with jealousy to some extent. You need to talk to her about this.  </TEXT>

1.) She doesn't realize feminist is not the same as feminine.

2.) She believes feminism's goal is to feminize men or make them more like women.

3.) She actually understands feminism but doesn't agree with it, and believes it makes men less masculine.

He would be confused, say that I didn't look anxious, and proceed to continue doing whatever we were doing in public (shopping or whatever). Then I would say, I need to leave, I'm leaving, and he would get all butthurt and claim I used my anxiety as an excuse to not spend time with him. Sigh. Hence the ex part. </TEXT>

My advice is to throw yourself into something to keep your mind off of things. I bought a bunch of video games because when I was married I never, ever spent any money on myself, and at night if I was feeling alone I'd throw myself into a game. Also I drank a lot of rum. Things will get better :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does feel like people who are overweight get this bad rap of being a grumpy person. Or, if an overweight person happens to be grumpy that day it's all of a sudden, well, she's grumpy cause she's fat. It's kind of bullshit. 

It just makes no sense the amount of hatred people can spew over someone's freakin' weight. Like I went on /r/fatpeoplehate and was just floored. People waste time over this? 

Not to even mention the double standard of fat dudes vs. fat chicks. Like one of the friends I was hanging out with was an overweight dude, and even he was getting in on it. No one gives a shit if a guy is overweight, and if the overweight dude can't get chicks, it's because girls are shallow, but if an overweight girl can't get dudes it's her fault because she's fat.

<TEXT> Thanks for the advice. My divorce pushed me in a lot of ways to put myself out there and socialize more. I had so much anxiety initially, especially when going on dates, but now I'm noticing that's subsiding which is a huge relief. I'd like to get back to the point where I only had situational anxiety. 

I think you're right about finding a guy who isn't depressed. My ex fed off of my moods and would be down when I was down, and it wasn't helpful. 

I find that when I get depressed, my body and brain tell me to lay in bed to make it feel better. My strategy now is to get out and do things, to fake it, like you said. This has helped me a lot. It's hard to fight against that feeling though. A mantra for me had basically become "I can't" so I think in many ways my fight now is to just convince myself that I can.  </TEXT>

It makes it hard to date because honestly I don't even know who I am without my depression. I get down on myself thinking no one wants to be with a girl who has depression. And even if I meet a great guy I think eventually he won't like me because of my issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminds me of a guy I knew once who was married and had a ton of affairs with women he met online. His wife found out about it and decides to sleep with one guy for revenge. Husband goes ballistic and kicks her out. His excuse was that "it's different for men, men never get over infidelity."

Like dude, you were banging 10&#177; chicks behind your wife's back. God that guy was a piece of shit.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [F4F]24, Milwaukee - Looking for new girl friends </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey! I'm looking for new friends to hang out with. I recently got divorced and realized how little friends I have. I'd love to hang out with other women who are redditors and have similar interests. 

I don't mind if you're attached, but I'm single so I would love to go out with someone to meet guys! I'm looking to just have fun at this point in my life. 

I want to get outside more and do active things but I don't know a lot of people. I like hiking, exploring, geocaching, etc. I love beer and trying new kinds, exploring different bars and restaurants. 

Hope to hear from you! </TEXT>

My ex was very controlling and would get mad at me if I went out with friends, guy or girl. So I stopped. After five years of being together I had dwindled all of my friends down to one. It sucked.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> None of this sounds normal honestly, or healthy. He sounds like he is insecure and wants to control your life by being emotionally manipulative. 

It might be mild now, but what happens if in the future he asks you to stop hanging out with your guy friend altogether? He doesn't sound like he has YOUR interests in mind at all. 

Personally, having had experience with this type of guy, I would get out of that relationship. In my experience these guys only get worse over time.  </TEXT>

The other big factor for me was that they didn't use a condom. So they risked pregnancy and stds. They risked my health. All to have an affair. It's just gross.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a period of about a week after finding out about it that I was still weighing my options. I asked him some details about the affair (instead of coming clean he lied about a lot of the details and hid the fact that it happened multiple times rather than once), he looked at me, disgusted, and said, "When are you going to get over this?" 

I realized then that he did not realize how much he had hurt me, and he never would. He would never be the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I made my decision and I'm happy about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly it's quite complicated. There are a lot of details about the cheating that I won't go into online. But it was a combination of factors that led me to my decision. Why he cheated, who he cheated with, where he cheated, how many times it happened, what he thought while he was cheating, did he have remorse or guilt after before I knew about it. 

Then there is family and how they responded. My mom, who I'm close to, was livid. She said I could never bring him to her house ever again. Word spread throughout the family and everyone despised him. I would never be able to bring him to Christmas without it being a huge awkward moment for all of us. I regret telling my mother now, but maybe it was for the best. It is important to me that my family love and respect the man I am with, and that wasn't true anymore. 

In addition to that, it was how I was feeling in the marriage prior to the cheating. I was massively depressed and never felt like I could rely on him for anything. We were both starting to realize how little we had in common. We went to therapy, and realized how terrible we were at communicating with each other. Honestly it was a mess before the cheating. 

Despite any of that, for whatever reason, finding out he cheated was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. And I'm thankful my life is good enough that getting cheated on (so far) is the worst thing to happen to me. But it's hard to explain why it hurts so much. I don't think I really have an answer for you. 

Some nights I feel lucky I was cheated on because it gave me the courage to leave a marriage I wasn't happy in. So I don't know. We were both unhappy. But it's hard to really be honest with yourselves in a marriage when things aren't working.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it was a lot of reasons, I could write a book about it honestly. Let me just say this, I am divorced now and my sex drive has returned. 

I think it was mainly one, I was severely depressed, for whatever reason. I would literally not self lubricate and so sex was painful. Two, I just wasn't attracted to him anymore. He was really emotionally manipulative, incredibly jealous and would get upset if I went anywhere without him. Three, we were never really sexually compatible to begin with. I love dominant guys, he loved dominant girls. See the problem? 

Lots of reasons. Mainly issues of compatibility. If I could go back I would never have gotten married. I was young and dumb and believed in true love and soul mates.  </TEXT>

There were other problems, sure. But we were not sexually compatible and I was young and didn't realize how important that is. 

Could you see yourself only having sex with your girlfriend once a week? Twice a month? Once every few months?

<TEXT> I would call myself a feminist and totally believe she should have been charged with assault at the least. She should absolutely be charged with lying to police. 

I don't think statements about the patriarchy are meant to direct attention away from women being perpetrators of violence. My understanding is that the idea that women are weak and cannot be violent against men is a huge problem, because it allows people like this to get away with assault. But the issue here lies with the fact that police will not believe a man if he says he is assaulted. And why is that? I don't believe it has anything to do with modern feminism making women out to be victims. 

Basically we need to look at solutions. How do we protect both men and women in situations of assault? We need to teach police officers that women are capable of violence so they can be more objective about situations, ie if a dude has bruises and scratch marks and the woman looks fine, don't arrest the GUY. I had a good friend of mine get arrested and was charged with assault, then had to go to AA meetings because his drunk girlfriend decided to have a meltdown and start throwing shit at him and beating him up at a party. He was embarrassed so he didn't tell anyone what was going on until a neighbor called the cops. Dude had a gash on his face because she threw a lamp at him and he got arrested. 

It's just frustrating because I am a feminist and this issue is personal to me. Hope you see where I'm coming from! Regardless of what labels you choose to put on yourself I think we all agree this is a problem (except a few extremists maybe).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, he believes that it is the cause of a lot of problems. Feminism got rid of traditional families for the most part, and so family units aren't as strong with women in the work force. That's just one thing he talks about. I think it's very interesting.

What bothers me about his beliefs is mainly his idea that women are unempathetic predators, who will screw up your life on purpose, take all of your money, and sucker you into children. He doesn't believe women can be monogamous, they are always searching for something better even when they marry. It's very odd considering no women in our family fit that description at all. So who are these mysterious sperm jacking predator women? I'll have to ask him that next time I see him!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think over the years he has become more entrenched, yes. I think the longer he goes without a woman in his life the more he buys into these beliefs. I want him to find a girl. Despite his beliefs he is very family oriented and wants a very traditional family. I personally believe he goes about it in the wrong way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother buys into all of that. He's incredibly intelligent though, so sometimes when I have a talk with him, just me and him, we have rational discussions about feminism, life, women, dating, etc. I think he is into most of it for the shock value.

He still believes feminism is destroying our culture. And I can't change that. I think the best thing to do is to just voice your opinions on it if he brings it up. But if he inevitably decides to keep thinking the way that he does, you can't change that. 

My brother will always be a bit of an oddball but in the end he's my brother. He treats me and my mom with respect (most of the time, anyway). I think he's just going through a hard time because he's had bad experiences with women. He was with a girl once who ended up having a fiance the whole time they saw each other. So I try to listen to him and help him see my way of thinking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cheating was what pushed me to file for divorce, but it was basically a culmination of selfish behaviors on his part. We struggled with a lot. We got married very young and we jumped right into it, we never lived together to figure out each others personalities better before marrying. 

Now that I think about it we weren't very compatible. I just wish we would have realized that and parted ways before he cheated. It hurts quite a lot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I've said before, at that point he should have filed for divorce. I'm not sure why people keep saying "what did I expect him to do." 

Cheating is never acceptable. There is a mature way of dealing with sexual incompatibility. I didn't want sex constantly, that is true, but I never stopped loving my husband. I did everything for him, except force myself to be sexual when I couldn't be. In the end he decided constant sex was more important than being with the woman he loved. It was unfortunate. 

I never needed sex in my relationship with him. I was totally fulfilled in other ways. I just wish we had realized that before we got married. I don't blame him for needing sex. But I do feel emotionally damaged from the betrayal. It still keeps me up at night knowing the only one who claimed to love me has hurt me the most in this world. Anyway, thanks for your input.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were times when sex didn't happen at all. But I did try very hard. When the sex didn't happen it was generally because he was very insensitive about it. He'd get upset with me and say a man can only handle rejection so many times. I'm not sure what the right way to handle any of it was.

But you are right about jumping to conclusions about my ex being an ass. There are two sides to every story, and the truth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's interesting that you make the assumption that I did nothing. I never made that statement. 

I was clinically depressed. That hurt our marriage and our sex life. I saw therapists and doctors, took four different kinds of medication. I lost weight, ate healthier, exercised. We had sex. It wasn't every day, but we had it. I tried very hard. So when I read someone saying that I did nothing, even on the Internet, it hurts. 

He told me even after my efforts it wasn't enough. He needed sex every day, he needed me to be wet for him, which is something I couldn't do. My body just wasn't responsive. I could give blowjobs. But he didn't want that. 

I asked him why he stayed married to me if it was such a problem. He said he loved me, wanted to see me through it all. But in the end he was wrong. He needed constant sex to validate himself. 

I hope you understand my situation more. Maybe in the future you can not jump to conclusions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's pretty unfair. I had my own issues. I couldn't get physically aroused, and so when we had sex it was extremely painful. 

Regardless of what happened, cheating is not the response to a problem. If he felt we were sexually incompatible he should have left. 

I don't need validation from people on the Internet. I just hope eventually you learn to look at people with more empathy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can understand what you are saying. But I think a lot of your emotions are misplaced. But maybe that's based on my general ignorance on the topic of fat acceptance. I don't believe overweight people want society to start telling them they are healthy, or society to say, it's okay, it's out of your control. I think they just want empathy. I also think they want it to be socially acceptable for people to be overweight, in that people look at it as a lifestyle choice rather than a fault in their moral character. 

Now, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I don't believe you are morally worse because you are obese. If I see an obese person I admit I do believe they have an emotional problem that makes them eat to excess. And maybe that's wrong, I don't know. I don't think anyone chooses to be overweight as a lifestyle. Why would you? But maybe they just want others to stop shaming them. 

I think, especially on Reddit, we make a lot of assumptions about someone's character if they are overweight. Lazy and stupid come to mind. And we make those types of comments even when the person's weight isn't the focus of a post. We take pictures of fat people and mock them. Just for existing and being overweight. And I think that's wrong. 

It's a complicated issue and I'll stop rambling now haha. Thanks for replying to me. I find a lot of the time on here I want to have a discussion with someone who has an opinion different from mine but it usually never happens! So thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hm. I guess I still don't see how you believe she is blaming you. She's coming off as defensive and I don't believe she is right when she says you cannot tell someone is healthy or not by looking at them. 

But I don't believe she blames anyone for her actions. She's upset that, in her mind, people want to make it a moral obligation to be thin. Or she calls it healthism, for whatever reason. And I agree that would not be a good thing. 

I guess what rubs me the wrong way about all of this fat shaming stuff is that people seem absolutely, insanely furious that some people would be fat and deny that they had any part in becoming fat. Now, I don't have statistics on this, but I do not think most overweight people truly believe they are not responsible in some way for being overweight. For the few that do, what's the big deal? A relative of mine claims he can't control himself when he drinks to excess. I roll my eyes. 

I mean, where does the anger originate? Are you worried that suddenly being fat will become acceptable and we'll all eat ourselves to extinction? Because I think right now there is still overwhelming social pressure to be thin. And I can't see that changing.  </TEXT>
