<TEXT> If they're gonna do more Felicity-centric episodes, please leave romance out of it. Face her off against another hacker or explain who her dad is. Don't shove this Olicity bullshit down our throats. You've made so many improvements, Diggle gets a costume, Oliver is becoming the fun loving not-so-dark Green Arrow (to silence the Batman critics), we've got Speedy, and Star City. Please don't ruin all the endless possibilities with more Olicity, keep their romance on the down-low, make it subtle. Last season they were episodes where over 50% of it was Olicity romance and/or Felicity being emotional </TEXT>

But she said she really wants to work on the strong female roles and Diggle. I think the show has always done well with Diggle but I have hope that we can see a Season 1/2-ish Felicity or an even better Felicity this season, and Laurel will finally be as badass as Sara.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is not only a question for me, but if anyone has the same question, I think we should all help each other out with it.

andnbsp;

My fanfiction is about the tv series Arrow and The Flash (I guess Supergirl as well), where would be the best place to post this, I don't think Wattpad would be good because it's most popular fanfics are like One Direction stuff. I think you can keep updating your fanfic on FFnet and can release it in chapters. But I don't know if you can post pictures in your story like on AO3. I'm just really confused as to where to post it. I want to use AO3 but can I post my story chapter by chapter? and keep going back to edit it? Without it expiring?

I know my question was all over the place -.-" </TEXT>

* "I guess from now on, I'll be watching you pee"
* "My secret identity is his black driver"
* "You know, Oliver, somebody once told me that secrets have weight. The more you keep, the harder it is to keep moving."
* "Felicity, I don't think there's a force on earth that can make you a bad person."
* "Things are as good now as ever will be Oliver. And you love her. You even told her so." ... (Oliver: "I was trying to fool Slade.") ... "Yes, except now the only person you're fooling is yourself."

**Currently my favourite Diggle Quote**:

* " I don't know. For the first time since I met Oliver Queen I don't know what happens next. I know it's silly, but I still like to think of myself as Oliver's bodyguard. I just couldn't protect him. It's funny. He was worried something would happen to me."

<TEXT> Well I googled synonyms of supernatural and got superhuman, so I would say Mirakuru is supernatural.

andnbsp;

**Supernatural**: unable to be explained by science or the laws of nature : of, relating to, or seeming to come from magic, a god, etc. 

I'm pretty sure Mirakuru falls under "unable to be explained by science or the laws of nature", at least to the real world, which pre-The Flash TV, Arrow is basically in. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In this video(scene), Oliver says "Those 5 years that I was away..I came across things that just...defy..explanation." 

Is it possible Hal Jordan became the Green Lantern before or around the time Oliver was away from Starling City? Is it possible he means the Green Lantern, because so far the only supernatural thing we've seen, is Slade (with the Mirakuru ofcourse). What do you guys think he meant? Do you think the producers had a plan when writing this scene.

<TEXT> I'll rate the seasons in terms of rappers.

* Season 1 = J Cole / Great for a start, had some flaws but overall enjoyable
* Season 2 = 2Pac (or Biggie or Eminem) / The greatest of them all, Manu Bennett's performance was amazing, and the character development in past and present day was astounding
* Season 3 = B.o.B / Definitely had it's good moments, has it's haters, and has it's lover, good overrall, not perfect, but good... like Banana Bread compared to Cheesecake... good but not quite there

andnbsp;

Edit: I shouldve used desserts instead of rappers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because he's joking about how similar Green Arrow is to Batman.

andnbsp;

Unfortunately, he doesn't know that they share villains.

* Merlyn (Green Arrow villain)
* Deathstroke (Green Arrow/Batman/Teen Titans villain
* The Huntress (Anti-hero, not a villain really of Green Arrow, but brought into the story because.... Black Canary, Birds of Prey, etc.
* Brother Blood (Not even a Batman villain, Teen Titans villain.)
* Brick (Green Arrow Villain)
* Cyrus Gold (Solomon Grundy pre-zombie, is a Green Arrow villain post-crisis)
* Deadshot (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but has faced him in Animated TV Shows, and his daughter lives in Star City)
* Ra's Al Ghul (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but Merlyn is affiliated with the League of Assassins, so it was fine to introduce him into Arrow... in fact if it wasn't for Merlyn, the League would probably never have been involved with the story, except some snippets of Sara Lance here and there.)
* The Clock King (Green Arrow villain.)
* Cupid (Green Arrow Villain.)
* Brother Eye (More of a JLA villain... which Green Arrow is a part of.)
* Count Vertigo (Green Arrow and Batman shared villain.)
* Firefly (Batman villain.)
* KGBeast (Not a villain.... yet. But a Batman villain.)
* Dollmaker (Batman Villain.)

___

andnbsp;

Consensus: The only true Batman-exclusive villains on Arrow are Firefly, Dollmaker, and Deadshot, we have yet to see Anatoli Knyazev's story, assuming they'll cover the whole Russian Bratva thing in the flashbacks. </TEXT>

andnbsp;

I doubt they would... but it would be cool, to mention him in the future, or tease him in an alternate universe on The Flash, of course, they could still show a guy in the suit and mask, you don't need Manu Bennett for everything Deathstroke concerned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It upsets me that when you search for fanfiction on Wattpad, all you get is something about One Direction or another boy band or YouTuber. Whatever happened to things like idk Spongebob meets Jimmy Neutron, or Avengers vs Justice League, or something that takes a character from a book/tv show/movie and expands their story? What also upsets me, is that if it's not about 1D/YouTubers/etc., it's about Twilight or some movie/show and it always focuses on romance.

<TEXT> First off, we know that H.I.V.E., Damien Darhk, and some more Diggle stuff will be covered in Season 4. But lets look at all of the things they haven't covered. 


(Feel free to give me more things to add to this list in the comments below.)

andnbsp;

* There's no way the China White (Chien Na Wei) story is over
* We've barely seen Komodo
* We haven't seen Onomatopoeia
* Slade Wilson and Digger Harkness were former ASIS members and are both imprisoned on Lian Yu... coincidence?
* More Katana?
* If Oliver meets Hal Jordan or anyone else in Coast City in Season 4, I don't think their relationship will only last 1 season
* Oliver's child
* Merlyn Al Ghul :o
* Though I doubt they'll show this, Lyla Michaels has powers in the comics.
* What if they finally get Blue Beetle on here
* More Diggle/Felicity villains
* I hope to see more Brick
* I can't believe they kinda threw this character away but hopefully there's some way to bring him back, Constantine Drakon
* Jake Simmons/Deathbolt was in Opal City when the particle accelerator went off (Probably will be covered in The Flash though)
* Roy Harper, what's gonna happen with him, will he ever be able to come back to Starling City
* Starling City officially becoming Star City?
* Sara is back, Quentin Lance reaction to that?
* Cyrus Gold.... Solomon Grundy? o_o
* The Huntress ?

Okay, that's all I've got for now

* Russian mafia flashbacks
* Raisa, the maid from Season 1.
* Thea meeting Barry. </TEXT>

I'm fine with Olicity to an extent, I personally loved those scenes where Felicity would say something inappropriate to Oliver then have an awkward pause, or the "You're my partner", "When you are there (Central City)&#8230; it just made me realise how much I need you here.", and "You'll always be my girl, Felicity" scenes. They just need to learn how to balance the romance and the action. So it's not full on Twilight love story, or not full-on beating up bad guys, like *cough* [This edit of TDKR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J72GOv3G738) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hal Jordan will appear. Maybe not as Green Lantern, but just as Hal.

But they mentioned a pilot going missing on The Flash? Maybe he appears as a normal human in the flashbacks? or an alternate universe where ever Barry went.

andnbsp;

Also what about Slade Wilson, Walter Steele, Joe Wilson, or expanding on the story of Oliver's child.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted earlier that I was rewatching some of Season 2, and in Ep2x16 "Suicide Squad", when they're all talking to eachother and getting in position, they called John Diggle "Freelancer" and on the DC wikia (i know that's not anything official but) when you go to [John Diggle] (http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/John_Diggle_%28Arrow%29) and look under aliases, you see Freelancer, and it links to [this villain](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Freelance), it also says he's an enemy of this superhero named Triumph, so maybe Triumph will be introduced? Also off-topic, but Lyla Michaels in the comics is Harbinger who has some connection to Supergirl, so just a heads up on  possible future crossovers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm hoping that maybe Roy Harper is pulling a Malcolm Merlyn. Maybe sometime in Season 5, the police agree with The Green Arrow and they get the news that Roy Harper faked his death and he's welcomed back to the probably renamed 'Star City' by Ray Palmer. 

Also, my thoughts for main villains to prolong the series.

Season 4 - Damien Darhk

Season 5 - More H.I.V.E. stuff/Return of Deadshot

Season 6 - Deathstroke back(will appear in both previous seasons in smaller roles)

Season 7 - Merlyn

Season 8 - Chien Na Wei

<TEXT> I have an account on Wattpad (and fanfiction.net, but anyways.) I'm writing a story about the shows 'The Flash' and 'Arrow', basically my version of how they will go on after Arrow Season 3 and Flash Season 1. Is it considered a fan-fiction? Because every time I look at a list of fan-fictions, it's always about some teenage girl meeting Harry Styles or about Harry Potter and Hermione's love life, and I never see regular adventure or horror or crime or science fiction stories, it's always romance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like that theory, this show is about the origins and the journeys of many heroes/villains, (e.g. Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Black Canary, Deadshot, still kind wish they had Sara league of assassins flash backs to show her time away from Starling, but maybe that will be a spin off series.) If Deathstroke got his suit, and Green Arrow got his beard at the end of the 5 years, then I don't see why we can't see [this Deadshot](http://i.imgur.com/wFN7pMK.png) plus it's a metal suit, maybe (just my theory) Ray Palmer invents a fire resistance flak jacket for him, and he joins Team Arrow for a couple episode, but ultimately returns to his villainy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help for a VFX noob -.-" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-06 12:20:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> alright, well I'm complete noob to all this stuff, I'm only good for making little sports mixes and all that easy stuff, what I would like to know is.

* Can Sony Vegas (Pro 13 if it matters) do this cool VFX stuff I'm seeing you guys post?
* Is there a program that's free that allows me to do all that cool VFX stuff? (If Sony Vegas can't)
* Are there any tutorials you would recommend me watch?

Hopefully, this kind of post is allowed here, if not please direct me to the right subreddit to ask.

EDIT: the word "stuff" counter: 4 times :P

<TEXT> The Trade:

* Cavs get Iman Shumpert(NYK) and JR Smith(NYK)
* Thunder get Dion Waiters(CLE)
* Knicks get Lance Thomas(OKC), Louis Amundson(CLE), and Alex Kirk(CLE)

Knicks also waived Samuel Dalembert.

Thoughts on this, will we have to make change to compete with them next season? </TEXT>

<TEXT> wow, I've always loved watching video edits and things like that, and I got into making little sports mixes on youtube, but I've always been interested in VFX and how it works, im only 17 so idk if my parents would pay for software to edit like that, I was able to get Sony Vegas Pro 13 for free online, but anyways, I just want to say what you posted has definitely inspired me to really give vfx a chance, is there any free software that allows me to do this, and also any recommendations on books or youtube videos on how to learn vfx? </TEXT>

I was really liking how Leo and Kara were turning out after their relationships ended or whatever you want to considered it, and I really want to know what happened to Emma.

(I like them all, so it doesn't matter which one you choose.)

I guess /r/NBA or /r/basketball are similar.

You should promote me because, I think shot blocking is becoming a lost art in the NBA, and defense should be appreciated more, plus i have no subscribers :'(. </TEXT>

The Term "cri evrytiem" is commonly used in YouTube video when

My Alien Pet ::
Name :: Jerome (pronounced Jay-Roh-May)

My pet is the Realest nigga alive, and non-humans ain't even considered niggas, but that's what makes Jerome unique.
You see in 1993, Jerome landed on a planet called Kintekai, it was the land of Fried Chicken! Jerome lived there for 21 years. On November 4th 2014, Jerome appeared in my room, he was tall, muscular, looked like a human, and had real nigga traits, he had a high top fade, 8 pack natural abs, and he would sweat grape drink, not grape juice, grape drink. Anyways, Jerome didn't introduce himself to me like a normal alien (e.g. "I come in peace."), instead he(at least I'm assuming it a he, due to his name and appearance), introduced himself like this: "Yo Dawg, is you Timothy?" To which I responded..."Yes, but my parents are asleep please keep it down", he then proceeded to say: "Nah, nigga, don't worry b, only you can hear me, infact, you can respond to me, using your thots, I mean thoughts, I was sent from the planet Kintekai, to be your pet, but I don't play dat homo sh** mayne, no offensive to gays, but by pet, I don't mean no intimate stuff, iight my nigga?"...I said "lol...alright"(yes I actually said 'LOL') then we played some 2k, and then I checked reddit and saw this...so yeah. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember commented on a Lakers post about Julius Randle.
As a Pacers fan, I understand what it feels to have multiple players injured (george, west, hill, watson). 
But if you saw how Roy Hibbert played (22pts 8reb 7blk), i can guarantee you, someone will step up, whether it be Ibaka, or like you said Perry Jones, someone will. I'm sorry for your lost, and  I don't really understand how bad it might feel, playing in a strong West Conf.
But nevertheless, I wish you guys the best on your season. </TEXT>

I believe Julius Randle has the potential to not only be a perennial all star, but the face of the Lakers franchise down the road.

2005-06 B.Wallace: 7.3ppg 11.3rpg 2.2bpg

<TEXT> i still say its worth it, im just pissed off with that fact that i cant use VC on MyCAREER cuz it doesnt connect to 2K Sports server, so idk if i can play crews or myplayer blacktop anymore.

it doesnt say i cant play it, it just says offline MyCAREER means using Skill points instead of VC..

i hope i can still play blacktop online or crews if i ever find people to make one </TEXT>

<TEXT> (i own a ps3 copy of the game)

only graphic changes are Nick Young's hair, Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler have mini afros, and Chandler Parsons looks real for once, they still haven't given Steve Nash the hair he's had for so long now, since he joined LA (2k13).

and the 2k sports servers are retarded.
every time it autosaves its supposedly "retrieving your files from the 2k Sports Server" for like 50 seconds

and when i create a MyCAREER, it says im unable to connect to the 2k Sports Server so i either play offline MyCAREER or get sent back to the main screen with KD on it. 

Then when i go to load the MyCAREER, instead of letting me go to edit my player/play game/look at my player, it sends me back to play the **Rookie Showcase**

When looking for a match online the game stays at 
**HEAD-TO-HEAD**
**Searching for matches...**
until you cancel it.

2K Heroes mode also doesnt work because...you cant match up with anyone to play online.

MyTEAM is undergoing maintenance.
Wait...hold on, im trying right now
it'll be a while since its **RETRIEVING DATA OF WHATEVER FOR 3 HOURS**

*takes chill pill*

alright, im making a team, since i cant make a MyCAREER....actually maybe i'll check out MyCAREER and see if it works, now that MyTEAM works.
i named myTEAM the Toronto Lynxes...cuz apparently the "Lynx" is native to toronto, or something like that.

My starting lineup is Canaan, Rivers, Joe Harris, Jeremy Evans, and Sims

OH look i can play someone .__.
so whats wrong wi- **HOLY SILVER PLAYERS**, Kevin Durant. omg, k well, im about to lose cya :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, The Knicks and Kings have a much better chance of getting Rondo, if we trade anyone, we're done. Let's see how Hibbert and West lead the team this year. Maybe Stuckey can put up big numbers, his stats when he got starter minutes were just slightly worse than D-Wade this season. Let's hope Solomon Hill is a decent player. Lastly, let's hope Solomon Hill doesn't become the most improved player and Larry Bird does something stupid like trade PG, like they did with Granger, and let's hope they don't trade Hibbert for Monroe, cuz Monroe is only gonna demand a huge contract or leave in free agency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I don't know if people are still looking at this. But....without further ado..

My name is Tim, I posted gaming videos, sometimes Chatroulette trolling, and occasionally a tutorial. 

I do have a capture card for PS3 gaming, but I need to buy HDMI Cables and PS3 HD/AV Component cables

I'm only 15, and I've had a YouTube account since I was 9 lol, but this channel isn't the one from 2007, I made this to start a new chapter in life.

I struggle with depression and anxiety like many teens but I'm also very socially awkward so YouTube is my way to escape from reality, somewhat.

I don't really like posting just gameplay, I like to discuss thing, I'm just not a vLog person so, I commentate over gameplay.

I hope you enjoy my content and subscribe.
Remember it's not an obligation, only subscribe if you like it.

<TEXT> Have you ever thought of embracing the fact that you made a mistake. For instance, I once did something on instagram that made me look gay in front of most of my friends, but I eventually embraced it, if I accidentally did something "homo" I'd just say "oh well I guess I'm gay" and people would laugh. Soon everyone forgot.  </TEXT>
