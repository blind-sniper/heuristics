<TEXT> I'll format it on that when I get home and update :)

I was hoping to oc the cpu I've heard people can get around 4.5ghz from the 2500k? So that's why I thought maybe a better cooler?

What speed RAM should I be looking at? 1333/1600 etc

I'd probably prefer front-side usb 3 as well just for convenience.

Cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys trying to decide on a build I have a 24" 1080p monitor to use but considering on purchasing a 27" IPS screen later with a bigger resolution, I plan to play most games from new fps to things like wow, diablo 3 etc.

These are aussie prices I have from a local vendor near me so they will be a bit more than in US of A also limits my choices a bit! This is it,

Gigabyte ATI HD7850 2GB PCIe $277.20 

Intel Core i5 2500K Un-locked $229.90 

Seagate 2TB SATA3 7200rpm 3.5" $137.50

OCZ Vertex 3 2.5" 120GB SSD $201.30

Seasonic S12D 750W 80+ Silver $181.50

Coolermaster V6 GT CPU Cooler $72.60

Antec Nine Hundred Two V3 Case $134.20

Asus P8Z68-V-LE S1155 $161.70

Total: $1395.90 

I also need RAM but I'm not sure on that one yet because from this place I can only really get Kingston RAM and I don't see that mentioned much so may purchase that online. What would you recommend?

Also not really sure about motherboard either I want something I can run another card on later and with usb 3 support. The vendor has all asus boards but anything else u think is better throw it at me.

If I can get enough money I will swap for a 680GTX which would be ideal to SLI later but otherwise I will get another 7850 bit later and SLI with that, which is why I've gone with a slightly bigger PSU.

Well all advice will be appreciated so throw it at me!

Cheers reddit.

<TEXT> Im just saying its not okay for guys to force themselves onto girls and if thats what happened it should be reported and he should be punished for doing it not oh she was drunk so it was okay.. its not okay ever.. And if thats what happened it would put the OPs mind to rest about his trust for her knowing what happened. OP I hope you can sort it out but its a horrible position to be in :(  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So its okay for her to be pressured into sleeping with the guy? I'm not saying that's what happened, I'm just trying to work out if she was taken advantage of, or if she cheated at her own will.. He doesn't have to beat the guy he can just threaten to report it to the cops and see what the girls thinks about that maybe she was forced and was too scared to say anything the whole thing seems odd to me. </TEXT>
