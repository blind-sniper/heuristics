<TEXT> I get how my comment could be seen as referring to her ass, but I didn't intend to draw attention to that.I honestly just thought it was interesting that the editors chose to include that shot in the trailer. Black Widow has something of a rotating arsenal, and hasn't been given a staple, sort of character defining weapon, the same way other MCU characters have. I saw the inclusion a shot of these guns as interesting considering this contrast. I think she is definitely sexualized within the MCU, but that really isn't what I was trying to point out. If anything, its indicative of a larger issue of our perception of the character, and perhaps more broadly women in popular films like those in the MCU, that you, and maybe other redditors, would assume I was attempting to make an objectifying observation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you are being unfair and unreasonably presumptuous. I do attend class, so I know the Prof didnt mention this during lecture, and I didnt expect to hand in this essay late, I just happen to work 30 hours a week on top of taking a full course load. My question really doesnt have a great deal to do with the prof, so much as it does the hours and staffing at Jackman Humanties. I simply want to know if my paper will be stamped as one day late, if the due date is friday, and it is submitted on a saturday. I am worried that it wont be stamped until monday, at which point it will be seen as 3 days late, despite being submitted just one day after the original due date. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, hopefully they're able to adapt the story-line without sacrificing too much of the original ideas. I think Black Panther is a solid choice, as him being foreign and new to the world of the Avengers will position him as unbiased and neutral, and through his eyes the audience will be able to impartially view either side of the civil war. His recent introduction into modern society is a great stand in for Spidey's pure intentions, and  corresponds well with the growing moral ambiguity in the MCU, especially considering the collapse of Shield, and Tony's role in the creation of Ultron.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> just because he's sitting in a normal chair doesn't mean his legs are functioning. I imagine wheel chairs get uncomfortable after a while, and maybe the chair hes sitting in is stationary, so he couldn't set his wheelchair up anyway.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> my aunt is a heroin addict. the second time she went to rehab, she met her eventual husband, another addict who fathered her child. shes obese beyond belief, and is ruining the lives of my grandparents. she has never had a job, and has lived off the kindness of others for decades. anyways, whenever we would have family dinners, she would be invited, just so we could get her 8 year old son into a positive environment for a little while. know its small, but one of the things she did that got under my skin the most happened on my aunts birthday. i was sitting at the kids table, (im too old for it, but i was playing with my little cousin) and my cousin was super excited to eat the cake we had. he spent all of dinner talking about it, just pumped up, because he never got to eat awesome food at home. anyways, desert rolls around, and my aunt gives him some cake. now, as i said, his mom is super obese, so we never give her cake and what not. as hes trying to eat the cake, she keeps nagging him to give her some, and threatening to ground him and shit if he doesn't. eventually he gives it over. it was just so fucked up to see something as innocent as a little kid eating junk food to be poisoned by such a terrible person. of all the things she has done to my family. stealing away her sons childhood is the most unforgivable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you, its good to hear that there are other people out there who understand what this is like. I just don't think I can ever fully explain what I am feeling. Like when I first tried to explain things to my family, no matter how much I said, I could never really describe what I felt. I know I need to use the resources at my disposal, I just don't really know how. How can I be honest with other people, if I have a hard time being honest with myself?
