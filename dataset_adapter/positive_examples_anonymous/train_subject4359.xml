<TEXT> It's very weird isn't it? I feel more comfortable talking about my depression to people I don't know that well rather than my close friends and family. It's almost like they can't believe I'm depressed. My mom always tried to have me quit taking meds but she saw how much it helped me function after I forgot to pick up a prescription for the week and broke down completely.

Since you've just opened up to them, they must be getting used to the fact now. Give them some time, and perhaps they'll come around and see how much this is affecting you and that you need them by your side.

In the mean time you can always talk to us! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I pulled myself up from feeling like that all the time, but there was one friend that really made me feel inferior. She was pretty, kind, all around "people person". She also comes from a well-off family so she would casually buy designer goods that she clearly did not pay for. I felt bad whenever I felt jealous because she was a genuinely nice person, and it's not her fault that her parents are liberal with their money.

Anyways we went from being best friends to just acquaintances and then I stopped talking to her all together because she reminded me of all things that I couldn't have. What I had could be acquired through effort; what she had was just innate. I couldn't work towards that.

I actually admitted to this via email and explained to her how I felt, how sorry I was that I just stopped talking to her even though she was always very nice. She appreciated it and revealed to me that she was jealous of my academic success (what little there was anyway) and her parents would always compare her to me. That exactly didn't make me feel better but at least let me see she wasn't living the perfect life I thought she had.

I'm still envious of people who are beautiful and sociable but I try to remind myself not all of us can be like that. It's difficult to stick to this, but I try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, from what I've experienced and heard from my physician the clinically depressed can't really function well the entire day. You know one of those bad days you get? That goes on to become a week, month, year, etc.

You are still young and I'm glad to hear apart from acute episodes of feeling low you can go about your day most of the time. Keep it up! I wouldn't say you are clinically depressed just yet. But do consult a doctor if the episodes last longer or become more frequent.

Also I should mention that it's very natural to feel that way during that phase of your life. Talk to your friends, or us (we'll always be here!) whenever you're feeling low. You don't have to talk about how you feel, what happened, if you don't want to. Sometimes it's nice to just talk, y'know?

Anyways these are my two cents. Hope this provided some insight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so sorry your parents didn't respond well. I feel most of the times that is the case :( I guess it's hard for especially parents to just accept that their children are having this type of difficulty, because they might think there were at fault for their children's depression (which might be true in some cases).

I hope she eventually comes to see that just acknowledging that you are going through this can provide some solace.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kudos. I've felt similar pressure when I was your age. Am a girl so no one was hazing me for not banging a random dude, but I felt like I needed it for social validation. Silly, I know, but I was young.

I'm so glad my first time wasn't some mistake because when it happened with the right guy I had no regrets and it was wonderful. I'm sure this is the same for guys as well. You want the type of first time that makes you smile when you look back on it, not cringe or facepalm haha.

Good on you for sticking to your principle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eloquently put. I guess it goes both ways; I can't understand why they feel so persecuted (oh the irony) for their belief, why they think they're being attacked. I spent my adolescence in a catholic high school and we accepted pretty much all kinds of sexual orientation. People would openly come out and no one, including the pastor, would try to change it. I wish I could let them see it's not a compromise that would break down their whole belief system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I doubt OP in the thread would see this, but I've dated guys who were shorter than me and in those cases there were always a turning point for me. At first I was just good friends with them and then I suddenly started seeing them as bf material. One was a romantic poet sort of guy, and the other protected me from a stalker. That kind of turning points.

I hope girls eventually give this a guy a chance. You never know how things will turn out. </TEXT>

I guess in his case it just showed how terrific he was at acting the part of Joffrey but I can see that tearing him down until he became sick and tired of being recognized everywhere. It's funny how some people want to act for glamour and others just want to act and be left alone otherwise.  </TEXT>

But as in cases with most fictional characters, I may find him to be incredibly annoying in real life. Also quite scary given his lobster-like apperance :p </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit: was thinking of Osgiliath but I'll just leave my comment as it was...

 I can definitely relate to the Minas Tirith scene. I love the Khazad Dum and Helms Deep scenes as well, but the battle at Minas Tirith had extra desperation to the atmosphere because Frodo was there. (I hope I'm remembering this correctly; been a while since I read the books / watched the movies.) Much more at stake, and we had Faramir who didn't entirely trust Frodo and Sam. So yeah, I can definitely see why it made you think of Minas Tirith. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This photo makes me d'aww and sad at the same time. I wish I could be at ease around my dad like these cubs. 

He spent most of his time working when I was little and I had little time to get to know him. He was always the Patriarch, Mr. Big-shot at his office, that I respected and feared at the same time. Now that he's retired he gets really hissy when he wants to assert his dominance. His chauvinism annoys me but also makes me sad to see him desperately cling onto his faded glory.

Curious a photograph of a lion and his cubs should bring complicated emotions... </TEXT>

<TEXT> - EMPIRE or STORMCLOAKS?: http://vote.pollcode.com/58192785

I think it's one of few quests that kind of made me sick because of moral dilemma. I myself chose the Empire because I was introduced to TES via Oblivion and well.. it's hard not to like Patrick Stewart's empire. Still I was sympathetic to Ulfric's causes. Visiting Windhelm became painful for me after his death.

- Did you choose to kill Paarthurnax?: http://vote.pollcode.com/32576536

This one was easy for me. I didn't kill him. It seemed plain wrong to kill the dragon after he helped me murder his own brother for the good of the world :s

I'd love to hear what you chose to do, and why. </TEXT>

They first thought he was just a timid but nice guy who needed encouragement. Hence all the advice and gilding. And then they found his other comments. People now feel like they've been fooled and think the guy was faking innocence.

I usually get lunge, dagger throwing, shadow stun (it's been a while and skill names fail me), and lastly whichever skill that suits the dungeon. I've found her accuracy and dodge modifiers to be very useful, more so because she deals a significant amount of damage + crits at the same time (as opposed to the Crusader's and the Leper's skills which take up one full turn without attacking the enemies).

But her elixir and poison dart skills are far from my favourites. Wish the devs would rework those skills :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a bit late to the post so you might have already beaten her by following other advice, but here's my two cents:

- Try to avoid trinkets that decrease the death resistance

- At least one guaranteed healer or champion with heals. Even if the skill only heals by 1 point, as long as they can get someone away from the death's door. I refrained from taking an occultist with me because of the bleeding possibility and the position swaps.

- I'd recommend taking the Vestal and the Crusader for sure. 

- Equip characters with bleeding skills and trinkets. (Highwayman and if you can level up other heroes, Hellion.)  IIRC the Hag is blight-resistant but not so much towards bleeding and those ticks can be valuable when accumulated. 

- Highwayman's point-blank shot + Grave Robber's lunge can rescue those who are tossed into the pot with minimal injury. 

- The Crusader's rush-in skill (I forget the name, the one where he dives to the front) is great for attacking the Hag in the back when partnered up with the Highwayman's point-blank shot.

The Hag bosses were the most challenging for me as well, so I wish you good luck! It's so disheartening to lose beloved heroes to a witch that cooks people in a pot :( </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about leveled items and enchantment damages </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-27 09:22:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understood the term "leveled" as "deciding the quality of the item based on the character's level AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION". So I thought a unique sword obtained in level X would only have the damage of whatever damage that is set for level X for the rest of the game regardless of my future level ups. (Which I thought was true for Oblivion, and hence advice to postpone certain quests to get the best item.) But it seems the items level up with me. e.g. I got Molag Bal's Mace relatively early but the damage is steadily increasing with my level ups. So does the term "leveled item" actually mean their quality increases as I gain more experience?

As for damage enchantments: as I understand it elemental damages are added to the mechanical output --so if a sword can deal damage x and fire damage from enchantment is a, the total damage per swing is x+a-- whereas magicka and stamina damages attack only those qualities and not the enemies' health. Am I getting this correctly?

I went to TES wiki websites but I couldn't get straight answers. Insights appreciated!

edit: typos </TEXT>

<TEXT> Noice! Do you have the soothing whispery voice as well? haha

I really like Skyrim's Argonian voice. IIRC Khajiits and Argonians shared the same voice actor in Oblivion and it became boring wayy too fast.

Also I have wares of suspicious origins that I need to get rid of, if you're interested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, definitely happened to me as well! Sometimes I postpone leveling up when I know I'm gonna fight harder mobs later in the dungeon just in case my health regen / restore potions don't do the job. But damn, 0! I don't think I've pushed to that extreme. Well done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for going through all this trouble. I was really curious about the quality of paid mods, if anything was really worth the money. Thus far I can tell there is none. (Edit: ok Akatosh one might be one exception.) 

Things like Enhanced Towns and Sounds of Skyrim, which I would gladly support the modder(s) with donations, are completely free whereas items that you documented charge people. What complete BS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've also confirmed this, but I think I'll wait a bit before celebrating lest it be premature...  Valve could not have foreseen the potential outrage when they decided to introduce it. It's doubtful they'd just get rid of it THIS quickly. I hope I'm wrong... I'm just gonna hold on to my boycotting just a little bit longer until they issue an announcement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get where he's coming from and I can see why some people don't really like Oblivion as much. But if I remember correctly, certain parts of the game heavily implied that peace and calm (what is referred to as "normal" in the game) were only superficial. Maybe some gamers wanted to see this more played out and presented as a real issue that the hero of the game had to deal with... </TEXT>

<TEXT> At first I thought the crusader's Bulwark skill was completely useless but then I realized it's pretty useful when dealing with the more powerful enemies and bosses.

The same could be said for weakening/debuffing curses. I think the occultist/vestal and the bounty hunter go well together since the latter doesn't have to spend a turn to mark/stun enemies. The curses/stun skills may end up crit'ing and provide some stress relief and the bounty hunter moves in for the kill. </TEXT>

<TITLE> An idea for improving the trinket system </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-26 07:40:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a bit new to the DD subreddit so this might have been discussed earlier but here's my suggestion:

1) Option to sell trinkets

I think this one is a no brainer. I see a lot of people asking for this option on Steam. I don't even want a great payout either. I wish I could get at least SOME money back for trinkets that I never use. 

2) Combiner / Gamble

Something I mentioned in my comment in the Steam community.

Similar to the Horadric Cube in Diablo II or the rune combiner in the League. The player is allowed access to a combiner after completing a veteran level quest (or champion, if the developers see fit). Chuck 2-3 trinkets into it and generate either (a) a trinket that combines some of the properties of the input or (b) a totally random trinket. This way completing previous quests again would have a new perk: get old trinkets that you can gamble with.

I think I can deal with occasionally shitty RNG. I just wish there were more ways to salvage trinkets. </TEXT>

I usually have him do early Harvest or Slice Off to inflict bleed damage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember this from a sociology prof back in my undergrad years about how these sexist lines in sitcoms (an example at that time was Everybody Loves Raymond) often go rather unnoticed because the female character's retaliation soon follows. Everyone laughs but the stereotype is still there (e.g. women belong in the kitchen / should be docile, etc.) and perpetuated. 

We weren't talking about this seriously and I didn't exactly see that type of gag as a problem, but I thought it was interesting regardless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a siamese x turkish angora mix cat. He used to be a sweet kitty with a lot of patience but as he grew older he's become increasingly manipulative. He knows the scheduled meal times but would extort mom into giving treats early by clawing sofa. I don't give in since I don't give a crap about the sofa but mom does so he keeps doing this :s

Another peculiar thing is that he doesn't ever purr except when he gets sleepy and sucks on his arm in the kneading motion. He does this only around me so I should feel blessed, I suppose! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember there was another SRD with people asking OP for the original source when he changed captions of an ad and he got really defensive. He ended the conversation by saying something along the line of "whatever, I'm going to bed and have sex. Bye, losers". So this is what it boils down to in the end? Apparently no one else on the internet is having sex besides these guys?

I get they want to just end the argument. Sometimes people just can't come to an understanding or compromise at all. But to go out with that "doesn't matter, I'm having sex" remark... He may be in his late twenties but his mindset doesn't seem mature enough to consider marriage. </TEXT>

He actually does have mental problems: severe suicidal depression and bi-polar disorder. I'm the one who called the ambulance miles away from him when he went missing and was about to commit suicide. That's how we started dating.

I'm clinically depressed myself, but I don't think this is the ideal path to starting a relationship. </TEXT>

You said you don't care, and yet you continue to reply to my comment in length. What is it that you want to accomplish? I've already explained where my understanding of the two terms came from. I grew up in Vancouver, Canada with both straight and gay friends, and learned that the term homo usually bore negative connotations. It is only natural for me to assume that the word also bears the same sentiment on the web.

Frankly I'm tired of trying to argue with a stranger on the web. You are twisting my words and taking in only what you want. I will no longer respond. Enjoy holidays. </TEXT>

My qualms here was the use of the term homo (NOT homosexual) and the fact that it is widely recognized to be pejorative. The expression "no homo" is often used among people who disapprove of homosexuality. If OP said something like "I'm not gay but" people here wouldn't post negative comments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see. Thanks for explaining it to me in detail. I already got the feeling that what I mentioned wouldn't be a big issue as there were no precedents.

My undergrad major was English literature but right now I'm enrolled in a law-related grad school program and studying intellectual property law. Students vary from lawyers to people like me, who have no prior knowledge of the discipline. Classes are scheduled in the evening (the program is designed for people working full-time) and each subject has only one class every other week so it's been difficult to take in all the material -- not to mention no subject thus far tackled my question here.

But thank you, your response cleared things up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happy Gilmore.

I know Adam Sandler's movies have gotten unbearable lately and when you think about it even the good ones in the past are the product of the same formula, but Happy Gilmore makes me laugh. Probably because when I watched it for the first time as a kid I was having the best night ever with my aunts. And my parents (avid golfers) always say they're so tempted to act like Happy Gilmore in the field. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for a detailed response! I'm playing from Korea so the distance is the main issue. I didn't have a lot of ping problem in S3 - early S4 (stable 150-180 range.) And since I'm using a cable and have no siblings or family members that download lots of porn (or anything big) I think I can rule that out.

I'll look into the VPNs you mentioned! :)

Edit: I tried out Pingzapper and they didn't allow me to run the League with a trial version so I purchased the cheapest package to see if it works. I gave it a go at work and it seems to cause firewall-related problems. It did have an option to bypass security, but it didn't work. I will try the program again later at home. </TEXT>

I later confronted him and at first he lied to me and said he was just saying hi to my mom. I called him out on being a liar and being so immature about the whole mess (we were 17/18 respectively). He ground his fist against the wall like he wanted to punch me. I really wanted him to, so I could punch back, but he never did.

I went on a blind date with a guy who was really full of himself. He was also a hard worker so I could kind of see why he was so proud of his achievements, and I tried to be understanding.

<TEXT> What defines "nice"? This is probably an extreme example but I'm sure Hitler was a pretty nice person to people who blindly followed him. 

IIRC Louis mentioned that implying that they weren't nut jobs when they were going on about their daily routine. They did have a "normal" side to them, loving their family and enjoying little things in life, but it pales next to what they believe and how they act on such beliefs. 

My heart goes out to former WBC members, but I find it hard to believe those who stay there and choose to spread hate can be deemed "nice". </TEXT>

If they had been meaning to buy those particular products, sure, but buying stuff just because it's on sale is pretty silly.

If you can't talk to your friends, feel free to talk to us in detail. Or if you're in school, your school counselor perhaps? Online help goes only so far and it'd be nice to have someone listen to you in person.

<TEXT> Gamer (with Gerard Butler).

I really loved the premise but the ending was total bullshit. I feel like the showdown in the end was so hackneyed and implausible. Why would a CEO risk fighting someone who's proven his physical strength in countless battles? Also what's the point of manipulating someone's mind if the person could just overcome it with the force of will? Also the part about the brothers (I forget the exact name; underground rebels against Michael C. Hall) was pretty lame.

You can't bring down the entire system by just killing off the head guy. You have to slowly affect the system and convince users to drop it. Not sure if a 2-hour movie can show all that, but that would have been the better ending. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The importance of LGBT rights.

I'm currently working abroad in Asia. I was born in this country but emigrated when I was a teen and earned Canadian citizenship. 

It's mind-boggling how LGBT rights are pretty much nonexistent here and people have no idea how offensive they can be when they talk about the LGBT community in a certain way. I've actually had pretty heated arguments with my family members living here over this subject and got into a fight almost. I myself am straight, but I have gay friends back home and my blood boils up whenever people preach all sorts of nonsense. e.g. all gay men will act on their attraction to anyone and will try to rape straight guys. SERIOUSLY?!

<TEXT> Intensity of positive emotions.

When I was looking forward to something I couldn't sleep the night before because I was so excited. When I was happy, I could really feel my heart pumping fast. It is no longer the case. Everything is "meh" to me. I still feel negative emotions to the fullest extent though.

I'm not sure if I can do anything about this. I'm always told to be grateful for what I have but it's very difficult to keep that in mind. </TEXT>

From what I read I don't know if you guys had any issues or what kind of person she is. So it's a bit difficult to come up with any perspective on that note :(

But know that we're here for you and ready to listen. Break ups suck even if you're the one who initiates them. There's really no way to make the pain subside fast.

I would encourage you to eat something if you can. Perhaps some fruit or cereal?

In any case you should really talk to your physician about this if it's a major issue. I don't think many of us here are qualified to talk about the specifics of the meds. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Graduated in 2011, so the memory is more or less fresh.

First off, don't think it's the end of the world and wait for the professor to respond. With any luck, and I find this to be true with most profs, he/she will give you another deadline but with some penalty. That's far better than receiving a zero right? Most profs don't enjoy giving out Fs and they will try to accommodate as long as the student shows the initiative. And I recommend that you disclose your situation (how depression is affecting your life). Some may think this is just laziness/carelessness. It wasn't the case. So unless you're very uncomfortable, telling him/her about your condition would definitely help. If the prof says no and you can't do anything about the essay, you can also ask if there are extra assignments you can hand in.

If all fails? Still, it's not the end of the world. You fucked up, but you can still recuperate. Maybe do better in the exam, or other courses? This may sound too callous, but it really is not the end. Don't worry yourself to death.

As for coping with depression itself: I'm one of the luckier ones that found meds that worked for me. I've talked to counselors a few times but I've found them to be very inefficient. They always told me what I already know. Meds kept me balanced and gave me at least minimum motivation to work on assignments and stuff.

I'm sorry to hear about your friend. I don't know the detail so I'm not sure how to comment on that. :( Talking smack about you to your boyfriend seems like a really shitty thing to do...

But for now your essay situation seems to be the more dire problem, so I hope you get that in order before tackling the friend issue. 

Anyhoo, I hope my comment can give you at least a little bit of courage. Again, it's an obstacle you can handle! PM me if you want to vent. :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Realized my friend was ridiculed on Reddit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-28 03:11:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I can't find the link right now and the reverse image search on both Google and Karma Decay shows that it's gone, but there was a photo of a woman wearing an engagement ring in the comment section of another photo. The ring seemed a bit tight for her and everyone was blatantly making a crack at that, or saying how it looked cheap. Someone said something along the line of: "who says you can't buy an engagement ring where you can buy tires?"

Today I logged onto facebook and discovered my friend got engaged on her birthday. I was so psyched. I made an international call to her (I'm working overseas), congratulated her, and we were both so happy. I've known her for a long time and she's such a sweetheart.

I got off the phone and scrolled further down her profile only to see the exact same photo that was ridiculed on Reddit.

That's when I did the reverse image search. It seems like there's no trace of it now for some reason.

I'm very sure it's the exact same photo because it popped up recently and the angle / the shape of the ring -- everything really matches up. 

I really didn't want to upset my friend when she was so happy but I told her about it just so she would increase the privacy setting on her FB and go through the friends list to get rid of people who might do this.

Whoever posted that link in the comment was a friend of my friend. I guess that's what's pissing me off, not so much that it happened on Reddit. I have a vague idea who might have done this based on what my friend told me before but I have no proof. And the link is gone now, for the better or worse.

Sigh. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Playing with older cats -- suggestions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-24 02:48:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I moved to Asia for work and my cat (9 y/o) is trapped inside a highrise apartment with very little to observe outside. It's been like this for about three years now and I feel so bad. 

He shows little interest when I try to play with him using the "traditional" cat toys. I know he's really bored and would like to bring in another cat, but that's not in the cards right now.

I also tried bringing him outside in a stroller (all sides closed but he can still look outside) but he was very stressed out and would yeowl until I brought him home. Mind you I did this in a residential area with no traffic or loud noises. There were some kids playing about but I always kept them at a safe distance where he wouldn't be subjected to any unwanted attention.

Could someone suggest ways to entertain him? Even though his appetite and weight haven't changed I'm afraid he's depressed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The variation of the main theme + really unsettling, even barbaric tunes when the Wildlings are butchering the Brothers. Every aspect of the episode was superb but I was especially immersed in the music. It almost reminded me of that used back in the Charlton Heston era. Very epic, traditional, and hits right in the nostalgia. Music definitely gave the mammoths and giants the more threatening atmosphere. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Firefox/IE suddenly has a certificate problem with Gmail/Google. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been using Firefox for nearly five years now and all was well and suddenly it reports a certification issue with gmail/google. When I google something I have to add an exception for EVERY SINGLE KEYWORD I type in. For Gmail it doesn't even give me an option to rule it out as an exception.

At first I thought this was Firefox-specific so I tried it again with IE but it has the same issue. I've been checking my mail via phone :( I guess I can make do with it but I don't understand why it's suddenly acting up this way.

Has anyone else had a similar problem? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to like the Watch Later function. I would add a bunch of videos, sort them to my liking, and add them to a neat little list. It would also show which one I watched so when I went back I could either restart or move onto the next one. 

Now it only has a "remove watched video" function and the ability to leave notes (which makes me wonder just how many people actually use this).

Switching to Google+ is one thing. Now the comment section works fine, it doesn't share everything I write to Google Circle automatically, so I can begrudgingly accept the change.

Why tamper with what already worked fine?

Please, if I'm missing something here and complaining about this because I don't know better, someone let me know. I'd rather admit that I'm an idiot than continue on with this nonsense. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Things I do to cope with depression </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-20 07:47:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I considered posting here when I was feeling particularly low but I always think that there's someone worse off than me and I should buck up. (But I never use this logic on someone else as I hate hearing it from others myself.) Instead I've decided to post some of the things I do when I feel really down in spite of meds. Perhaps it will be of some help to some.

- Watching the Simpsons and Futurama

I find Matt Groening's work incredibly therapeutic. I also watch South Park and Family Guy too but the Simpsons and Futurama have a warm edge that its contemporaries don't really seem to have. Futurama is especially endearing. I watch episodes nonstop and just lose myself in the story and characters. They make jokes that might be considered dumb/outdated by today's standard but that makes it so nostalgic and cozy.

- Reorganizing and cleaning out the desk / closet

Sometimes my mind is off-limits. I can't deal with it. But the physical act of cleaning my room gives me a sensation similar to reorganizing my thoughts. A neater, well-organized room is just a byproduct. I fold my clothes, do laundry, do the vacuum cleaning, etc. I play music I love loudly and focus intensely on cleaning and that only. It's like workout except I'm enjoying it. I wish I loved exercise but I really, really hate it. So much. I could never relate to people's advice on working out for expelling thoughts that get me down. Cleaning is a good substitute I think.



Perhaps hackneyed and worn out ideas, but I thought these may help and that I should just write these down to remind myself again. I'm at work and I can do neither right now. I feel trapped and am forcing myself to smile. I'm on the verge of just giving up but I have to move on. I don't know why I feel this way. I just am. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A glimpse of how I felt without my meds </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-02 07:33:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Context: I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was in high school (i.e. 7+ years ago). I was on cytalopram for a while but it didn't do much for me. Luckily about three years ago I found medications that worked for me. The current pills I'm taking are SNRIs, the primary agent being venlafaxine.

Last Monday I was supposed to go see my psychiatrist but I was making an important call during my lunch break and I forgot. I thought to myself: what harm could it do? I had some leftovers from previous appointments and I would only miss a day's worth. How callous I was.

So this is how I felt: sensory overload in every turn.

Every sound delved into my head like a jackhammer. I put on earphones without listening to anything but it didn't do anything. My coworker's keyboard typing which I would normally ignore was so painful that I had to leave the room for a while. Secretaries walking fast-paced here and there hit me like a gong. It resonated within me. They irritated me and numbed me to the core at the same time. I wanted to attack someone.

I turned to work to maintain focus. I work as a translator at a law firm. I usually work on court decisions, briefs, complaints, etc. I'm always fascinated by the stories I read. It lessens the inevitable boredom destined to come with the line of my profession. I picture them in my head and it helps me visualize. Concentrate.

I was assigned to translate a complaint a few days ago so I was working on it. I tried to calm myself as I tried to regain control over my senses and just work. It was okay for a while until I hit the word SUICIDE. A former rep director of a company being sued had committed suicide.

Normally I would just look upon it with some dismay and move on. It's really unfortunate but what can I do?

In this instance I couldn't just move on. My eyes were fixed on the word. I felt like I was about to throw up. I didn't know the person. And yet the word stabbed me and I was left in shock. I wanted to cry.

That was when I decided I couldn't stay in the office. I had taken the meds at that point but it wasn't working fast enough. I had to go home.

I feel better now. I can withstand my surroundings once more. The words don't send me into shock like before.


I thought I'd share this with you while the memory and the sensations are still fresh. My mom always tells me to "will the depression away". I'm not just having a bad day. I can't function without these pills. Call me a weak-willed person if you want. That doesn't change the fact that I'd just crawl into a corner and do nothing without meds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen action figures and plush toys, but these are pretty common throughout any series. 

What kind of novelty items would you like to see for Futurama specifically? (e.g. an F shirt with a fake mutant arm attached?)

I've seen on Reddit someone knitted a Zoidberg mask for their kid for Halloween and would love to own one myself it was for sale.

Other random things: "Nixon 30xx" bumper stickers, Slurm (sans the secret ingredient), Bender's purple camera, a digital photo frame shaped like the What-If machine, Gemerald ring candy </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm dating someone my parents hate. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-03 03:22:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been seeing him for the last two and a half years now.

I come from a culture where going to university is a norm. If you failed to get post-secondary education, you're deemed as a failure.

I spent the majority of my life in North America and on papers and in my heart I consider myself as a westerner, though I don't look it. I moved to the country I was born in to get a job and I'm living with my parents. I insisted on moving out but they wouldn't let me. They went so far as to say that they would disown me if I did. But I digress...

I'm turning 26 this August and due to the said culture I'm considered a marrying age. But I don't think I'll get married any time soon if ever. If I were back home I might have moved in with this guy but here cohabitation is frowned upon. Big time.

I've been lying to my parents in regards to my relationship with him. I said we broke up and are now just friends. Maybe it's because they suspect something but they still don't like the fact that I stay in touch with him.

It's not like my boyfriend is a socially unacceptable human being. I admit there were some times when I wished he'd studied more, but I've come to accept that I can't rely on romantic relationships to satisfy my intellectual needs. We have fun together and most importantly, when we argue about something and he's at fault, he admits it, apologizes, and tends not to repeat the same mistake. His open mindedness is what won me over in the first place. I come from a drastically different background and he was very accepting.

On the CV he appears to have all things that are considered to be "red flags" in the Asian cultures: had an abusive father, his parents are divorced, he didn't attend university, etc.

I'm having an increasingly difficult time letting my parents see the fact that I'm not looking to get married and I'm just in a stable relationship. And even if I DO end up marrying him, would that be the end of the world? So what if I'm enrolled in a graduate school program and working at the same time, making twice as much as his annual salary? Does that somehow make me a better person? We're compatible and have fun. Our attitudes on important issues are similar. When we have an argument it's a clean fight without emotional scars. Isn't that the most important thing in a relationship?

I feel so cornered. I feel so pressured to break up with him because I don't know how to handle my parents. I don't know whether I want to marry him so I don't even know if I should take a stronger stance on this and force them to accept things as they are. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need some help with shipping out a BB gun internatinoally. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-04 02:54:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

very first post here. I'm in a bit of trouble with my newly purchased BB gun and I was wondering if any of you can help me out.

I just bought a Walther P99Q with metal pellets and I'm moving to South Korea (Seoul) soon. I'm sending most of my bulky stuff via sea, and I thought this would be okay. From my research it seems like it's a definite no-no on flight, be it a check-in or carry-on, but no one has given me an answer about shipping it through, well, a ship. (I know I should've checked this first, but my desire trumped reason... ugh.) 
If it comes to the worst, I guess I'll have to sell it to an acquaintance before I leave. (The store takes no refund. Again, very stupid of me.)

I'm sending it from Vancouver, Canada, to Seoul, ROK. Anyone who knows anything about the customs/security, I'd really appreciate your advice.

*Wow I just mispelled internationally and can't edit the title. Damn. </TEXT>
