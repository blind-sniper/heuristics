<TEXT> I had an experience several years ago when a friend encountered something overseas and brought it back with him, it then proceeded to attach itself to me. 
It would present itself to me as a really strong pungent shit smell right under my nose and no one else could smell it, on three separate occasions - my workplace, outside my friend's house and at my mother's house. 

A psychic who was a friend of a friend told me that it was a trickster and had latched itself onto me because i'm sensitive but don't realise it therefore I can't protect myself. 
I was lucky because this trickster had the potential to do some real damage. She banished it to another plane and cloaked me in protection. 

It was the most bizarre experience I've ever had and I still don't know what to make of it to this day. I sure as hell don't tell many people out of fear they'll think i'm nutso.  </TEXT>

Distractions and realising you just have to keep on going, the world doesn't stop for you so that you can curl up into a corner and cry. Set yourself little goals and then take steps to achieve them. Give yourself a purpose. 

Learning coping mechanisms so that you can roll with the punches also helps.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should probably add my two cents here too. 

Best: Provides a sturdy shelf for balancing my plate on while I'm eating. Some tops/dresses look better with some chesticle shapes. They feel pretty damn good.   

Worst: Lying on my back - they flatten out and leak to the sides, not ideal. In addition to sagging, I'm worried about getting cleavage wrinkles as I age.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect it may be related to the anger she has towards my father who left us when I was 7 years old. They had huge problems even before I was born and they thought having me would help their marriage. They thought wrong. 

As a teen I figured we didn't get along because I was a typical broody teen but as I got older and moved out I realised it went beyond that, she just really didn't like me. At 29, I'm really sad that we don't have a good relationship. I just don't know what to do.

The silver lining is, as I watch her get colder and more miserable I'm working on being warmer, happier and kinder to others.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother told me my eldest brother is her favourite child while I was her least favourite, I was 10 years old.

When I was 13 we were approached by a homeless man who wanted to shake our hands. She got up and quickly walked away while I was left there awkwardly not wanting to touch his hand but not wanting to be rude either. She didn't turn back once to see if I was ok. Later when I caught up to her, she yelled at me for talking to the homeless guy. 

6 years ago I got pretty sick and needed a bone marrow transplant, my eldest brother didn't want to do a blood test to see if he was a match. My mother defended him and explained that he's busy at work and can't take time off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey - don't stop doing what you're doing. 
I personally don't think we have a valid excuse to be rude to guys who approach us simply because we're "not in the mood" or we're already taken. If you genuinely just want to say hi and start a friendly conversation, there shouldn't be anything wrong with that!

If you're being sleazy/creepy and all up in our personal space too soon and getting touchy/feely - our body language will tell you we're uncomfortable then yeah, chances are you're going to end up getting rejected. Outside of these kind of scenarios - a rude bullshit snappy "not interested" is pretty stink. Turn right around and walk away - you just dodged a bullet.

<TEXT> Exactly! And then if the answer is no you can move on. What have you got to lose? Good luck and let us know how it went!!

In my opinion, when my texts start getting a bit sparse and short i'm actually just politely answering your texts but I'm also losing or feigning interest - I need to stop doing that and just be up front.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) There are girls who want the attention but get snappy when they're not drawing attention from specific people they are seeking attention from. 

2) There are girls who make the effort to look nice for themselves - a little boost to their self-esteem and not necessarily attention from others although that also helps to boost their confidence. 

3) There are girls who try to one up each other - female competition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. 
I find it really hard to get up in the morning, I find myself getting anxious the night before counting the hours of sleep I'll get. I can sleep 12 hours solid and still want more sleep. Ironically, I stay up late because I don't want to sleep. 
Hope things work out for you too! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Update - back to work today. Put on my mask this morning and went about my day acting "normal" with the odd occasion of staring out the window thinking. Thinking. That's always been my problem - trying to find ways to switch it off but my mind is always racing and whizzing from one topic to another and then back again. 

Today's motto has been "fake it til you make it" and hopefully this wave will pass soon if I keep myself distracted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. 

I went through a period of having to take some pretty serious heavy duty meds for a serious illness (prednisone and cyclosporin) the side effects really messed me up which adds to my fear but you're right - there are a lot of different drugs out there so if something doesn't work, there's always other alternative combos. 

Hope your journey continues to be a safe and happy one! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents transferred me to a new high school when I was 14 and I absolutely hated it. I decided not to go for about a week and a half and just stayed in my room and locked the door. My parents were at work but my bro was still home and he would bang on the door and i'd hide in the closet just in case he came in. 

I had to think of elaborate ways to appear like I had gone to school so one day I decided to throw my backpack out of the window and I climbed out of my second storey bedroom window and was holding onto the window sill trying to decide whether I'd jump onto the bush below or just try to slide my way down somehow. 
Ended up realising how stupid I was being and climbed back in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on a school camping trip and we had gone snorkeling one afternoon, our guide for the day can't have been more than 5 years older and was smoking hot. I wasn't a huge fan of breathing out of my snorkel so I was slightly panicking. When I saw from my underwater view that everyone was perched on a rock resting I was stoked. I was even more stoked to see that among all the perchers was the smoking hot guide in a wet suit that hugged all the right places. I "accidentally on purpose" grabbed his junk as he helped me climb up onto the rock. I was 12. </TEXT>

Her automatic payment had already processed, she went ahead and made another payment through online banking because she didn't read her invoice that stated she didn't have to do anything further - we're happy to refund the second payment back but I don't see how that's our "system's fault" that she didn't read the information on her invoice.

She suggested the "system" should be clearer to remind her about the automatic payment. The bill clearly states she has an automatic payment in place and that she does not need to worry about making a payment....no wonder she's grappling with those reports... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Up until the beginning of this year I had been friends with this person for 11 years since our uni days. In hindsight, it was a toxic friendship - I had to constantly walk on eggshells for fear of pissing him off, he constantly had tantrums, was very calculative and he only helped others if it benefited him. Everyone was scared to stand up to him because we didn't want to rock the boat. 

After coming home from a road trip with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday I spoke to a mutual friend about how hurt I was that this friend constantly sulked, got angry and even gave me the silent treatment for a couple of hours. This "friend" had told me on my birthday that when friends piss him off, he likes to make them feel like shit. That was the last straw for me, that's not what friendship is about. 
This mutual friend told this guy what I had said and obviously this "friend" of mine was royally pissed and started ignoring me while trying to gather a merry band of idiots to turn against me as well. He managed to turn another friend I had known for 11 years against me but was unsuccessful with the others. (We're all in our late to early 30s)

We never patched things up, I was very upset about it all for months but then I started realising that I was finally free of this toxic influence in my life and I could now enjoy the friendships I choose to nurture. It's not about how long you've known the person, it's about the kind of influence they have that matters for example, whether they're positive and supportive people. It's still very awkward when our original group gets together but it's OK, I'm spending most of my time now with wonderful amazing friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the simple things in life for me, I'm trying to appreciate what I have and concentrate my energy on the things I enjoy the most in order to find my own inner happiness and contentment. My biggest problem I'm trying to work on is to continue to work towards issues within my circle of influence rather than factors that I have no control over (circle of concern). </TEXT>
