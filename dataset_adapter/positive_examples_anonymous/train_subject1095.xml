<TEXT> Basically it is saying that it won't be a typical hero movie.

It is not exactly a big deal, but a huge sigh of relief to get confirmation that the movie is on the right track.

Either way I highly suggest picking up a volume or two of Sandman. Few rarely regret it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shadowman and Bloodshot are both part of Valiant. The comics got rebooted from the 90s a couple years ago. Since they are all pretty fresh it is easier to play catch up on. From the looks of it you would probably like The Death-Defying Dr. Mirage and Quantum and Woody, but really most Valiant titles are pretty spot on. Today Valiant actually released the trade for their 4 part series called The Valiant, in which Bloodshot plays a main role.

Now for other classics check out the other comments is this thread, but a personal favorite of mine is Vertigo's Sandman.

Comic can get expensive and a good place to find trades on the cheap is instocktrades.com.

Also check out your local Library! </TEXT>

Not to mention the Mark was said to be both a lock and a key, so I figure it is gone until being recast.

<TEXT> Didn't realize the decay was partly due to his immense power. 

Season 11: God reveals himself by saving Sam and Dean from getting swallowed by the Darkness wave, since they are the true vessels for Lucifer and Michael (God needs them to defeat the Darkness again of course) who both get let out (Due to the huge potential power of the Book of the Damned) and end up using Sam and Dean as their all too willing hosts. All of them go through the whole season in typical hunter, monster of the week, fashion fighting the Darkness. </TEXT>

How do you even get an explicit label on an INSTRUMENTAL album? That is a feat in and of itself...I mean whoever decided to give it an explicit label was surely thinking, "This music is so 'out there' that no 'normal' person would think to make it sound the way it does."

<TEXT> Digital format does indeed use a "key" file. Usually it is just for features, but occasionally trailers need a key too (mostly high profile trailers such as Hunger Games). 

If I understand right, the MPAA can figure out exactly which theatre a recording is from by applying some kind of filter to a certain frame of a feature. 

I would imagine the BvS trailer would have a key, at least for the Premier version, and chances are that if the DC cares enough the theatre this one is recorded in can be in trouble. </TEXT>

**Darth Vader #4** Decent enough so far

<TEXT> I am trying to decide between Wonder Woman, Supergirl, and Batwoman. Might go ahead and do all three, but the other titles such as American Vampire and even Fables and Ghost are hard to choose from. I might just have to go by a pages/cost ratio to decide.

Either way, I **highly**  recommend the Death: Deluxe Edition. I have the physical copy and it is still a such an amazing deal on such a good story collection (even if you are completely new to Neil Gaiman's Sandman and the Endless Mythos) that I am considering buying it in digital form, which at just 1&#162; a page is a massive steal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valiant relaunched a couple years back (they were around in the 90s) and practically all their titles are excellent. If you want comedy, Archer and Armstrong or Quantum and Woody are great series. If you like mythical/magical, Shadowman is decent. Eternal Warrior is about one of the most prominent characters in Valiant and is contained in two trades. Can never go wrong with X-O Manowar with it being pretty much Valiant's flagship title. 

On current series not yet in trades: Ivar, Time Walker is fun and you don't need to know too much about the Valiant Universe, but it definitly will help make connections. 

Keep an eye on Humble Bundles, I managed to get a good chunk of Valiant trades for not very much. Or perhaps check out Scribd since Valiant has a good amount of digital issues in this service.

<TEXT> Free Digital copies with the purchase of physical copies.  

Make more Netflix Series.

Live Action JLD.

Give Klarion a better run.

1 event maybe 2 a year.

Crossovers not nearly as much or as long.

Not make trades come out several ARCS after the fact. Kinda like how Image does what? Like a month after the last issue in a trade.

DC Unlimited.

Make Humble Bundles for at least older comics.

Make sure Elektra actually lasts for a decent run.

Make flagship issues longer with "shorts" in the middle. Like a Batcow short story in Batman.

More easter eggs and no more white borders. We need more art to look at while reading.

And an all New Crossover between the universes.

<TEXT> [Album](http://imgur.com/a/fynBk)

My local shops all seemed to run out of Divinty #1 so had that ordered. Same with The Valiant #2. I really need to remember to add items to my pull list.

Didn't realize the Ant-Man movie Prelude part 1 was already out so got me a copy.

Ordered the Auxiliary Cover for Lady Death Apocalypse #1. Always wanted to check out the series, but never felt like playing catch up. This issue really summed it up well.

Ordered Sandman Vol. 6-9, finally completeing my collection (I already had vol. 10 when a shop had a closing sale). Have five trades to binge read now.

Swamp Thing N52 Vol. 5 came in same order (which I placed 1 week before IST had a massive DC sale T.T) It is an excellent story and can't wait for vol. 6.

Last is Sandman #19. Found at a local shop when I was searching for my favorite issue (#18). It is the corrected version, but is still a very fine issue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually go a couple days between reading sessions. I'll always finish a single issue right then if I start it. I'll read a few at a time, but if I notice myself drifting off I will finish the issue I am on and take a nap (reading tends to knock me out, even comics). I have no real preference on singles vs trades. Occassionally I'll read a whole trade in one sitting, just depends on how well it sucks me in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the longer movies 10 more minutes for intermission isn't going to affect the number of showings. A 3 hour movie with 15 minutes of trailrrs and 30 minutes minimum between the ending and starting of a movie in a particular auditorium, gives you 225 minutes between start times. Say they open at 9am and close at 11pm, that gives you 14 hours to schedule as many as possible. You still only get 3 showtimes in one auditorium. 10 more minutes for an intermission per movie won't really change that. Now if it's for a two hour movie the intermission will cut into potential showtimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Deer God and Exile are both decent games with a lot of potential. Aralon and Ravensword are both excellent RPGs that can consume a good amount of time, but have been in previous bundles. Mines of Mars is a pretty fun game and is along the lines of Terreria. Pocket RPG and 8bit Cowboy are also decent. Those are only ones I've tried so far. So 7 entertaining games for $8 is a steal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1, 2, and 3 are part of a trilogy with 3 being a prequel to the first two. Most don't like 1 nowadays, simply because it is very linear and basic. 2 is not as linear and introduced the party system. 3 has an excellent class system and is the strongest of the first three. 4 and 8 are both solid titles as well. 

Honestly I would start with 3 and if you want to learn more of that particular storyline 1 and then 2. I'm personally waiting for DQ7 to be ported. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the Annotated Sandman vol. 3 recently came out, so you could get the penultimate set for just ~70$ 

I suggest Sword of Scorcery Vol. 1: Amethyst, it is New52, but is fully contained in just this trade and was an excellent read. I really enjoyed All Star Western and coming up this next week or two I believe Animal Man's final trade (vol 5) comes out, so you could get the whole run in one go and have one free book to spare.

Batman Earth One was a really good read, along with Black Mirror and Noel.

For Vertigo, I really liked Spaceman by Brian Azzarello and the Deluxe edition has a nice hardcover on it. The Death Deluxe trade is also a nice collection about that particular Endless member. 100 Bullets just got Book One released (kinda like multiple trades in one).

Of course, if you can afford it, I'd go for the various Event Omnibuses that are out there.

All in all, make sure you compare final costs to other discount sites like instocktrades, since occassionally the other sites will still be cheaper. 

I personally been needing to get caught up on GLs and the Flash and this sale is gonna help me out </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep an eye on Google Play Books. They occassionally have very good deals for Digital Editions. The other month I got the Walking Dead Compendiums for a little over $10 combined. At 1000 pages each that is a steal. The Big Publishers usually have good sales around the holidays. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apart from being a horror (several people think it is along the lines of Human centipede), it was poorly marketed. I saw zero trailers/standees/posters for it and I work at a major theatre chain. In fact they added the trailers a week before it came out. On top of that it has poor distribution. Many times I read on here that it is just too far away for people to go see, especially with less than spectacular reviews.

All in all almost no one I work with had heard of the movie release weekend and the ones that did are the ones that, like me, live on the internet.

I would also check out your local Halfprice Books. They usually have a decent selection of Graphic Novels which you can flip through to see if anything strikes your fancy.

One series I've personally enjoyed is Sandman by Vertigo. </TEXT>

Got first two from a humble bundle a while back and enjoy both. I feel it was way too easy to get money in Ravensword (Just grind the goblin hideout and fast travel to it once cleared, at 60g per shield dropped by every goblin it didnt take long to max out on best gear available.

Found Dragon Ball on the play store. It isnt too bad, but still has a good amount of translation from Vietnamese to be had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a Lucifer vertigo series, which I am hIghly enjoying (just finished first trade collection), I believe it picks up after the events in Sandman Volume 4. I recommend reading those first four volumes of Sandman first, but not exactly necessary.

Now if I remember right, I think Lucifer Trades were originally printed in smaller collections, but were more recently put into thicker trades. A quick glance at the wiki page will help sort them out. 

If you enjoy Sandman, I recommend the Death Deluxe trade. It has both Death of the Endless' trades in it in addition to some other stories. One of my personal favorite books I've bought.

As for trigon, havent really read much on him.

EDIT:

Sandman Overture #3 just cameout last week and was quite wonderful IMO. Try to track down the first two issues. It isn't exactly on a regular release schedule, like several months between issues. </TEXT>

The Deluxe Death Trade that collects all her stories in one is a decent related title at a good price. And After volume 4, it would be a good time to start the Lucifer trades if you are interested in how his story continues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started late with my **Justice League 3000** pulls so I just got the first two last week (a local LCS wanted $20 a piece so did Midtown for reg. Price) and read all 8 just the other day. It is an interesting story and how it ties in to Future's End is interesting when they mentioned they have 97% of all metahuman DNA from the island 1000 years ago. Happy to be current on it.

Ordered Outcast #1 from Image with those two, since it sold out everywhere I looked. Decent take on Exorcisms and looking forward to the explanation of his blood burning the possesed.

Read through the other day the Batman Manga Death Mask. It was an interesting story with a little background of Bruce in Japan.

Currently working on the first Hellblazer arc in Original Sins TP and enjoying it so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly the movie with Keanu Reeves was my first encounter with anything Constantine. I know almost quite literally everyone denounces the movie as being a Constantine film, but I love it none the less. My first comic ecounter was the New 52 JLD and Constantine trades, I tried catching up with the single issues, but never really put much onto it so I just wait for trades.

Just started Hellblazer vol. 1, and am still in middle of first arc, I find it intetersting, but am going through it slow since I'm reading a couple different books at the same time.

My vote for next title is Lucifer vol. 1. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For New 52 I like the Batman Eternal weekly. The story is great and I cant wait to see how the Commissioner comes out of this. 

I've been pulling most of The Dark comics ( Justice League Dark, Phantom Stranger, Pandora) but havent quite read them yet since I am missing a couple issues here and there. The trades for them all are great. For Swamp Thing and Animal Man I just wait for their trades and have yet to be disappointed. 

Justice League United seemed to start out strong so I'll keep checking it out.
I do recommend Sword of Sorcery: Ameythst trade if you can find it. Since it was a short run it is all collected together.

Secret Origins is a nice take on the origins on well known heroes. 

Not exactly New 52, but still Vertigo, I do enjoy Sandman: Overture. However it is only two issues in and it is months in-between releases. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been over a year since I quit. Usually smoked 10g's Over 2-3 days, but had days where I would burn through a whole bag. Got pretty bad with it. I only smoked it out of a pipe so I would collect the ash/partially solid matter  and then shift it just enough to get the white ash off. Would basically smoke and resmoke until it just couldnt be lit anymore, strangely each hit was just as strong as a fresh bowl. Most days I would smoke until I pass out for like 15-30 minutes then toke up again repeating the process until lunch/dinner with the coma-naps getting longer as the day went on. I also woulx wake in the middle of the nightbjust for the sole purpose of getting another round in. Shit took its toll fast, mostly psychologically (sometimes voices but mostly just horrible paranoia/anxiety) but did notice chest pains and was constantly coughing shit up (tooks months of being off it to finally clear it up) I did pawn shit that was and wasn't mine to pawn just to get the next sack. Credit Cards were already pretty much maxed by the time I started using, but coincidentally my minimum payment was about as much as a sack was, so the cards stayed maxed out. 

My advice is to try to come to terms with the debt pile and slowly work it off. If you havent already, destroy the cards. You can always get new ones, but the wait for the replacements should help curb any craving or momentary loss of self-control. If you aren't completely ostrochised from your family, maybe have someone take control of your funds for a bit, the first couple months are always the hardest to resist the urge to re-up.

Invest in an e-cigarette. Doesn't even have to have nicotine in it. The act of blowing out smoke can help alleviate the urge to start smoking it again.

If your drug counselling is a group setting, try to be open to the others' stories and experiences. You might find some inspiration in their life experiences. 

They'll probably suggest this at counseling, but maybe look into a Narcotics Anonymous group. I never did do that, but it can definitly help with the healing process.

As for depression, that is a whole 'nother beast that I've struggled with my whole life. Hopefully yours is just due to temporary chemical imbalances and not hereditary. Either way /r/depression is a wounderful community at your disposal. 

Everything I said/suggested is purely from my own experience. Make sure you communicate with your doctors everything as they will know the best way to help you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   This whole debacle has potentially made that much more difficult here.

I think, if NZ is really going to have a rigorous screening process for the legal highs, then this will help with the education/protection for addicts regarding it all. I mean pretty much anyone can grow weed, but how many times have you heard of someone cooking up their own version of spice in their backyard? So as long as the new screening process isnt just a red herring that they hope people will forget about, then it will be more conducive to a healthier legal high culture.

<TEXT> I don't know about other places, but when he had it in Texas it went for about $30/10g or $20/3g, depending on brand which is way cheaper than $20/g kush or $50/14g korn. Of course the perceived tolerance IME shoots up pretty high pretty fast with the synths so what you're saving just goes towards more of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FTA: "The New Zealand government's **testing regime**, expected to be **as rigorous as** that applied to **pharmaceutical drugs**, means that it could cost manufacturers of legal highs over $1 million NZD (&#163;500,000) to have each product approved.

I'm sorry but I don't see the problem here. Is this not what we wanted? A stable product that isn't going to change its chemical make-up everytime a new law takes place? I don't pretend to know NZ politics, but I know as a former US spice user that I do wish I knew exactly what I was using and wish America did something along these lines instead of wave after wave of bans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man fuck this last year. Fuck it royally. Fuck the fact that I got promoted. Fuck the fact I kicked the several year long spice habit. Fuck the fact I got laid for the first and only time. Fuck it all. I still fucked up at school for the 3 or 4th time and am probably suspended from the system. . . again...I still drove her away with the creepiness and general beta-mindset. . ..still broke all the time cause I have poor money management skills...behind a couple months on my cards and will have student loans starting up again now that I'm out of school..
Fuck the fact old friends are back in town graduated and not responding to texts or calls. ..man fuckall this. At least I have my music.

Only people to remember it's my birthday is my ma, cousin, sister. Oh yea and the student loan company emailing me happy birthday trying to collect. But it's cool I get free movie tickets whenever I want. Oh and I get free stuff today at the smoke shop...

<TITLE> Looking for a certain type of headwear </TITLE>

<TEXT> As seen on Snoop Lion [here](http://i.imgur.com/v2OxaH7.jpg) 

I have always been a fan of that style headwear, but just never could find them.

First, what are they called?

Second, I'm not really looking for that color scheme per se, just one that'll work well on St. Patrick's Day.

Much Obliged.
