<TEXT> Very sad situation. It sounds like you're a great guy, and I feel for you dude. I don't understand her end game though. You said she has an agenda. What is it? Why is she keeping her kids from a good father? And then being plain mean to him? Just...wtf!?!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been pretty neutral on gun control in the US. This story did it for me. A house party turning into a battle zone can't happen in most countries because of sensible gun laws.

<TEXT> Thanks guys! 

This is a subject I don't know a lot about, so all input is appreciated. When I hear HSBC say things like "the world economy is like an ocean liner without a lifeboat" it makes me wonder what's going to happen to my RMB. That, and I'm sure China's plateauing growth can't be good either, but I don't know how that works either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A mentally impaired man lived with his adorable parents in the house across the street.

I never saw him out of the house unless he was being led into the family's Lincoln Towncar. He shuffled. He mostly stared at the ground. He really was just a sad kid in a middle aged man's pot bellied, unshaven body, but at 6 that made zero sense to me. 

So when he was hunched over the fence, ogling me as I biked up and down our culdesac one summer afternoon, I was confused. When he asked if I had rope and tape, I was scared. When he opened the gate and chased me back to my driveway, I was terrified. 

I still have a vivid memory of me jumping off the rear bumper of my dad's car to reach the rope hanging from the bottom of the garage door, and turning the lock.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> KCW. Keys, cell phone, wallet, the three essential elements of my peace of mind. I can't leave anywhere without exercising the KCW pat down. If i do lose a KCW, it's just an obnoxious and costly bummer. But if you will, those are my children. 

If you created and raised a child, your animal instincts kick in whether you like it or not. The animal inside you won't fine peace of mind until your child is able to thrive in h/er environment.  If you lose a child, youre going to go through primal sadness. I would assume that would be enough to keep your child near while your on vacation. 

Sorry, this is a real This happens? moment for me. There is even a name for it!?!?!?! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a hard time making friends in high school. Every year I'd find another guy that had a hard time making friends, and we'd keep each other company for a year. Same classes, same lunch hour. It only worked cause  it was easy. 

Senior year was...we'll call him...Kyle. Kyle was like Samuel, Patrick, and Colin before him. Smart, nice enough, aware, but just insecure and a few months behind everybody else. Late bloomers, for whatever reason. He also liked the new girl, Lacy. 

I was also insecure and the latest of the bloomers, but I started getting attention my senior year. The "hottest girl in the school for sure" asked me out for coffee and we dated for a couple months. This meant I was no longer a wallflower. Kyle and I got to hang out with people other than ourselves, a very radical thing in our friendship. However, we dealt with it just fine. Until Lacy asked me out.

I said yes because she had a certain reputation, and because, ehhh, a girl thought I was worthy. Needless to say, I went into for all the wrong reasons and immediately cheated on her, which I immediately told Kyle, who I immediately told Lacy, who immediately dumped me, and I immediately never talked to Kyle. 

Kyle compensates with muscles and angry FB posts to this day. 

Oh yeah, we're still FB friends.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Living amongst them. The three things I noticed within the first twenty minutes after leaving the airport were 1) Traffic laws were a suggestion 2) Spitting and burping is appropriate behavior 3) Smoking is cool anywhere. Hotel lobbies, elevators, THE LOCKER ROOM AT MY GYM. After about 10 months here, I have accepted that they are relatively inconsiderate of others, they are loud, they pathologically break rules and laws, and I don't know how many times I've past a mom suspending her kid above the sidewalk to let the little guy do his business. Also, I live in Beijing, and I'm sure, no I know, it's gets worse the more rural you get. 
That being said, they have many other redeeming qualities. If you think you about what they've gone through in the last 70 years, it makes sense that their social etiquette hasn't caught up with their economic stature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a staffer, but still. We shared a flight to Hong Kong with this weird Buddhist monk. He was in full garb, ran around the plane the whole time, had a girl voice, and rapidly flipped through magazines. He wound up staying in my room at a hostel. He also jacked off to gay porn in broad daylight while people were present and awake. We asked him why, and he said in Chinese "It doesn't count. They're white." </TEXT>
