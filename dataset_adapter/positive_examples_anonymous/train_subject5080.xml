<TEXT> The only reason this happens is because I work 7-4 and instant oatmeal exists.  My work provides hot water and disposable coffee cups.  They also have a microwave and I have morningstar veggie sausages that I grab on the way out the door.  It also gives me an excuse to stall work for about 15 minutes while I prep and eat breakfast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOL Yeah I was planning on skipping the handstand progression altogether to start out.  One thing I liked about this program vs other bodyweight programs is that it had stuff like assisted squats whereas i've seen other bodyweight programs throw you into bulgarian splits and I'm like "yeah i wouldn't be getting up off the toilet after those" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had this exact routine about 6 years ago while I was on vacation from school.  The only thing that helped me was fasting as notoriousrdc said and then getting into a routine and sticking to it.

Also, **your bed is only for sleep and sex**.  Otherwise it will take you forever to actually fall asleep once you are ready to go to sleep because you've been in bed all day watching Netflix and your brain is like "so what, we've been doing this all day..."   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I've already asked around in their Moron Monday thread and they suggested modifying.  Their beginner routine already says to skip certain parts of the routine until you have mastered others.  I'm even going more basic, like doing fewer sets to start out so I don't hurt myself. </TEXT>

Home workouts work best for me and I've seen people recommend it.  I've also looked into SC at home, but I think I like the bodyweight fitness program better.  I just wanted some opinions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Went to Austin for girls' weekend with my two best friends and had a blast.  Walked a ton, it was hot as balls, swam in Barton Springs, took tons of pictures. Looking at the pictures I had some pretty big realizations about my health, though.  My appetite is pretty much gone and any cravings I get are pretty much squashed by looking at those pictures. Plus I have a cruise in December to look forward to and a son who I never want to ask me "Why are you so fat??"

Also, I want to move to Austin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am an obese , full-time-working new mom (as of 9 months ago).  The training guide seems very straightforward.  I have my diet under control thanks to MFP and am eating 1550 calories/day. I don't have any equipment whatsoever.  As I progress, I will be adding to the equipment so I can get in the workouts.

I guess my question is more general fitness-related.  Recently, whenever I've tried any new workout I usually end up so sore two days later that I can't get up off the toilet or out of my chair at work without serious grandma-ing.  It hurts to walk and do everything. The DOMS are so intense that I literally cannot pick up my child to change his diaper.  I'll admit, this usually leads to me thinking "shit, I can't deal with this, I have to be able to function" and am then on the lookout for another routine.

Should I take it easy and maybe not do all the strength sets the first week?

I work in an office and I had no excuse to not take in a packet of instant oatmeal and some frozen yakisoba noodles and frozen vegetables from costco.  So much cheaper, so fewer calories.  But before this week it's probably been almost every morning for the last 3 years (or at least 3 times per week).  Oh the money I could have saved.  I need to apologize to my husband. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the same reaction to the heartbeat as you.  Wasn't emotional or anything.  "That's pretty cool!"  I also had the same fears as you regarding not loving my child.  

You may not immediately connect with your baby.  It happens, and it's no big deal.  Motherhood may suck for a while, since the first couple of months your baby eats, poops, sleeps, and cries.  How much he/she does of each depends on your baby.

If you put effort into it and make sure you take care of yourself mentally and take care of the needs of your baby you will get there.  You will probably connect with your child.  

I had a small group of 3 friends that I constantly texted with before I was married and then we kept in touch until before I was pregnant and now that my son is 9 months.... we're doing a girls weekend this weekend.  We are still the same.  They love my son, they love seeing pictures and seeing him in person and hearing about him.  We still talk and do all the normal things.  I may not have been able to see them as much as I was able to before, but that's ok.  Things change.

You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.  However, social development is important for your child and that means interacting with other children.  That may mean chatting with their mothers/fathers/guardians and being polite and listening to their conversations while your child learns to play with other children.

I'm being 100% honest with you here in saying that one aspect of being a mother is giving up some selfishness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's always the possibility if his wife gained a lot more weight over a certain period of time and other things were affected (like libido) that depression could have a lot to do with it.  A very active person suddenly get depressed, doesn't want to cook for herself, doesn't want to get up and do anything as much, and the weight is very easy to put on in that case.  I would say if his wife gained the weight recently and she's open to seeing a doctor that she go see a GP, get a full hormone and lipid panel and the doctor may ask how she's feeling emotionally and may refer her to a mental health specialist.

That's at least how it went with me. </TEXT>

I don't want to miss much time with him so I'm considering doing blogilates' beginner program for 4 weeks since I'm so fucking out of shape, it's been like 18 months since I've been "in shape".  Then maybe transitioning to Strong Curves.

I'm also fucking exhausted.  I admitted to my therapist last week that I have an eating disorder (BN) that has developed over the last 3 months or so, so I'm in therapy and on a medication for that which of course makes me feel even more tired.  But I can do 25-30 minutes a day to start out...

We are very progressive in our beliefs, I actually lean more towards universalism nowadays.  I want to raise him in the community of the church without the shame that I was raised with as a Southern Baptist that was always being told that sex is dirty and evil.  

I much prefer the way the Lutheran church handles it.  We had him baptized at 6 months, and when he goes through Confirmation classes around 13 years old or so he can decide for himself if he feels that he wants to continue with his spiritual journey in Christianity or if he wants to move on.  I don't want to pressure him into believing something blindly like I was pressured as a child. </TEXT>

He&#8217;ll laugh and say that he can&#8217;t sleep

And he don&#8217;t know the reason why

Maybe it&#8217;s the evil eye

Oh, that awful, evil eye

Remember how he used to hold you close

Now in the middle of the night

Oh, the evil eye

Oh, that awful, evil eye

Someone must really have it in for him

The way they&#8217;re sticking him with pins [claws]

Oh, ooh

Now we sing to our son, and replace any word possible with Rhys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am 235lbs at 5'5.  Obese.  I love weight lifting and have seen results from it in the past, but recently had a kid (ok, 9 mos ago) and am ready to get back to it.  

The book suggests I eat 11 x 235 = 2585 calories to lose weight.  I plan on doing a 3 lift week and 3 days of walking, is this still too much to eat?

Also it says to eat 1g of protein for every pound of body weight, not lean body mass.  So I have to eat 235g of protein a day?

The IIFYM calculator says to eat 1880 calories for moderate weight loss with 3 days/week of working out.  I'm just a little confused.  I figure I'll try 1880 this week and if I'm just extremely ravenous I may up it, I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been through potty training our son yet but this is from personal experience.

My #1 tip is if he's not ready and having lots of accidents, don't force him to stay in big boy underwear.  I was forced into panties at 3 years old and was terrified of having an accident, so I held in my poop (also called encopresis).  This led to painful trips to the bathroom and it was a vicious cycle that wasn't fixed until I had sheer willpower at the age of 12.  Now my mom says she should have listened to her friends and put me back in pull-ups.  They had literally tried everything, including rewards, punishments, etc... and nothing worked.

I know this isn't typical, I'm just passing on the information from my mom.   </TEXT>

We may be having a little less sex now but I feel that we are connecting more emotionally than before.  I put the less sex on me as I am still really struggling with feeling sexy and losing the baby weight.  

I was terrified he would check out because he didn't want kids to begin with but he wanted to marry me more than he wanted to remain child free.  We compromised on one, we probably won't have any more.  The first couple of months were a struggle because newborns are basically pooping, crying potatoes.  But we fought through those months together and now we have the most amazing, intelligent, curious boy and we both adore him and adore each other so much.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It helps manage cravings by reducing the amount of insulin that is secreted because there is no blood glucose.  Increasing blood glucose (whether by gluconeogensis or just eating carbohydrates) triggers insulin secretion.  If blood sugar is increased because of cortisol, insulin secretion increases, which leads to a little fluid retention.

<TEXT> So if a person doing low-carb had an increase in cortisol from a stressful event, they could potentially be knocked out of ketosis from the rise in blood sugar from gluconeogenises, which may result in some weight gain from fluid retention that usually happens when, for example, someone doing keto has a cheat day (holy run-on sentence).  But nothing like the 50+ lbs that this guy has gained. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What does the role of cortisol play in all of this?  I've recently started a (doctor suggested) ketogenic lifestyle and have been listening to podcasts for motivation.  There is one big proponent of low carb (Jimmy Moore) who has recently packed on the pounds and claims it's all to do with not getting enough sleep and being stressed about his book deadlines.  He's also a big proponent of "calories don't matter when you're doing low-carb", whereas I think it's bullshit, that you still need to count calories even while doing low carb.  Do his excuses carry any weight? </TEXT>

Honestly my mental health couldn't have taken being off my medication along with the hard work breastfeeding is. Thankfully every medical professional and all my mom friends said that the mom's mental well being is so much more important to the baby than what it's being fed.

<TEXT> 1. To be able to take selfies with my friends when we're together and not dread the outcome

2. To be able to raise my son to be active and healthy without coming across as a hypocrite

3. Mental health benefits.  No more self-loathing, no more bingeing (sometimes coupled with purging)

4. To be able to shop for clothes that will usually look good on me (as a thinner person) than things that will rarely look good on me (mostly shapeless things)

5. To finally be able to say I'm a normal weight as an adult.  The closest I've been was 5 months after my dad unexpectedly passed away.  I was so heavily medicated and in grief that I didn't have an appetite.  I could drink a large coke from McD's and have a double cheeseburger and be fine for the day.

6. The reactions from people who haven't seen me in a long time.  Especially people who have been exceptionally mean to me for no reason.  Mainly one of my ex-friends whose last words to me were "go get more fat, bitch" (after I asked her to buy a $99 bridesmaids dress for my wedding).  Unfortunately I did get "more fat" (i think she said that because she thought it sounded more intelligent, even though "fatter" is correct), but now I'm getting less fat </TEXT>

<TEXT> My MIL is essentially our nanny. She comes over and watches our son all day. My husband works from home but it's not the kind of job he can do while taking care of a baby and she was a housewife while my husband and BIL were growing up. My son also spends the night at my in laws' every Friday. I see my mom every other week or so, since she works full time and lives 30 minutes away.  I should note my MIL offered to do this and loves doing it.  For the first few weeks I was super uncomfortable, thinking we were inconveniencing it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I have a slight nagging voice in the back of my head saying "I want food"

 Unusual to have this on keto. High satiety means physiologically you are more likely to feel full and not crave food. Possibly this is a withdrawal symptom. Possible the 'I need food' is more like 'I want carbs?' Many people have carb cravings (even dreams) as their addiction fades.

I had the same thing the first month I was on keto.  I've given up diet drinks this week and all of a sudden I'm so full and never want to eat.  I'd suggest ditching the artificial sweeteners as they can prompt an insulin response.

But diet soda was my jam, I could drink up to 10 a day.  Now it's tea with a slice of lemon, black coffee, or water.  Then again, I'm not even done with day 1 yet, but hopefully i can stick with this restriction </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone else doing keto with no artificial sweeteners?  I did keto (at 1600 calories) for a month and saw 2 lbs change.  Now I'm cutting out artificial sweeteners to see if that makes a difference (since some scientists think it could prompt an insulin response in some people).  It's a lot harder than I thought!

<TEXT> Got off to a bad start and my mental health couldn't take it.  I was diagnosed with chorio during labor and the procedure is that the baby stays in NICU for 48 hours getting antibiotics to make sure he didn't develop an infection too.  When my water broke I had been awake for about 20 hours already (it was 1am) so by the time my son was born, I had been awake for about 40 hours.  I just crashed and told the nurses to formula feed.  

After finally getting him home after 4 days, I tried to pump but my mental stability wasn't back yet and having to pump every 2 hours, plus a frustrated baby who was used to getting the formula amount and was getting my measly drops... I just decided fuck it, he'll be fine with formula.  

I also need psychiatric meds to manage my anxiety, which I would have preferred to stay on.  I don't regret it at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hit my one month keto mark earlier this week and am down a whopping 3 lbs.  I've basically been stalled for 3 weeks and have tried giving up different things, adding more fat, everything.  It's hard.  I know I'll have to stick with it til I lose the weight because I have PCOS and insulin resistance, but it's really frustrating.  These past 2 days I've been so close to just cheating because I'd probably just gain the 3lbs of water weight back.  Last week I ate a little too much PB that took me to 35g of carbs, I was still registering as in ketosis, but I woke up the next morning to a 4 lb weight gain.  

This diet can be so effortless for some bc the weight just slips off but for some of us it's as hard as restricting other things on other diets and seeing crap results.  At least the cravings are gone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm starting all over today.  The last half of 2013 I was into SL and was doing it consistently.  Then at Christmas I fell off the wagon and in March 2014 I found out I was pregnant.  Now my son is 7 months old and I need to finally lose all this extra weight.  I'm doing keto per my endocrinologist's suggestion.  My weak point has always been squats and I plan on starting with body weight or goblet squats until I'm happy enough with my form to move on to barbell.

Does this sound reasonable?  I want to get back into SS or SL because it's the only exercise I've ever done that I truly enjoy and see consistent results from.  Any tips on getting my squats back?  If I'm not working out my ankles seem to lock up and don't have much mobility to them so I was planning on doing severe incline walking to warm up.  

Just lay on all the advice you can give me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, all the low carb substitutions for carb laden products (like ice cream, tortillas, candy, etc...) are what made me fail so many times. Test the effects on weight loss and blood ketones. I always registered as trace ketones on the ketostix, low on the blood ketone monitor when I ate that stuff. I'm doing it with no subs now and I'm losing a lot more quickly.  They must have elicited a slight insulin response in me.  I loved the subs because as a carb addict I could still have things similar to my favorite things. 

Just be careful!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My situation is not typical, but I figured I'd put it out there.

Up front costs are big, as you may have to furnish a new room, as well as get things like a car seat, stroller, etc...  Monthly costs can be expensive, I'd look into Amazon  subscriptions for things like diapers and possibly formula (we use Honest Company subscription for diapers).  If your wife can BF, go for it.

Day care will be the #1 biggest expense by far.  It's like college tuition that you can't take out federal loans for.  We really lucked out, my MIL was a stay at home mom and now that she's an empty nester, she volunteered to watch my son while my husband and I are at work for free.  My husband works from home but wouldn't have the time to entertain   care for the baby and work, so my MIL just comes over every day from 9-5.  If there is anyone in your family who would volunteer to care for the baby for you, TAKE THEM UP ON IT.  We were very hesitant to at first, thinking we would be a burden.  After the first day I went back to work we decided we need someone.

You can get clothes super cheap on ebay or Craigslist.  Don't buy certain things used, like car seats or other safety equipment.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do not jump into buying a house and having kids until you are both at least somewhat happy with where you are.  Unless it's a specialized field, it's not difficult to get a job with a "useless" degree.  You just have to turn your work experience around and maybe work on some skills outside of work to make the most of your resume.

Tell her to apply at other school districts, any district within 30 miles.  I've known teachers who had to commute an hour to get to the district they worked in, because the were offered a job in a grade that they wanted and the school district was good.  

See if she'd be open to applying for an administrative position in a school district, too.  It would get her out of having to deal with behavioral problems or angry parents.

I'm coming to you as a mother of a 6 month old.  I am not a stay at home mom, my husband and I both work.  It is EXHAUSTING having to get up and go to work, then come home and take care of a baby when you love your job.  When you hate your job and are unfulfilled, it's 10 times worse.   </TEXT>

While I didn't consider myself child-free, I am not the most nurturing person ever.  I have a 6 month old son and I often times feel bad because of how easy he is.  We are strongly considering our son to be an only child because of the whole "what if the next one is a nightmare?" thought process.  I'm not strong mentally, I have anxiety and depression issues.  I really really lucked out with my son, too.  I don't know how I would handle a difficult baby. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every recruiter, HR professional, hiring manager, and CEO/President I've talked to said at the beginning of your career you can afford to job hop and it won't look like you're being flaky or a bad employee.

I just started a new job yesterday, and I've been out of college for 3.5 years.  I've had 3 jobs since then:

1. Contract position as a clerk in the accounting department (7 months)
2. Technical assistant, basic help desk support and applications administration (10 months)
3. Document controller and application administrator (2 years)

Now I just started a job as a Business Systems Analyst, something that took me 4 years to figure out I actually wanted to do.

If she needs to figure out what she wants to do, she may have to hop around a bit, but now is the absolute time to do it.  I only know a small handful of people who stayed at their first few jobs for more than 2 years after college. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty well, actually.  Started out as an Engineering major in college.  Failed out of a state school's Engineering program (after a bout of depression and my father's unexpected death), got into a university in my home town after a semester of community college and majored in Math.  Had no idea what I was going to do with a Math degree with no minor (no finance or CS experience).  Everyone suggested I teach, but I had no desire to teach. 

I'm good with computers, and am fairly intelligent and good at interviews, so I went from making $17/hour out of college as data entry (in 2011) to $75k as an application administrator for a big O G company with great advancement prospects.

While I may not be passionate about applications administration, it's not something I completely loathe doing.  I don't mind going to work every day.  I get to travel a couple of times a year to great places for my job, I get great benefits, and I make enough that my family is comfortable (along with my husband's salary).   </TEXT>

Now I am going to one and the mom to be has registries, but none of them have a rock n play. From experience and talking to other moms, the rock n play has been a godsend. They have a bouncer seat and swing on the registries...

I personally didn't mind when people went off registry and got things we didn't register for.  But I wanted to hear others' opinions before doing this. 

EDIT: Thanks!  I'll be getting her a gift card and telling her about the rock n play but let her decide on her own instead.  I'll also probably get a cute outfit or book to go with the gift card. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anecdotal:  I need advancement opportunities.  The first 3 jobs I had out of college have been stagnant.  The job I'm currently at pays well enough, but I have nowhere to go in this company.  I will be starting at a job in 2 weeks as a Jr. associate (to keep it vague), so there are multiple levels for me to advance to and then more opportunity from there.  It's less about the money and more about seeing progress in my career.  I'm aware I'll probably get to a point in my career where I'm comfortable at my level, but I need to see some advancement at some point. </TEXT>

That was recommended to me by a friend, whose pediatrician recommended it.  It's so much cheaper than name brand but just as good.

Honestly, even if I tried to do keto I wouldn't have been able to.  I had awful aversions to anything high in fat or high in protein.  Honestly, she needs to ask her doctor's opinion and follow it.  While keto is great for regulating hormones for PCOS and losing weight, she has more important things to worry about.  Her doctors will be monitoring her hormones and supplementing as needed.   </TEXT>

I couldn't even get out the 1.8 ounces that are best for baby's immune system.  Also I would only be able to BF for 6 weeks, as my company is really small and doesn't have a place for mothers to pump.  Every lactation consultant and expert I talked to said that a mother's mental health is much more important for baby than breast milk.  Turns out my baby is allergic to milk protein anyways, so he would have had to be on a food allergy formula anyways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Completely agree.  I have this acquaintance who is arguing with DOCTORS in the comments of a post she made with an article about how MMR vaccinations kill more than the measles itself.  Her family has had some medical problems and with things like a false-negative RSV test and other things she is very distrusting of modern medicine, and she even has an 8 month old who has to have open heart surgery soon.  And she's still refusing to vaccinate her other 2 kids and she refuses to get the booster herself.  She will instead quarantine her entire family for 6 weeks after her daughter's surgery to avoid the germs from the outside world.

It's infuriating.  That's what vaccines are for! They are needed to protect those people who CAN'T get vaccinated, like her daughter in those weeks after the surgery.

<TEXT> Red flags:

* "He then changed his mind around 25 weeks, saying he needed me to work"

Why?? If he was making the same amount of money, what big change happened that made him realize he needed your income?  

* "He got off the phone and told me he had just locked us into a $200 a month contract for 2 years"

If he can't refuse the salespeople's schtick, he should not have any accounts in his name.  Any time he calls in to customer service they will usually try to sell him additional services.  This is a huge red flag and shows that your husband makes very poor financial decisions

* "He won&#8217;t even give me a complete break down of all our monthly expenses, to see myself if we can make staying at home work or not."

Why the fuck not?  This is the absolute biggest red flag to me as it seems to indicate he may be hiding something from you.  Maybe a spending problem, maybe something bigger like a gambling problem.  But you are an equal part in your relationship and you have a right to see what all your money is going towards.  Do you not have access to the checking account to see the list of transactions?  I would demand access first and foremost.

* " I haven&#8217;t drove my car in 3 months, only his, and he refuses to let me sell the piece of junk to cut out the insurance payment, and put some extra money in our pockets"

Is the car in your name, his name, or both? If the car isn't being driven, there's no reason to keep it around, especially with an insurance payment.  Why does he get to make all the financial calls when you are working and bringing income in?  I could *maybe* **maybe** understand if you were a SAHM and had no income, but since you are a contributor to the finances of your household, you have the right to see where your money is going.


You are not being irrational.  I would be resentful of my husband, too, if I were in your shoes.  I am also a working mom of a 3 month old and miss my son every day.  My husband works from home and while I'm jealous of him getting to be around Rhys all day, I don't resent him because he treats me like an equal partner.  Your husband is treating you like a child and it's unacceptable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't be trusting all the money stuff with someone who has that much credit card debt in the first place.  I mean, sometimes it's unavoidable, I've been there.  But to refuse to let your spouse in on the budget is a HUUUGE red flag to me.  I'd say he has a spending problem or something similar.  Why else would he want to hide the finances from her? </TEXT>

I'm constantly working on it, but as someone who also suffers from depression and anxiety who uses food as a crutch, there are deeper issues that need treatment as well.  I'm sure there are people out there who can go "Oh, I'm eating too much, let me stop doing that!" and lose weight.  I am not one of them, and I'd be willing to bet that the majority of obese persons don't fall into that category.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> After giving birth I'm getting back into lifting.  Before I was pregnant, my husband and I would go to the gym together after work and do SL.  Now that we have the kid it's really difficult to go to the gym together.  He's uneasy about me doing SL by myself because I'll eventually need a spotter for bench.  Deadlifts and squats are no big deal because I use a power rack.  

My question is this: 

Are there any other lifting programs that wouldn't require a spotter for any of the exercises?  I really liked the simplicity of SL and the lack of things I really hate (like lunges).  Should I just do SL with dumbbells?  Should I tell my husband "I got it" and do SL with barbells?  

The biggest obstacle here is being intimidated, socially anxious, and extremely shy.  If I have to ask for a spot from some rando I will probably throw up, so I'd prefer not to have to do that.  I know I'm a wuss and I should suck it up but I already feel like an impostor as a 240lb female and have pretty severe anxiety about that sort of thing.++


Edit: THANKS!   Will be learning roll of shame or to ditch the weights on either side if i get stuck on bench. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see it as very tricky.  As /u/namer98 said, the OT commands it.  But there is contradictory information in the NT like /u/I3lindman brought up.  Is deadly self-defense technically repaying evil for evil? Peter used it when the soldiers came to take Jesus away and he was rebuked for doing so.  However, Humans were given the right to exact the death penalty for murder ( John 19:10-11 ; Rom 13:1-4 ).  

In the OT, even a thief could be killed in self-defense. Jesus commanded his disciples to arm themselves and the only time Jesus was recorded in rebuking the use of a sword was when Peter was trying to get in the way of Christ's specific purpose to lay down His life.

Honestly, if it came down to it I would absolutely use deadly force to protect myself or my family if their lives were being threatened by someone.  I don't know if it's a sin, but I know I would go through severe mental anguish if that situation were to become a reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the sake of his daughter he needs to form a bond with her, and that means sucking it up and dealing with her when she cries.  He needs to learn how to soothe her.  My dad didn't help out at all when I was a baby, he never changed a diaper or fed me or anything, and I grew up semi-afraid of him and I didn't trust him at all.  I know it's anecdotal, but maybe it'll help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some questions:

1. Do you have other employees that work in the office with you?

2. Is your office pretty sound-proof when you close the door?

If you have other employees in your building but outside your office door and your office isn't mostly sound-proof, I would think very hard about this decision.  It could definitely mess with the other employee's morale and be annoying to hear a baby cry what could be every 15 minutes, even if you deal with the baby quickly.   </TEXT>

edit:  Since IUGR affects a baby&#8217;s growth since they&#8217;re not getting the nutrients they need, it ABSOLUTELY DOES affect their development. A 4 pound baby is smaller and weaker than an 8 pound baby every single time. Dating ultrasounds are more accurate than ovulation and LMP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are some things that can cause a substantially slower metabolism.  Specifically in females, PCOS coupled with insulin resistance has showed to reduce BMR up to 700 calories/day.

I have this and multiple endocrinologists have told me that the only way I will be able to lose weight is by eating an extremely low carb diet, and either exercise daily or eat around 1300 calories if I don't.  So that's what I'm doing. 

The reason that they suggest low carb is because when people with insulin resistance eat carbs, more insulin than needed is excreted in the bloodstream, leaving an excess amount of insulin after carbs have been digested.  Excess insulin can leave you with an unbelievable craving for more carbs, so you eat more.

<TEXT> Why are parents such shitheads sometimes?  I would imagine for a child's birthday they usually request RSVPs so they can plan for stuff like food and goody bags.  So that means 30 parents RSVP'd and 29 parents flaked/forgot.

If anyone ever does that to my kid I'm going to call the parents out on their rude behavior. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always assume I look like the ass I see in pictures.  When I look in the mirror I'm seeing something different than the world sees (even if just slightly so).  In front of the mirror I'm standing still, not interacting with the world, usually not even talking.  All those things I do when I'm not in front of the mirror affect my appearance.  

So while I may feel attractive when I look in the mirror in the morning, I know from seeing pictures and videos of myself that I'm an ok looking fat girl.  I would say I was hideous and weird looking if it weren't for my husband insisting I am beautiful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so glad you went into that. I have a 7 week old. No co sleeping allowed, no loose blankets, no unsupervised Tummy time. I feel a lot better now that I have read what you wrote about SIDS. 

Edit: how dare I find solace in a stranger's words! How dare I follow the American pediatrics association's recommendations for safe sleeping! I don't cosleep because I am overweight and move a lot in my sleep. I don't trust my unconscious self enough to sleep in the same bed with my infant. If you are different, great for you. But I take solace in her words because it's healthier for me than to stay awake worrying every night for the next 10 months. If SIDS does exist, I'm doing everything recommended to avoid it, so worrying won't get me anywhere.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have bookmarked this to listen to tonight after work because this topic is of great importance to me.  Mental illness runs pretty rampant in my family.  My father had severe depression and anxiety, and both my sister and I seem to have inherited it, albeit to a lesser degree (thankfully).  The church I grew up in (Southern Baptist megachurch) seemed to brush off mental illness as an indication that Satan was on the attack.  Every time I would bring up my illness to anyone at church or my extended family, I would be told to just pray it out, that Satan was clearly attacking me and my family.  

After high school and in college I finally got some real help outside the church, through CBT and medication.  I am currently on anti-depressants for anxiety and depression, and I am a member of a church that recognizes that mental illness needs to be treated the same as physical illnesses, with medical intervention as well as prayers of encouragement.

Because there was a lot of healing prayer done in my sake in my grade school years, I am very skeptical of healing prayer's effect overall in any situation. It is absolutely unacceptable in my opinion to offer prayer instead of medical intervention.  Many people I grew up with would agree with that in the case of physical illness, but with mental illness prayer is the only necessity to overcome it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately it seems that there is no solution to the problems at hand.  It seems like a majority of the active users want you to step down, but you refuse (for seemingly no other reason other than how much time you've put in to the subreddit).  So basically there are 3 options: mass exodus to a new subreddit that shares the same function, conducting a protest by not participating in the subreddit until things change, or just shrug and move along.  The third option is obviously what will happen, so why even bring attention to this ordeal at all? Why not just stay silent on the matter, say "good riddance," and try to find a moderator team that will go along with what you and brucemo want? 

If you don't care about what the community wants, why even involve the community at all in the behind-the-scenes happenings?  It seems like you think you know what's best for the community.  </TEXT>

There are things that I still don't "get", like the Lutheran view of Communion ("in, with, and under") and some things I may not agree with some Lutherans on (like the implications of infant baptism).

After we got married we looked at how the LCMS (and our home church in particular) was being run and our views on social matters like LGBT and we decided to make the switch to ELCA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to disagree with everyone here about the calories.

If your doctor suggested that low, I say go for it.  Plenty of morbidly obese people jump start their weight loss with doctor-supervised diets with crazy low calories.  That's just what your diet is, doctor supervised.  Your doctor isn't an idiot, he is highly educated in metabolic disorders and he suggested it for a reason.  Whether it be because your BMR is lower due to PCOS (see below) or as a means to reduce your stomach size and make you fuller faster, I would personally take his advice.

[Also, there have been studies performed on PCOS's effect on BMR, and it has been shown that women with PCOS and insulin resistance have a BMR lower than the average non PCOS/IR woman by as much as 700 calories.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18678372)  So if an average woman burns 1800 calories/day at your weight, you may actually only burn 1100 calories/day.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely agree with you.  I'm a Christian and the whole point about being a Christian is that we are absolutely imperfect and sinners.  Yes, we as Christians should strive to be more like Jesus, but it's impossible to not be sinners.  Honestly, if I was called out by someone who didn't share my faith I would be a little peeved, because the person calling me out doesn't share the same perspective I do.  Call me out on just being a bad human being if I am, don't bring my faith into it unless you're another Christian who I also consider a good friend trying to keep me accountable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, my husband did.  We were juniors in college and had known each other since 7th grade.  We dated for 6 months in 9th grade until I dumped him, but we stayed best friends.  During college I would hang out with him when we were both home and we would usually end up making out most of the time.  I had made up my mind, though, that I wouldn't date him or be with him and let him know.

During the fall semester, I saw on facebook that he had entered a relationship with a girl I knew he was only with because he was lonely.  I realized how much I cared for him when I saw that post.  It was like a punch to the gut.  So I called him up and professed my love for him, knowing he loved me back.

He called his gf that night and dumped her and we started dating immediately.  We didn't make it social media official for a few months so that we wouldn't hurt the other girl's feelings by immediately bragging.  

Got married a couple years later and now have a 7 week old son together.  I don't regret it at all.  I am sorry I went about it the way I did, by hurting another girl.   </TEXT>

You may either be ravenous and want to eat as much as you did before, or you may get really full really quickly due to the high fat content.  Don't worry about calories these first couple of weeks, just work on getting keto adapted.

I will admit we are encouraging a little more sleep during the day, which i think is starting to backfire and keep him awake at night.

My husband smokes, and he smokes every day.  He only smokes when he has his free time, even though he works from home. If his pot smoking got in the way of his responsibilities around the house, I would have a different opinion. But if he's pulling his weight, I'm fine with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just had my baby and I didn't qualify for FMLA because the company I work for is only 24 people (minimum to guarantee is 50).  I am taking 6 weeks off (in addition to 4 weeks of mandated bed rest), all I needed was a note from the doctor.  I didn't even have to bring anything in, I just gave my doctor the number to our HR person and they took care of everything.  

Granted it differs from company to company, but I guess I lucked out with mine because I'll be going back after the mandated 6 weeks.  The leave is just considered non-FMLA </TEXT>

<TITLE> My birth story! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-21 03:50:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had my little man, Rhys Adam, on Wednesday, 10/15, at 37+3.  

On 9/15 I had an appointment with my OB and my BP was 140/90.  I was sent to L D triage for monitoring and it was determined I just had a little gestational hypertension (no pre-e!).  So my doctor put me on modified bed rest and I was officially starting my maternity leave.

At my 36 week appointment, my doctor did a cervical check and said my cervix was thin but not dilated.  Two days previous I had lost my mucous plug, but I knew not to hold my breath.  At my 37 week appointment it was the same thing, thin cervix, still pretty high.

Tuesday I got what I now assume was the nesting bug.  I didn't furiously clean, I just straightened up, finished washing all the clothes, ran a couple of errands, but still stayed mostly seated/relaxed.  I hadn't been doing anything to get labor started.  No dates, no pineapple, no castor oil, nothing.  I decided it had been too long since getting busy with the husband so we got down to business.  I couldn't sleep, so I stayed up watching Netflix.  At about 1am I decided it was time to crawl into bed.  I lift one leg onto the bed and feel a trickle that was definitely NOT urine.  So I tell my husband, stand around for a little, and there was another small gush.  We pack up and head to the hospital because I didn't want to wait around with broken water.

We get to the hospital and I have to check in at the ER before they take me to L D triage.  As I was sitting filling out the check in form... GUSH.  Water broken, no doubt about it.  We get to L D triage and it's confirmed.  L D was pretty busy around that time so we hung out for a few hours until they got a room prepared for us.  We arrived at L D triage at 1:40am and got put in a room around 3:30am.  I wasn't having any contractions so they started pitocin.  My mom and MIL arrived at 5:40am.

Around 7am the contractions really started and I was dilated up to 3cm.  I asked for something for the pain and they gave me Stadol and Zofran. As the contractions ramped up, I realized the stadol was doing nothing for me.  I was squeezing DH's hand, and everything was incredibly annoying during the contractions.  They must have been about a minute apart.

At 8:30am I couldn't take any more.  I was at 4cm and I got my epidural.  Sweet relief.  The next 8 hours or so I just continued dilating, watching HGTV, and chatting with my family.  Around 4:30pm I noticed I was getting the shivers but I assumed it was from the epidural.  At 5pm it was confirmed I was at 10cm and it was time to start pushing, but I had started running a fever.  My nurse told me if i gets above 99.5 then I would have something called Chorioamnionitis.  Basically since my water had been broken so long and I'd had a few cervical checks, I started getting an infection.  Not much later my fever bypassed that.  They started me on some antibiotics while I started pushing.

Doctor checked me at 10cm and made a comment about how narrow my pelvis was, commenting about my pubic bone and the position.  He said we'll probably have to do a c-section but we can start pushing.

Pushing wasn't too bad honestly. I had great coaches in my husband and the awesome L D nurse I had. I just felt like a softball was passing painlessly through my vagina.  At 6pm the doctor came back in with the delivery team and everyone started preparing for little man's arrival.  At 6:17pm he was born.  6lb 11.5oz, 19.75 inches.  He had a fever from the chorio, but otherwise he was perfect.  

I had an episiotomy and 2nd degree tear.  I'm so in love with this little guy that everything I went through was so worth it.

Because of the chorio, he had to stay 48 hours in the NICU.  His blood cultures were monitored and once both of us were pumped full of antibiotics and determined to be infection free, we got to go home Friday night!  His bilirubin levels were a little high so we had to go back in for a test on Saturday morning.  He barely passed, but we decided to do 24 hours of phototherapy anyways because he wasn't eating as much as he needed to in order to get rid of the jaundice.

He came home for good yesterday morning at 10am and it's been wonderful ever since!

<TEXT> If it gets to the point where it's interfering with your day to day life, you need to tell your doctor about it (whether it be your GP or OB).  Occasional anxiety is normal, but when it's every day and gets in the way of your life, it needs more attention.  Some medications are safe during pregnancy and breast feeding and your mental health is of utmost importance right now and after you deliver baby. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes.  I had a history of anxiety and depression beforehand, and I weaned off my meds in month 2.  Month 6 rolls around and BAM, anxiety is back worse than ever.  I'm now on low dose Prozac to help.

But anxiety during pregnancy is common, even for those people who haven't experienced it before.  Just take deep breaths and breathe for as long as it takes to pass.  Don't take your pulse during this time, it just causes a negative feedback loop.  That is, you feel your pulse, you feel it's fast, and you panic because it's fast, causing it to go faster.

I have to take my BP twice daily due to gestational hypertension, and honestly my pulse is anywhere between 90 and 115.  Doctor said this is fine, as your heart rate during pregnancy is going to increase due to more blood in your body.

Just deep breaths, everything will be fine.  If you do realize something is triggering them, just tell yourself "panicking will do nothing to help the situation."  Stay away from Dr. Google. </TEXT>

I took it until 6 weeks pregnant and then I was on progesterone supplementation because my progesterone was low.  All of my reproductive endocrinologist, general practitioner, and OB said to go off it.  Who am I to argue with all that education?

<TEXT> Well today we got word that we got approved for the rental house we applied for.  About 30 minutes after getting the news, I took a nap.  In my dream, my husband was sleeping in the guest room (with no marital issues) but the one caveat was that the owner of the house ran a boutique out of the guest room, so my husband had to be up and out of the room by 5:30am every day, which never happens.  So there was a big fight about that.

Then I had to participate in a karaoke contest, but the focus was on the lipstick color I decided to wear during my performance.  The judge/host was a tyrant and wouldn't let me choose my song and wouldn't tell me when I was going on stage.  I also couldn't find my favorite lipstick that looks awesome on me, so I started breaking down into tears, screaming at the woman about how unfair it was.

WTF brain...

Previous pregnancy dreams include:

Recurring dream of having to get a c-section, but the doctor can't get to the baby so they just sew me back up and shrug, saying "maybe next time!"

Giving birth, and within 2 hours my baby is driving a car (as a baby-sized human), talking, crawling, walking, etc...

Giving birth to a baby whose body, when swaddled, is the size shape of a baguette, but whose head is the size of a large olive.  Can't breast feed, I have to feed him with an eye dropper and he projectile vomits after every feeding.

Freaking terrifying. </TEXT>

We were also in a LDR at the time. He told me recently that once he almost dropped me off after a weekend together and was going to call it off but he decided not to. The next week I started weaning off zoloft and things got dramatically better. Lower dose celexa works so much better for me anyways.

It is pointless and a waste of energy. Nothing bad is going to happen" and do your breathing. Breathe through it until it's over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Female here, who believes in gender equality:

Why not call it gender egalitarianism, then?  Feminism exists only to increase advantages of the female gender.  While I agree that in most aspects, men have the advantage, why aren't feminists trying to reduce the stigma attached with, say, male elementary teachers?  Or any male workers around children?  I've heard personal anecdotes of men being accused of being pedophiles for taking pictures of their daughters at public parks. If feminism was truly about gender equality, we would also hear more about certain inequalities that men face where women have the advantage and work to fix those things as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is sexual compatibility already determined before someone has sex?  If libido has been discussed before two virgins get married (like, how much each person thinks about sex) and it is determined they are a good match in that regard, there is still room for sexual incompatibility?  Learning about one's sexual identity with another person who is brand new to the game too can be a fun and exciting experience.

Not to mention the fact that sex may not have as much importance in a relationship as it does to you.   </TEXT>

Maybe sit close by the door and take deep breaths, try to assure yourself this won't go on forever.

Try opening and clenching your hands, sometimes getting blood out of your torso can help.  </TEXT>

The 3 months I was there I couldn't find a job despite trying for 8 hours every day, applying for the lowliest jobs u could. Had to have my parents bail me out of my lease and I moved back home to finish school while living with them. Should've just been a commuter student from the time I graduated high school.

Yes, some HOAs can be ridiculous, but most of the ones I have come across simply maintain the neighborhood to a certain standard. I don't want to live in a neighborhood where my neighbor can go months without mowing his lawn, because it makes the neighborhood look like shit. Same with putting a sofa on the front lawn or other things that make the rest of the neighborhood look trashy. 

Some are ridiculous though. My in laws are remodeling their house and they had to fill out forms to get approval for all the renovations.  If I want new countertops, that should be my decision only as it doesn't affect how the rest of the neighborhood looks.  </TEXT>

At least I have a lot of baby shower stuff to catalog, snacks to eat, and a good book to read.

<TEXT> Haven't had my baby yet but had to pay my deductible to my OB, which was $1800.  I got another bill from the hospital saying I'll owe $600.  The bill I paid to my OB covered vaginal delivery, his appointments and services before baby is born and one post partum appointment.  Doesn't cover any of the hospital expenses.  We'll probably end up being billed around $2800 total including deductible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every day, every hour I feel the same way.  My husband does too.  There are times we look at each other and go "what the fuck did we do??" and it gets scarier as it gets closer.

The only thing that is consoling me is that there are people out there who are in worse situations than I am (and who are worse people than I am) who somehow raise healthy children.  I'm also judgey and I have certain acquaintances who are mothers and I find myself thinking "if SHE can do it, I can do it."   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your story sounds identical to mine.  I was on 30mg Celexa before getting pregnant.  Weaned off around 12 weeks pregnant, then in late July my panic came back full force.  I am currently on 10mg of Prozac.  It's much better for baby and me to not be stressed out all the time than for the baby to come into contact with a little bit of an SSRI.  I know people who have had anxiety so severe that they stayed on Klonopin during their pregnancy and their child turned out fine.  

I'm currently 36 weeks, and I still have moments of anxiety, but the medication definitely helps.  I couldn't function at work, my blood pressure was up.  I knew I needed help.  I went back to my psychiatrist and we both decided it was the best route to go for the end of this pregnancy.  This also gives a jump start on helping with PPA or PPD.  Since it's such a low dose it shouldn't affect baby that much at all.

<TEXT> While I agree with you on every other point, the environmental impact has been widely debated.  So from a frugality point, yes cloth are more cost effective.  But environmentally the jury is still out when you take into account the laundering of the diapers.  Most say they have the same effect on the environment:

Keeping a child clad in home-laundered cloth diapers for 2.5 years emitted 1,232 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, vs. 1,380 pounds for disposable diapers.

<TEXT> I have suffered from anxiety and depression for the last 4 year or so.  I tried to get off my antidepressants, but I was so stressed that it was having a negative effect on my health.  

One thing my psychiatrist says can really help avoid PPD is getting 6 hours of sleep a night after baby arrives.  Obviously this may not be possible for everyone, but if you can, have your SO or someone be on baby duty for as long as possible per day.  

Also, anti-depressants are not the end of the world.  I'm on Prozac now at 34 weeks and will be on it after I give birth, too.  If I can't BF on it, my mental well being is much more important for baby than breast milk.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Too many medical questions for my OB? Anxiety about pregnancy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-24 19:40:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently I was diagnosed with pregnancy hypertension.  My BP is fine now that I'm on modified bed rest, but ever since that happened I'm hyper aware of every ache and pain.  I'm sitting more than I'm up but I still might be up for a while each day to make sure I'm moving.

Yesterday for about 5 minutes I had a weird, not-severe pain in my left foot.  No swelling, but it felt like it was a swelling pain.  Pressure pain, tight, squeezing.  I've heard about DVT and one foot swelling.  I was told that because I'm on modified bed rest I shouldn't experience any swelling.  

The pain has only happened again once since yesterday, for less time and less severe.  I'm just concerned I'm asking my OB too many questions about stuff, like every minor ache and pain.

Should I call a nurse's line instead?  Should I just wait and see if the pain gets to be more severe?  My OB practice is one doctor and one nurse, very small, and pretty busy.   They're actually not even open today due to a birth.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently pregnant (34 weeks) and on low dose Prozac.  I had been weaned off Celexa by the 3rd month of my pregnancy, but my panic attacks came back very strongly so I was put on low dose Prozac to help.  I'm not concerned, though.  Stress on my body with constant panic isn't good for baby, and my doctors ultimately decided that the slight risk was ok.  Plus this study doesn't seem to be very reliable anyways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since it's a seminar, there are usually breaks.  You won't be the only one who is there alone, people may try to talk to you.  Just make small talk, maybe you'll find someone who shares an interest in things you like.  There will be a break for lunch.

I **highly** doubt they will call each of you by name.  You may need to wear a name tag.  They just need your information to confirm attendance.  

They will probably have different speakers to speak about different sub-topics of the seminar.  There may be 90 minute sessions with small breaks in between.  Usually questions should be saved for the end of each session if the floor is opened for questions.

Your anxiety will do nothing to make the experience better.  It'll do the opposite.  If you find yourself getting anxious, just take deep breaths through it for as long as it takes for you to settle down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a fellow nervous nellie who is far along in pregnancy:

STOP.  Stop taking your temperature.  Don't google every little symptom you have.  If you feel like something really isn't right, call your OB.  Otherwise you're most likely fine.  Worrying about it won't do anything to make it better, and your body needs to be as stress free as possible.  Just relax, it's going to be one hell of a ride from here on out :)

If you are getting nervous and ever need someone to talk to, PM me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today's my birthday. I had an appointment with my OB where my urine showed +1 for protein and BP was 140/75. Went to L D triage to be monitored. Everything showed perfect, lab results were perfect. 

Doctor decided to put me on modified bed rest anyways. So now I'm off work until I recover from delivery.  No exercising, no working, no heavy cleaning at home.  I can stand up, walk around and do stuff. 

This sucks. I'm such an antsy person. I can't stand being home for very long. I have stuff I can learn and work on while I'm at home, it just sucks. Thankfully there isn't a financial burden. And my husband works from home so I have company and help nesting. 

Guess I'll learn some VBA, crochet, work on the baby book, plan meals for my husband to cook, and feel my baby move a lot. 

Anyone else on bedrest? How do you stay sane??? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the last 3 weeks or so my outer ladybits have felt really sore. I'm currently 32 weeks, and it seems to happen mostly when I'm getting up or walking around.

<TEXT> The gist of it is this: husband notices I am snoring a lot in first trimester. Noticed one bout of apnea. Snoring continued into second trimester. I went to sleep doctor, did a home sleep test, results inconclusive and they didn't push my insurance to do a lab sleep test. Then the sleep tech at that sleep lab got really creepy, started sending me my results, pics of his son, and other creepy stuff. I reported him and made an appointment with a new doctor. 

I'm not gonna dance around it. I'm obese. But for the last month or so my snoring has completely gone away. No bouts of apnea that my husband has noticed. I have so much more energy lately, and all my leg movements during sleep are virtually gone. 

The new doctor got authorization for an in-lab sleep test, and the lab is super nice. But my anxiety has been up lately and I'm a little terrified to be away from my husband, hooked up to a ton of machines. 

What would you do if you were in my position? Go through with it? Or just cancel it since a majority of the symptoms are now gone? </TEXT>

I can't seem to get to that proper light yellow color that I keep hearing about.  I've been drinking one Powerade Zero daily (or using a nuun tablet) to get my electrolytes.  No swelling.

<TEXT> I was having such great success on Celexa, but due to baby being dependent and it messing up my chances of breastfeeding, I weaned off of it.  Everything was going really well for 2 months, but this last week has been hell.

I'm terrified of dying during childbirth.  I've looked up statistics and am just convinced I'm going to draw the short straw.  I'm already 28 weeks along, so I'm going to have to birth this baby no matter what.  It really doesn't help that my husband has the same fear, it just affects his life less than mine does.  He knows someone who almost died during childbirth so that is what drives his fear.

I'm giving birth at a branch of one of the top hospitals in the country.  The city I live in has the best medical center in the world.   Yet here I am, still panicking.

Any moms out there?  Can you help me out?  I'm going back to my therapist in a couple of weeks, but I need temporary sanity. </TEXT>

I got the kid's kind because I'm not a fan of fermented things.  One tiny bottle of it 2 days ago and my body is happy again.  It's like birds are singing.  I can get it at most grocery stores in my area.  Whole Foods has the most variety.

<TEXT> 21 weeks today and I can honestly say I've never been this exhausted in my life.  I work a desk job and have a hard time keeping my eyes open.  I slept 15 hours yesterday and 12 the day before.  

Could this be a sign of GD?  I get exceptionally tired after I have any carbs, which I'm very aware of from doing keto before getting pregnant.  I have had insulin resistance for the last 8 years.

I drink diet cokes for the caffeine, but they don't do much.  Coffee makes me jittery and anxious so I tend to stay away from it.  I did just finish weaning off my Celexa, maybe that has a hand in all of this.

On top of everything I ruined 90% of my maternity wardrobe from leaving a tube of lipstick in my jeans and then drying them with my maternity tops.  I just want to run home screaming and crawl into bed for the next 19 weeks.

HELP.

Edit: OK I'm so thankful to see it's not just me.  For those future mamas who work on your feet, you deserve a parade. I can barely make it through the day just sitting at my desk. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-04-25 15:14:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Back story:  Husband and I make decent money, enough to handle a car note.  So I decided last July to trade in my 2003 Corolla and buy a brand new 2013 Prius C for $25k when I still have $30k in student loans to pay off.  

Come February and... surprise! I'm pregnant.  My husband and I want to pay off our debt and buy a house.  I figure one of the quicker ways to do this is to trade in my car and get something older.  

Still owe $21k on the car, trade in value research shows anywhere from 14k - 19k.  I financed through the dealer who then sold my loan to Fifth Third Bank, which doesn't operate in Texas (where I am).

I have no idea what I'm doing.  I don't even know if it's worth it to trade in for an $8-10k car just to still have to pay on my original car loan.   


Edit: thanks for your input! I will be keeping the car, especially since the fuel savings partly make up for the car note. The payment isn't destroying us at all, we still make enough to build up an emergency fund and pay off our debt faster than paying the minimum.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> HELP!!!

I have PCOS with insulin resistance.  Before getting pregnant I was doing the keto diet, but now I can't keep anything down but carbs.  I'm bloating like crazy, already gained 12-15 pounds (depending on the day).  My GP and OB are both telling me to take it easy with the carbs, but I can't keep anything else down.  Eating mainly protein and fats make me really queasy and I eventually throw up everything.  I've been surviving on cereal, sandwiches, fruit, and crackers but I can't stop gaining weight.  

I'm well aware I'm probably eating too many calories, but with the IR carbs make me hungry....

Anyone have any suggestions?  I've tried nuts, eggs, salads, etc...  I just can't seem to stop eating, and it's all carbs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Low progesterone at 11 weeks. Terrified </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-17 15:25:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been seeing an RE since I found out I was pregnant.  At around 6 weeks my progesterone levels were 10-13 so I was put on supplementation just to make sure.  Since then, everything has looked great.  Ultrasounds look textbook, HCG rising perfectly, Estradiol in the right levels.

I was taken off my progesterone supplements last week at 10 weeks (when my levels were 26).  I was told the placenta should start taking over the production.

Went back in yesterday (at 11+3) and my levels were at a 10.1.  I'm terrified.  What if my placenta doesn't take over production enough?

And what's worse is I'm now in a phase where I'm not being overseen by any doctor.  Yesterday was my last day with the RE and I don't see my OB until Tuesday.  So I guess I'll be freaking out until Tuesday.

Any words of advice/encouragement?  I know that 10.1 is technically in the OK range for first trimester, but with the second trimester so close I'm worried I won't be up to 20 by then.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just need to get this off my chest because I can't stop crying.

I almost hit a family today with my car, pregnant mother included.  I was waiting to back out, letting cars pass me in my tiny Prius C, struggling to look around the big truck parked next to me.  Finally a break in the cars passing, so I start to back out slowly.  Then I see a woman to my right looking terrified, so I stop and look around me and I see a man yelling at me.  I shrug, say "I'm so sorry!", look around me once more and keep backing up.  More yelling as I see a 30 week pregnant woman rushing to walk out of the way as I start to back out again.  Turns out she was in my huuuge blind spot (the corner of my car).  I start crying, yell "I'm so sorry" and finally back out and drive away.

Now I can't stop crying.  I can't be for sure I didn't tap someone with my car because I didn't get out and ask like I should have.  I'm trying to reassure myself that there wasn't frantic screaming as I was trying to pull away, just me getting the finger from the man and yelled at.  I also didn't feel anything as I was backing out.

Now I'm going to live in constant fear for the upcoming weeks that the police are going to show up at my door and haul me away.

Fuck my car's blind spot, fuck my apparently not thorough checking all my mirrors and windows.  At least for once I'm not trying to blame the family, though it did cross my mind for a second.

**EDIT** Thank you all SO MUCH.  I feel so much better.  Went and got my hair cut and have completely calmed down.  DH is even taking me out to dinner to help me feel better too.  Thanks for your kind words and support :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm almost 11 weeks and even though I've seen the ultrasounds and my baby is healthy and growing, I don't feel any emotions. 

Husband is freaking out. Asks me "how does it not freak you out that you're growing a human in there??" It just doesn't. I've been hormonal and nauseated, but I don't feel like I've had that "aha" happy moment. 

Maybe when I find out the sex I will feel something? Anyone else have this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So today I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks 1 day.  I've been getting them every week since I'm currently seeing a reproductive endocrinologist.  I went in today and saw the heartbeat!  I also got some blood taken and this is where my question comes from:

Two weeks ago I started Endometrin 100mg once daily.  My levels were at a 13.5 at last week's test.  Then I was upped to 100mg three times daily and I got my blood test back today and my levels went DOWN to 11.5!  I'm freaking out! My doctor hasn't called me yet but I'm so worried.

Anyone been in a similar situation? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just need a place to vent:

I'm 5+4 today. My Endometrin dose got bumped to 3x daily.  Today was the first day I took 3 doses and I am so hormonal. I got chewed out for making a mistake on one of my 1000 tasks at work because my boss doesn't know how to listen despite my telling him I can't handle the workload. I broke down in front of him, and he's the kind of boss that sees it as weakness and doesn't care about the reasoning behind mistakes. He just wants a "I made a mistake and it won't happen again", and will flat out say he doesn't care about why it happened. 

Then I come home and I'm enjoying a nice evening with my tree-smoking husband. We eat dinner, watch tv, talk a little. About 90 minutes ago he left momentarily. I found out it was to eat an edible and 45 min later he is a different person. I don't mind the occasional bowl, but I hate when he eats them. He won't accept my thoughts that it makes him even more forgetful and ridiculous. He says he's the same as when he smokes, which he isn't. 


So now I'm laying in bed crying while he cooks and stinks up the house to satiate his stupid munchies. I'm pretty sure I've cried for a total of 4 hours today. 

So that's it. Fuck hormones. I'm popping a Benadryl and going to sleep. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi /r/babybumps!  I got the confirmation yesterday that I am pregnant for the first time ever at 4 weeks exactly!  I was due to start Femera and trigger shot at the start of my next cycle but it never came :D

I have PCOS so I'm cautiously optimistic, though my hormone levels are very well managed with diet and Metformin.  I've been put on Endometrin (progesterone suppository) and Estradiol (estrogen supplement) to make sure everything progresses well in the first trimester.

I just can't let myself be fully happy about this, though.  No matter if it's a pregnancy or something else, I can never let myself get my hopes up.  I'm afraid if I do, they will be dashed and everything will go wrong.

But for now I'm cautiously optimistic and happy.  Due around November 2!  Only told immediate family, best friends, work HR, and YOU.  

More bloodwork tomorrow to see if the supplements are doing what they need to be doing, then an ultrasound next week!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been getting suuuper faint positives for the last few days. Got blood test done yesterday and my levels are:

Hcg: 9.11

Estradiol: 90.5


Comparing these to the levels in September (1.5 years off bc)

Hcg: 1.00
Prog: 0.516
Estradiol: 20

Going in for a retest on Monday! I'm nervous about CP or MC since I have PCOS, but my doc said my hormone levels are good and stable, nothing is way off thanks to keto and metformin.

<TEXT> DH and I are 26.

We have been off birth control since May 2012.  We've had all the tests done.  I have PCOS and hypothyroidism but have regular cycles. Doctor says I'm probably just not ovulating.

After getting all the necessary tests done, I met with my reproductive endocrinologist and he suggested Femera with an injection to force ovulation since my numbers look good. He doesn't want to risk Clomid giving me a Kate Gosselin-like situation.

A little disappointed with the price for ultrasounds/labs for my Femera + injection cycle.  We have the money, but we are saving for a house and the payment would set us back almost a month in savings.

I took OPKs this month and they were positive. Hopefully I'm pregnant now, I'm 10DPO and took a test this afternoon.  Faintest line, can't tell if it's an evap line or not.  I drink a shit ton of water so I figure unless it's the first pee of the day, I won't be getting an accurate result.  Bought a FRER for the day AF is due and ClearBlue Digital for a day or two after that.  Dollar store tests until then, because I'm an obsessive tester.

Thanks for reading! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I left the precise numbers at work since I talked to a broker at lunch, but I remember the general gist.  Also, I've read PF's opinion on FHA loans, but bear with me here.

Husband and I are currently spending $1125/month on rent.  We know how much expense goes into buying a house after talking to multiple homeowner family members, but we just have dreams of owning a house and being able to save a little bit more money.  We were originally thinking of a single family home, but after finding out the information below, have been considering a townhome.

We were told that for a $120,000 house in our area, our entire monthly payment will be $1114 at 4.75% interest (a slightly high estimate). 

$600+ for principal and interest

$250+ for taxes (not sure what taxes these are)

$120+ for PMI

$100+ for HOI.

I just wanted to know if this VERY ROUGH estimate is accurate for a FHA loan at 3.5% down payment.  Granted we will most likely be going for a 7.5% down payment in a conventional loan, but my husband's frustrated because he seems to have been wrongly estimating for the last year or so of dreaming of home-owning. </TEXT>

SW: 229 CW: 216 GW: 155

I got really discouraged last night because the scale has only moved 13 lbs in the last 2.5 months, so I took another progress picture and compared from my first week. I chalked my lack of scale progress to my PCOS and hypothyroidism (both medicated), but seeing the small changes I've made makes me want to keep going!
Down 1.5 sizes in the pants, shirts are getting a little looser.  Lifting progress is slow, but what I see is a pretty big difference!

Don't be discouraged!

Lifting schedule is:

Monday/Thursday: Upper Body

Tuesday/Friday: Lower Body

Upper Body: Bench, tricep pushdown with rope attachment, face pulls with rope (not sure of technical name for this), bicep curls, shoulder press, lat pulldown

Lower body: Leg press, squats, deadlifts, calf raises, lunges, adduction machine, abduction machine

Wednesday and the weekends are rest or cardio days depending on how I feel.  Eating around 1800 calories/day, never going over 24 g carbs. </TEXT>

I usually run around my apartment complex, that way if I start to have a panic attack I can just go back upstairs and relax.  But I've got a race coming up on Thanksgiving.  

I'm well aware that exercise releases endorphins and can make it better, which it seems to about half the time.  I've gotten through all my runs except one without an incident.  

I'd just like to hear experiences  of others with anxiety on this program and with their 5k.  I'm running with a friend and her mom, but they're both faster than I am.  I'm slow as molasses so I'll most likely be alone for the race. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My husband came up with this to satisfy a craving earlier this week.  I was planning on making keto pumpkin pie, so we had a can of pureed pumpkin. This is what he did:

**Ingredients**

1/2 cup pureed pumpkin

.5 tbsp pumpkin pie spice

1-2 packets splenda

Whipped Cream

**Instructions**

Mix the first 3 ingredients. Taste to see if it's sweet/spiced enough.  Nuke in the microwave for 30 seconds - 1 minute (optional).  Top with some whipped cream.  EAT.

It's super low calorie, *maybe* clocking in at 100 calories if you use canned whipped cream. You'll get a bit of the raw pumpkin twang that you lose when baking a pumpkin pie, but i find it's easy to ignore.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Rant] Appetite is still ravenous </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-17 21:28:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I search "appetite" in /r/keto and all I get is everyone barely able to meet their calorie goals because their appetite is gone.

I have PCOS, which my doctor tells me really sucks for appetite as it's usually more active in ladies with PCOS than those without.  My doctor also fully supports my journey with keto.

Mine's as ravenous as ever.  And keto foods are so calorie dense.  I've tried all the tricks: green tea, water, loads of greens, coconut oil, etc...  I don't have cravings, though, I just am always hungry. I'm also tired all the time.  

Right now I'm trying eat around 1400 calories/day, but frequently go up to 1800 or 2000.  Maybe 2 hours of working out every week, a mix of strength and walking on an incline. My usual day of meals is as follows:

*Breakfast*: almonds and string cheese (about 400 calories worth)

*Lunch*: Greek salad with EVOO and red wine vinegar + gyro meat or chicken

*Dinner*: 80/20 beef with vegetables (either as a taco salad or with cauliflower).

*Snacks*: Handful of almonds, spoonful of almond butter,  pan fried queso blanco, a few strawberries


I usually hit my macros pretty close (even accounting for the increased calories).  I'm not losing weight.  Lost the initial water weight, but nothing else, which I am attributing to my going above the calories I should have. 

Note: PCOS is linked to lowered BMR.  My doctor told me BMR calculators probably won't be accurate for me and that I should have an RMR test done.  This will happen as soon as I save up the money for one. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Introduction: Been on keto this time around for about 3 weeks.  Lost 7 pounds in the first week, stalled between 221.8 and 220 for the last 2 weeks.  Minimal exercise (maybe 1-2 hours/week), trying to stay under 1600 calories/day but usually going up to 1900-2000. Do IF 4 days/week, with 16 off/8 on. Measurements have been a consistent 38-35-46 since week 2.  Have PCOS with IR and am on 1000mg Metformin/day (recently reduced from 2000mg by Doctor's suggestion).  Doctor suggested keto for weight loss, plus I find it easy not to eat carbs. Tracking food religiously on MFP.  

**Keto foods are so fucking calorie dense** and I hate 85% of vegetables!  I will eat cauliflower and cabbage until I'm stuffed, but that's honestly up until the carb counts of the vegetables start to get high (2.5 cups of cauliflower is about 7g net carbs according to MFP).

I'm not going to give up, because I want to be healthy (not just skinny) and get pregnant.  But I just wanted to rant about how I never feel full unless I go over my calories!  

Currently cutting back on diet soda, hoping that will help. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question] How can I get more clean protein? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-03 01:45:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Stats: 25/f/223lbs.  Exercise: 25 minutes cardio (interval running) + machine weights MWF.  Goal: get fitter and slowly (but eventually) get to 160lbs.

My diet isn't 100% clean, but it's definitely mostly clean.  I'm also the pickiest eater imaginable, and I don't think a diet has to be full of foods I detest.  I hate eggs, but I eat them in the morning with salsa because it masks the taste.  I hate beans, and I hate most nuts (but not nut butters).  I'm having a hard time topping 100g of protein per day.  I know I should eventually have around 120g, but I'm just working on 100g right now.  

I love fruit.  If I have 2 pieces of whole wheat bread/day and a few pieces of fruit I don't have cravings for anything worse.  I measure everything religiously.  I just refuse to go over 1600 calories/day.  I'm not lifting heavy since I'm just starting out.  I'm getting the "going to the gym" routine set first because if I shove myself in the deep end I'll get discouraged and give up (as I have so many times before).

**Am I going to just need to eat less fruit and more meat?**

Typical day of eating:

Breakfast:
 
* 2 eggs with a little cheese, 2 slices of bacon, salsa, and lots of vegetables (2 egg muffin cups), 2 clementine oranges

Lunch:

* turkey sandwich (whole wheat bread) with homemade oven roasted turkey (4 oz), kale chips, 8 medium strawberries

Dinner:

* Either burger patty from 1/2lb raw 80/20 beef, 1.5 salmon burger patty (from seafood counter), 4 oz chicken, with some non-starchy vegetable

Snacks:

* 2-3 of the following per day: apple with (pure) almond butter, grapes, a little turkey, 2 clementines, kale chips


TL;DR: Not eating enough protein.  Without nuts and beans, how can I get more clean protein in?  Just eat less fruit and more meat?

I haven't run in probably 18 months.  In those 18 months I have started and quelled a battle with anxiety.  I've been on Celexa for 8 months now, and have not tried to run in those 8 months... until yesterday.

A little background: husband and I started eating healthy, tracking food, and working out one week ago today.  We both have confidence we are going to make it this time, and are taking it slowly, one day at a time.

Yesterday was my leg day.  I did my regular leg routine and just planned on walking with my husband on the treadmills for 30 minutes.  I got bored after about 2 minutes of walking and decided to try a light jog, hesitant that my HR would shoot up and I wouldn't be able to breathe very well.

Quite the contrary! My HR was at a max of 167, and I did intervals of running (90 seconds on, 2 minutes off).

I wanted to cry.  I'm now convinced I am able to run and will eventually be able to run a mile for the first time in my life.   When that day comes I will be bawling in the middle of my gym.

I feel like we're really going to make it this time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is for my husband. He's a pretty big guy, and we have been eating healthy, tracking cops, and going to the gym every day this week. Since starting, he has put on 10 lbs. I wouldn't believe it myself if I didn't see it.

The second day we worked out he hurt his elbow (tennis elbow) and I know muscle healing can cause water retention. But really? Ten pounds worth? 

I'm taking him to a doctor asap to get bloodwork done and make sure this regimen is ok for him, but due to work schedules this could take up to 6 weeks. 

Any advice? He's just a little discouraged. 

Typical workout week:
Monday: walking 30 mins + arms
Tuesday: walking + legs
Wednesday: walking
Thursday: walking + legs
Friday: walking + arms

Abs are done every day except Wednesday. </TEXT>

I don't want to nix squats completely until my strength improves for me to be able to get to parallel.  I've read some places that doing kettlebell squats can help.  I just did no-weight squats facing the wall to make sure my form is correct.

Has anyone else been in this situation before?  Any suggestions on how to proceed from here?  I plan on continuing the SS workout, just supplementing barbell squats with kettlebell or something similar until the form is right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a dieting guru.  I've tried it all, failed at it all, and now I'm extremely discouraged. 

I just finished day 5 of whole30, where basically for 30 days you don't put anything artificial in your body.  It's paleo, but doesn't allow for paleo hacks either (like paleo desserts), and no artificial sweeteners, limited fruit intake, no dairy or legumes, etc....  I'm so pissed off today.  I hate greens, I hate vegetables, I don't think this is ever going to work for me.

I've had food issues since I was young.  When I was 3 my parents found me eating Oreos in the pantry after they were fighting.  I have half a thyroid, PCOS, and had my gallbladder out in January.  Since the surgery I have gained 30 lbs.  Those of you who know anything about hypothyroidism and PCOS, losing weight is extremely difficult.  

I have tried every diet you can think of that doesn't involve food delivery.  Weight watchers, keto, Atkins, low fat high carb, and now paleo.  I'm sick of being disgusted with my body, but I'm also sick of the dieting mentality I'm stuck with.  I even tried giving up the diet mentality in April but ended up gaining 10 lbs because I didn't deny myself anything.

I'm at my wits end.  The only time I have ever had success in weight loss was when I wasn't even trying.  I would eat a #1 from McDonald's every morning, walk a mile on campus to get to my classes, then eat a McDonald's cheeseburger (the tiny ones) for dinner.  I never denied myself anything, but I was on Zoloft, which killed my appetite.  I would go out to eat and have two bites and be "full" (nauseated).  I dropped 50 lbs in 8 months doing this.  Only downside is that while the Zoloft killed my appetite, it killed my personality and sex drive, too.

I'm currently in counseling and have discussed my issues with food, but simply depriving myself of things leads to me bingeing later, even if I try to acknowledge and think through the feelings I'm having.  I've tried CBT, I'm on anti-depressants still (Celexa), along with medicine for PCOS and hypothyroidism.

I don't know why I'm putting this here. I don't know what I need from you, /r/loseit.  I just know that I had to tell someone my feelings. Maybe I've convinced myself I'm never going to lose the weight, never going to get pregnant, and live a miserable life because of it.  When I was at 170lbs in 2010, I was the most content I've ever been in my life despite having zero personality.  I loved my body and had confidence.  

TL;DR: I've tried everything and am close to giving up.  I don't know what to do.


Edit: Thanks for all the encouragement and advice.  If you want to add me on MFP my username is lefoll.  I have taken what everyone has said to heart and am not going to give up.  I may not stay on the whole30 wagon for much longer, but I'll be making wiser choices and I'm going for a walk (at least) tonight. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Obese female starting strength training on Friday. What's the best way to go? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-03 19:45:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've read /r/fitness 's FAQ, I've read multiple articles on strength training, from both bodybuildling.com and other sites.  I get the basic breakdown:

Powerlifting: low reps/high weight
Bodybuilding: mid reps/mid-high weight
stabilizing: high reps/low-mid weight

I'm obese (5'5", 25yo, 225lbs) and cardio has never been good for me.  I'm an absolute beginner.  I've read things on 5x5, I've read starting strength, etc... but I'm still clueless.  I had a trainer last year who worked me out on the cable machines, but in all honesty I'd rather work with dumbbells/barbells. 

I plan on watching lots of videos before I join the Y on Friday (payday).  Any other suggestions?  I'm currently eating 90% paleo (2 meals/week where I don't eat paleo, and even then I don't eat rice/pasta/bread).   </TEXT>

<TITLE> On Metformin... again. Anyone successfully lose weight/conceive with Metformin without keto? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-15 15:56:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2006 at the age of 18.  Since then I've been off and on Metformin 4 different times.  As soon as I get up to 1500mg/day, my stomach just rebels.  It's horrible. I get pale, cold sweats, and have to be near a bathroom at all times.

In 2011 I lost 50 pounds but have gained all of it back.  My doctor suggested trying Metformin ER again, since I'm eating healthy and working out to no avail. For the last 12 months I have been attempting to eat very low carb but fail at every turn. Now I'm just eating lots of  vegetables and meats with fruit for dessert.    

My husband and I have been (casually) TTC for the last 12 months with nothing.  I have a period every month, but my insurance doesn't cover any fertility specialists so I can't get additional testing done at this time.

I'm currently on 1000mg/day but the dosage may go up in the future.  If I do go up, should I fight through the symptoms? Do they get any better over time? 

I'm not on anything else, no Spiro or BC.  

Any opinions on this? Any successful weight loss stories with Metformin?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My husband and I have been discussing this as we've been watching through all the seasons lately.

The set and character's outfits make it seem like the show takes place earlier, but there are pop culture references and modern tech.  

Some more things that lead us to believe it takes place earlier is that all the veterans have fought in WWI, not WWII, and the KGB still exists.  The KGB was dissolved in 1991.

Archer's Dodge Challenger looks like the old Challengers, regardless of new tech.

Guns are also very accurately portrayed, there doesn't seem to have been a modern gun.  There was one Barrett M82 and a TEC-9, both of which were produced in the 1980's.

We always look really deep into these things.  I mean, it's a fictional universe, yes, so this is pretty much ridiculous. </TEXT>

Before starting treatment in October I had missed work because I couldn't get myself out of bed, usually a day a week.  My boss has been great up until now about it, not requiring any "excuses" and letting me work from home.

Now I have gallbladder disease which has led me to multiple ER visits and a surgery that's coming up soon.  I'm just afraid that this will be the last straw and I'll end up jobless.  I really love this job and am working my butt off from home when I do stay home.

Any advice? Maybe it's my anxiety getting to me, or maybe my fears are legitimate.  I guess fear of the unknown is a big thing for me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Rant] So absolutely livid, never left work because of a panic attack before. Possible trigger warning? Wall of text? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-07 21:24:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My newly prescribed Klonopin to help my anxiety until my Celexa saturates in my system has been working pretty well, until this morning.

Never in my life have I had to leave work because of anxiety.  My main trigger is my heart rate and the thought of dying alone.  

So last night I ate way too much, which happens about once a month.  I was up with stomach pain, puking, and general discomfort for 3 hours.  So I called into work saying I'd be late, no big deal.  I take my medicine before I leave for work (2 hours late) but I can already tell it's going to be a bad day.

On my way to work I can't stop checking my pulse.  It's fast.  I get to work, sit down, drink water, and it's still fast.  I do my breathing exercises, I try to distract myself with work and it's still at least 120bpm.  This just keeps the negative feedback loop going on in my brain.  So I call my husband, because he can help calm me down sometimes.  I do everything I've been taught to do and nothing is helping. I decide Klonopin hasn't started working yet so I try to wait it out for 2 hours while having a panic attack.

No dice.

My boss is out of the office basically 10 minutes after I get there so I jot him an email saying for personal reasons I have to leave for the day.  I tell my coworker I can work from home if anything needs to be done and I pack up my shit and head out the door.  

My heart is still up to around 105bpm, which is better, but still not ideal.  My brain has stopped working that stupid loop it does so well.  I think my Klonopin is working now.  I've just resigned myself to the fact that all that discomfort from last night has my HR up.  No chest pains, no shortness of breath, and my doctor says to just wait a couple days and if it's not back down to come in.


I FUCKING HATE THIS.  I shouldn't be in danger of losing my job but the doubt in my mind is always going.  Yesterday was perfect.  So perfect.  No anxiety, lots of fun, no worries.  Then fucking bam... today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This includes withdrawals from pills.

I took 200mg of Zoloft for depression 2 years ago and it eliminated my personality and my appetite.  I lost 50lbs on it (which was good, I was at 220) but I was a shell of my former self.  The withdrawal was nothing like what others have experienced. No brain zaps, no shakes or sweats, no vomiting, nothing.  It was just normal for me.  

I tried Zoloft again recently for my general anxiety at a lower dosage (started at 25mg and upped to 50mg) but it actually made my anxiety worse this time around so I just stopped taking it.  I'm going back for a reevaluation tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Background info: We are newlyweds (8 months) and bring home about $52k after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc... We have $30k in debt.  We have only my 401k which just kicked in last month. We rent an apartment and are moving to a less-expensive one in March when our current lease is up.  We own our cars outright, and as of right now my student loans qualify for income based repayment.  The minimum payment required per month is $0, since we file taxes separately. 

We have no savings. We spend frivolously, convincing ourselves we'll be fine and we have the money to buy ____. Truth be told, if we have any sort of financial crisis my in-laws would probably help us out, but I don't want to get to that point. 

I'm considering attending Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University in January because I'm so desperate to have an emergency fund and save up for a down payment and other things.  

Our biggest struggle is that our rent eats up the first paycheck of the month and then some. We live in a city where the cost of living is pretty low for the US, so finding that cheaper apartment isn't difficult.  

I'm curious if any resources really worked for you, or any advice you have for us.  Did anyone try FPU? I'm aware that FPU is biblical, but I'm more concerned with the results than anything else.  Not to mention my husband and I are (somewhat lapsed) Christians

<TEXT> I've been attempting keto for the last 6 months but can't really get the hang of it.  I have metabolic syndrome and a voracious appetite, so eating what I want on keto hasn't been beneficial with the calorie-dense foods.  

Today I started eating every 2.5-3 hours, having no more than 200 calories.  This has satisfied my desire to eat all the time, as well as helped me stay under my 1300 calorie limit.

Anyone else have to do this or something similar in order to keep on track?  

I've heard for the last 6 months that my appetite will go away, just wait it out.  Never happened.  I'm not willing to wait anymore, because I've gone 6 months without losing a single pound.  Granted, I haven't gained any weight, but going to the gym 3x a week and working out with a personal trainer once a week... I'm not happy at all. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help on finding a church </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-13 17:56:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so basically since I went to college in 2006 I haven't been extremely involved in churches.  I would go about once a month.  Since I got married 7 months ago my husband and I have been once.  I want to be involved in a church but both my husband and I have a hard time being involved in a church whose services we really don't enjoy whatsoever or a church we disagree with on our big points.

We talked about this last night and my husband describes himself as a lapsed Christian.  He believes what Christianity teaches overall, but he can't find a church that meets his needs.  

First of all, we're in Texas.  Lots of churches I've been to here are preaching that homosexuality is horrific and anyone not heterosexual is essentially going to hell.  We don't share that belief at all.  

Second, the whole evolution thing.  We are *not* YEC's, and we'd like to find a church that embraces science and evolution instead of being apathetic or strongly YEC. 

Third, the layout.  We're so over singing 3 songs and hearing a preacher tell us stories from his personal life that somehow connect to the message of "Jesus saves" that he's preaching. My husband really enjoys the liturgical side of worship even more than the message itself.

Basically my husband and I want a place where we can get into the Greek and Hebrew of the message, getting more into the context of the passages and knowing what was really going on at the time and what it really means.

We believe the Bible in its original languages is infallible. We are neither Calvinist nor Arminian, we are Lutheran in that sense, but we don't need a Lutheran church.  We just don't want someone that will shove either Cism or Aism down our throats because we don't find that important whatsoever.

I've looked into home churches in my area and I found one and have messaged the pastor about these issues, but I'm willing to bet that his answer will not be what I'm looking for.

Any suggestions?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In late march I had a debilitating panic attack.  I was dizzy, heart rate was up, I was pacing for 3 hours straight.  I went to the ER and got diagnosed with an inner ear infection.  Vertigo along with anxiety are very common symptoms of this infection, so I kept having mini panic attacks due to my loss of equilibrium.  

I went back on 12.5 mg of Zoloft, as I had been off it for 3 months when the attack hit.  Ever since then I've had GAD, being on the brink of an attack all day, every day.

Recently I started working out and went off the Zoloft and lo and behold, no more anxiety at all.  It cooled down to about 85 the other day (for Houston that's a nice day) and I closed my eyes walking outside and felt genuinely happy for the first time in over 2 years.  

Pretty sure the Zoloft and sedentary lifestyle was causing my constant anxiety.

I just wanted to celebrate this on this subreddit, which has been helpful in these past 6 months dealing with this shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back story:  I was on 200mg of Zoloft (for depression mostly) for 18 months and weaned myself off under a doctor's supervision, as I was a zombie and it was driving my then-fiance away. I had some major panic attacks for the  first time in my life starting in March of this year.  For about 2 months I was having them 3 times a week.  Then they waned down some to only once or twice a month, after going back on ~12.5mg of Zoloft again.  I think this was a mistake, as I wasn't under a doctor's supervision because I didn't have insurance at all. 

Today was one of those times where I had a panic attack for a good 3 hours. Even the calming manatee didn't help. I think I may have unevenly broke my pill last night and took too much, but I just felt extremely lightheaded, my vision was all fucked up, and I felt especially disconnected from reality.  My brain was not working right and it freaked me out.  I couldn't think of the words I was trying to say, I wasn't making the connection with words I read in emails and on paper.  It's like, I knew the words but the information wasn't making it to my brain. The disconnect is what gets me the most.  I don't feel like myself anymore.  I feel disconnected for the majority of my day and I feel on edge all the fucking time. After today, I've now got an enormous headache, probably because my brain was working overtime today.

So today I made an appointment with a psychiatrist for the first time.  My old GP originally prescribed me Zoloft but now I've had enough.  I need an adjustment.  I need to feel normal again.  I just don't want to keep feeling like I'm going down the rabbit hole into insanity anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> F, 25 yo, 5'5", 193lbs.  

I just started CrossFit yesterday.  I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it, even though I felt like I was going to die towards the end.  The workout was scaled down.  I was reminded, however, why I've not stuck with working out before.

About 5 minutes into any vigorous workout, my chest starts burning.  My heart rate is pretty elevated but my doctor says it's nothing to be worried about (175 max).  I've breathed through my nose, through my mouth, breathed deeper, but nothing seems to alleviate this.  

This is ultimately what stopped my previous work out attempts.  About 2 years ago I got to week 3 of C25K but couldn't progress farther, despite doing week 3 for 2 months straight.  The chest burning was too much. I noticed last night a bit of wheezing for about 30 minutes after the workout was completed.

Could this be athletic asthma?  Or am I just a wuss and need to push through it? I plan on visiting a GP in the next couple weeks, but I wanted to hear some opinions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Currently seeing a counselor, need to adjust my meds and don't want to go to a psychiatrist. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title says it all.  I had a GP since birth who I recently left because he started charging a monthly fee.  Long story, but when I was with him I expressed an interest in seeing a psychiatrist.  He told me not to, because of certain tactics psychiatrists use vs. counselors.  He didn't want someone trying to get me on a cocktail of medications when I really only needed one and some good CBT.

So now I'm running out of Zoloft and I need to get my dose readjusted.  Do I go see another GP and tell him/her my situation and ask for a reassessment of my medications?  I'm on 25mg of Zoloft.  Without my meds I'm irritable, on edge, and anxious.  If I break my 50mg pill unevenly and take more than half I'm anxious, lightheaded, and can't stop zoning out.

I know y'all aren't doctors and I need to see one, but I just need some form of feedback so I'll know what to expect. </TEXT>

On that same topic, I know I should ask a doctor the following question, but I'm working on getting short term health insurance at the moment.  Because my periods aren't irregular, does that mean I'm fertile? I figure me getting a period every 30 days or so means I'm ovulating once in that time period.

<TITLE> Ladies with PCOS, any success? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, I started keto April 15.  I've had PCOS for about 6-7 years but haven't taken my medication.  Recently I fell off the wagon after having absolutely no success on keto and actually having it exacerbate my anxiety.  I've been eating still lower carb than before keto, but only because carbs have started to frighten me.  I had one bout of a high-carb meal and felt extremely hyperglycemic. 

Anyways, basically what happened through my 75 days of keto was I lost the initial water weight the first 2 weeks.  After that I had nothing.  I was fluctuating around the same weight (193 lbs) the entire time, no matter what I did.  I went to /r/keto for help multiple times, resulting in me trying IF, fat fasting, water increase, weight training, everything.  Nothing was working.

So when I fell off the wagon I decided to start taking my Metformin again.  It hasn't caused the digestive issues it had before, thankfully, but I need some motivation.  I need some inspiration.  

TL;DR: Keto didn't work for me the first time for 75 days when I was unmedicated.  Now I'm back on medicine but I need to hear some stories from ladies with PCOS who have had success using keto and Metformin to lose weight. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sorry, keto, I have to up my carb intake for my own mental health.  I'll treasure the knowledge you gave me.  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-04 16:03:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One would think I'm wired perfectly for keto.  I have PCOS, I'm insulin resistant, and I'm chubby.  Nothing else has ever worked before.

So here's my story.

As per my stats in my flair, I started 4/15.  First week, lost 12 pounds of what I'm assuming was mostly water weight.  After the first week, nothing. I tried IF, fat fasting, cutting artificial sweeteners, upping protein, upping fat, weight training, light cardio... you name it, I tried it.  I was drowning myself in water every day.  

Then, about 10 days in my brain became foggy.  Researched it on here, upped my potassium via V8 low sodium, lite salt, swiss chard, cream of tartar, and avocados.  Met all my electrolyte goals on MFP but my perception was still off.  

Then it happened.

This change in perception, along with the dizziness and light-headedness, caused my anxiety to skyrocket.  I've never had full-blown panic attacks until the beginning of May, when I started having them almost every other day.  I went to urgent care walk-in clinics twice, got put on beta blockers, but I still *felt* wrong.  I saw the world differently than I had before.  Even my regular GP couldn't give me an answer as to why I was feeling like I was, so I made an appointment with a therapist.  

Friday, June 1, after feeling utterly miserable anxiety-wise for the last 40 days or so (the requisite amount of time it takes the brain to adjust to ketones), my husband took me on a date. Long story short, I cheated and had about 40g net carbs.  Figured I'd wake up the next day out of ketosis and feeling miserable.

I woke up the next morning, sure enough, out of ketosis.  But there was something different.  **I felt normal** and I was perceiving the world like I used to, no more dizziness or lightheadedness, no more postural hypotension.  So I went on the internet and realized that in some people with serotonin deficiencies, keto can exacerbate anxiety like nobody's business.  This increase in anxiety was causing me to stress out, which is why (I assume) I wasn't losing any weight at all.

So I'm sorry keto.  For my own mental health I can't continue this.  Don't worry, I'm not going low-fat diet or anything, I think I'll just try paleo for a while.  You know, adding in vegetables with a higher net carb count, maybe increasing my carb macro to 15% while increasing my cardio a little.  I'll still hang around here for food inspiration.

*I'm just not willing to sacrifice my sanity for 20g carbs per day. I'm now just sticking with under 50g.  Some might still consider this keto, some may not.*


**TL;DR: After 7 weeks of keto, my anxiety had skyrocketed, I was foggy, and I wasn't losing weight, despite my efforts to change all of these through advice sought on /r/keto.  Had a minor cheat Friday and felt normal for the first time in 6 weeks, researched, and realized those with serotonin deficiency can have anxiety exacerbated through extremely low-carb diets.  Upping my carb count to 50g and wanted to post this in case someone in the future has a similar problem.**



Edit: **I just wanted to share this in case anyone ever goes through it as well, they can see what happened to another person.** I'm not saying keto is unhealthy (quite the contrary), I'm just saying it doesn't *always* make anxiety and depression better, and it *can* have some adverse side effects depending on your body chemistry and the medications you're taking.  


Thank you so much for the kind words and encouragement.  I love /r/keto </TEXT>

<TITLE> Church work without the politics? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all, long time no talk.  Sorry I haven't been as active here as I used to be, but life caught up with me.  

Anyways, I have a question and am not good at brainstorming these things on my own.

My husband has felt the calling to work in a ministry of some form since shortly after he became a Christian.  Recently, however, he's become very disillusioned to working in an actual church due to the politics that go on.  He doesn't want to deal with the bigotry of individual people, the limitations of what he can speak about so that he doesn't upset some people, the emails after a sermon from some upset congregation member, the list goes on.  This can extend to foreign missions, too, but he's been pretty clear that with the gifts God gave him, he's pretty sure the call isn't for foreign missions anyways.

What are some other roles that don't require specific denominational affiliation, don't require answering to hundreds of people, yet still allow him to get his M.Div and spread the love of Christ through his actions and responsibilities?

The only thing I could come up with is a chaplain for a hospital, which he expressed some interest in.  I just thought I'd get some feedback from you guys and gals since our brainstorming sessions have ended up empty.

Note: while we're trying to volunteer our time through our church and other things, this needs to be a paid position, one that pays enough to contribute enough to raise a family on (along with mine).  We don't expect it to pay a lot, but we're hoping more than the $23k/year youth ministry positions we're finding in the ELCA and LCMS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been on keto for 5 weeks now and, following the initial water weight, have not lost another pound. I'm consistently under 20g carbs, am drinking enough water, am meeting my macros and calorie goals, have tried IF, fat fasting, and cutting out artificial sweeteners. 

I've measured myself and haven't lost any inches. I'm literally the same place I was after losing the water weight. If I had lost the 10 pounds spread out over 5 weeks this post wouldn't be here. 

The only way I'm not perfectly meeting my macros is on the net carbs. I'm usually under 20g, around 10 or 15.  I eat spinach salads every day and broccoli at night, so I'm getting enough veggies. I'm on a probiotic and multivitamin. 

What gives? I have insulin resistance and PCOS, so this lifestyle should be perfect for me. My sugar addiction is gone but the weight won't come off at all. 

The only thing I can think of is that I should try the last resort: working out. My nemesis. I've never had good endurance or diligence when it came to working out and I was put on beta blockers this last week so it worries me a bit. 

I just need advice. I've posted my food logs before and adjusted my macros as advised. They're never perfect by someone's standards but they're pretty damn close. 

Help me, /r/keto. You're my only hope  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My husband has a psychological addiction to a pot-like substance.  We got married in March.  I have been asking him to cut back for a long time, for probably 18 months now but my prodding became serious in the past 2 months.  Every time we get into a discussion about it, the topic always turns to why I don't like it, and how my reasons aren't enough to warrant him quitting.  He can see himself doing this for the rest of his life.  He claims if pot were ever legalized, he'd use the real stuff.  He claims to use this fake shit because of work and other legal issues.

He doesn't smoke around me, he's granted me that and I'm grateful for the compromise.  He smokes before work, on his lunch break, and he smokes after I go to bed while he plays video games.  Now, this isn't to say I don't understand, I was the exact same.  I smoked this shit for 2 years before a new blend gave me the worst anxiety attack of my life and I gave it up.  He made a deal with me to only buy a certain amount every week and he's broken that in the past 2 weeks.  He always has excuses ready, like he was sick and it makes him feel better so he smoked a lot one day, a fight we got in stressed him out so he smoked a lot that day too, etc&#8230;

I don't like it because I don't want his life to revolve around this substance.  I also don't want to deal with the financial repercussions if, God forbid, one of us loses our job or something happens.  It's getting to the point where I'm paranoid about him going behind my back and breaking the compromise by getting cash back on debit transactions in order to go buy this stuff without my knowledge, despite his promise to include me on all substance purchases.  The ideal situation would be that a) I just lose all concern about this and b) he stay within the boundaries of our compromise for financial reasons.

He was raised by an unbearably nagging mother, so any time I seriously get in his face about this he just shuts down in order to shut me up.  That's what worked with his mother and it infuriates me.  I don't want to annoy him and be on his case constantly; I don't want to be his mother.

TL;DR: Husband is addicted to pot-like substance, denies its control over his life. I'm getting paranoid and would love any advice to break me out of this paranoia.  To be completely honest I just don't want to care anymore, but I have a history of anxiety and I have a hard time controlling my thoughts.  

Thanks for the advice, everyone.  This post may have come off as a "help me convince my husband to stop or tell me what to do to make it go away." I meant it to be "I know my thoughts are irrational so can someone please give me some advice to deal with this better?" 4nonymo was the most helpful in this.  Many of your points have been brought up in our 5 fights about it and they've all been successfully resolved, but my anxious and nagging feelings remained.  The only course of action left is for me to go get some form of therapy to help deal with my mental health.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 25/f, in case it matters

My anxiety used to be just very occasional, seemingly mild panic attacks. 

Then one day in late March, I took a nap after dinner and woke up to the most horrific panic attack of my life.  It lasted 3 hours, then I finally went to the ER.  They said I might be dehydrated, and then eventually discovered an ear infection.

Apparently the nerve that goes from the inner ear to the brain, the one that causes dizziness with this, also goes to the part that triggers anxiety.  So I had to deal with anxiety and dizziness for the next 10 days or so.

I also started /r/keto around the time my dizziness subsided.

Ever since mid-April I've had this constant mild anxiety, where my resting heart rate is 85-105 bpm.  I have random dizzy spells.  I've been off Zoloft for 7 months and ran out of lorazepam during my ear infection, and I can't get another script for a while due to a medical insurance snafu.  

My anxiety is in the form of hypochondria and doomsday thoughts.  I can't drive on the freeway after work because I'm terrified of an accident.  I'm constantly checking my pulse.  I have anxiety when I wake up from naps, so I don't nap anymore.  It seems that my depression is no longer wreaking havoc over my life, just the anxiety.

It's driving me crazy.  I've tried l-theanine, but I'm afraid to take it too much because of the hypochondria.  I'm picking up magnesium on the way home from work for both anxiety and digestive issues.  

**Could this still be due to the inner ear problem? What should I do? Any luck with OTC supplements??** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've posted a couple links in the past few days that have my daily recordings of food, and a few people said my macros are off and I'm not getting enough protein.

So I went out and bought Jay Robb's chocolate whey protein powder, 1g net carbs per scoop.

Fucking shit kicked me out of ketosis.  

***FOR THE KETO ANALYSTS/EXPERTS:***Does it **really** matter that my macros aren't up to par all the time? I'm getting more fat than anything and staying below my carb ratio.  My protein is about 75% of what it should be, but I'm not getting all the way up there because I get really full really quickly.

I'm just extremely frustrated, because I've been doing everything right and I've been stuck around 193 for the past 2 weeks now.  I'm a woman, my body shouldn't be comfortable at this weight.  Maybe I should take a walk tonight or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [I posted yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/to4ch/first_day_of_tracking_all_of_my_food_would_like/), asking for feedback of my first fully-tracked food day.

I tracked again, and I can't seem to get enough protein.  I ate a mass amount of shrimp for dinner and even then, not enough.  I want to stay away from protein powder, as I have a difficult time drinking disgusting things and I've yet to find one that is tasty.  

If I have to, I'll buy protein powder.  What are some other ways of getting in some more protein?

<TITLE> Anxiety, keto, and 5-HTP </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-05-15 18:50:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had mild depression and anxiety for the past 10 years or so (since my teens).  About 7 months ago I weaned myself off of Zoloft, because I wanted to feel emotions again.  I wasn't very anxious until I had an ear infection recently, which somehow triggered my anxiety.  Now I have a constant mild anxiety regarding my health and safety. 

Anyways, I've read that 5-HTP is a good natural supplement that helps with mild anxiety and depression and was wondering if anyone uses it while doing keto and if there are any adverse side effects?

I have a theory as to why my anxiety has creeped back up and the weight hasn't been coming off easily: serotonin.  I think I'm serotonin deficient and there are studies that show that serotonin deficiency has an adverse effect on weight loss and weight control, and 5-HTP has shown to increase serotonin levels.  I used to get the serotonin from eating carby foods, because I was a sugar addict. I would feel awesome as I was eating sugary, carb-laden foods, but about 10 minutes afterwards would feel physically miserable from hyperglycemia (I've got PCOS and am insulin resistant).  

EDIT:  Thanks to everyone for the advice! I decided to give L-Theanine a go and got a bottle.  I took one about 30 minutes ago (6:25pm CST) and am already feeling **MUCH** more stable, especially given that my hypochondriac anxiety was very mild to begin with </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Rant][NSV] Giving up preconceived notions and curing an addiction. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-05-14 14:55:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's really encouraging to see people losing 20 pounds in the first month.  But it's also frustrating to get through my own first month and only have lost 10 pounds.  I've basically plateaued since after the first week.  I've had a couple of cheat meals (one being yesterday), and it seems like it takes my weight forever to get back on track even though I'm pissing dark pink on the sticks and have smelly breath.

I posted a comment not too long ago about waiting to exercise until I'm down some more weight, but I decided with my current frustration to change my mind.  I'm starting some light weight training tonight with my husband.  I'm giving up most of the artificially sweetened things that were staples of my beginning keto diet.  

I have to remind myself that my progress will probably be slower than others', since in the past 18 months I've lost 50 pounds and gained 30 back.  I know yo-yo dieting has an effect on speed of weight loss, as well as my PCOS (and, therefore, insulin resistance), hypothyroidism, and IBS.  

One thing I will say for certain that I'm very pleased with: my sugar addiction is gone.  It was so bad before I got married and started keto that about twice a month I would have this enormous craving for cookies or cake and go to Wal-Mart to fulfill my desires.  For those of you with insulin resistance and former sugar addiction, you know this craving was basically insatiable.  You'd go, eat half the carton of oreos (or even the whole carton if it was a particularly bad one) and then feel like death was coming afterwards.  Now, I have that deathy feeling even after a small cheat.  I get tired, my eyes go cross, my anxiety creeps back up on me.  It's horrendous.  This morning, for example, I feel like death and an overly inflated balloon.  I had one of my sister's famous brownies yesterday and I felt like hell the rest of the day.  

So even though I'm frustrated at my lack of success, thank you, /r/keto, for curing my addiction. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I&#8217;ve had chronic constipation for as long as I can remember.  It&#8217;s been the black spot on my life that I can&#8217;t seem to get rid of, and now that I&#8217;m doing keto religiously, it&#8217;s gotten worse.  &#8220;Rabbit poops&#8221; are an apt term to describe my predicament up until a few days ago.  I&#8217;ve barely defecated since Sunday, so today after work I&#8217;m going to pick up a glycerin enema.  I eat a carbmaster yogurt every day, so I thought I would be getting all the probiotics I need.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

DISCLAIMER: **Don&#8217;t recommend fiber.**  It just exacerbates the problem by increasing the volume of my fecal matter.  That is, it clogs me even more.  My doctor has said to stay away from psyllium husks, benefiber, and even flaxseed meal because of this in the past.    

**EDIT** Thanks for all the advice!  I"m going to try the coconut oil in coffee in the mornings, but tonight I think I'll use more... uncomfortable and temporary solutions.  I need this out of me because I've gained 3 pounds and am bloated as fuck (*not* from water retention, I can tell)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Background: I live in Houston, big metropolitan area, low cost of living (especially in the &#8216;burbs).  &#8220;Poor&#8221; credit score due to stupidity by my husband and myself with college credit cards, getting it sorted out, though it will take a while.

We currently rent an apartment here, spending about $1300/month on rent + utilities.  Two questions:

1. If we can&#8217;t get approved for credit cards, will we get approved for a mortgage

2. If we could get approved for a mortgage, would we be better off buying a house (probably $125k or less) or should we just stick with an apartment?

Which would be better for us financially (in a broad sense since I&#8217;m not sharing any more financial information), renting or &#8220;owning&#8221;?

<DATE> 2012-04-28 22:54:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I woke up this morning (10am) with a slightly elevated temp (98.9 for someone with unmedicated hypothyroidism due to marginal blood work and maxed out insurance).

30 minutes ago it had skyrocketed to 101.4.  I thought it was just a hangover from the double jack and diet I had last night (first drink since starting keto), but when the fever hit I was convinced it's something else.  I can't keep anything but smart water, vitamins, and aspirin down and I'm having the runs (TMI, sorry).  It's currently a birth-control induced shark week, as that may be important.

I've been in ketosis since 4/17 and have lost 10 pounds.  My husband is out getting me sugar free jello to try to keep down.

My question is this: **What should I do?** Since I'm in ketosis, I'm not retaining water so I'm afraid I'll get dehydrated.  Should I just sacrifice for the sickness and eat some carbs? I'm feeling absolutely miserable and honestly can't afford to visit a doctor other than a free clinic, so I'm coming to the keto experts first.

Again, I apologize for hounding r/keto with questions today (all 2 of them).

EDIT: Thanks for the responses.  I ate some tyson chicken nuggets (5 of them at 15g total) and am waiting for sugar free jell-o to set.  This was a couple hours ago so I feel better now and the sticks are saying I'm still in ketosis.  I'll be drinking the broth. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He's 6'2 and around 360, but he's seen the scale go up 5 pounds in our first week of weighing (3rd week of keto).  He says he's always hungry and is in ketosis all the time (I've seen the stix).  I figured since he's a big guy he doesn't have to watch his calories *that* much, based on what I've read in this subreddit for the past 3 months or so.  He also claims to be tired and hungry all the time.

He drinks about a gallon of water every day, salad for lunch, meats and cheeses and veggies for dinner. Usually skips breakfast bc he doesn't have time as he likes to sleep as late as possible. He has a couple sprite zeroes a night.  Meanwhile I've been losing on the diet faster than I've lost before.

Any advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is for the husband, not me.  

He's a pretty big guy, 6'2 325lbs +.  We started keto last week and he started drinking more water specifically today.  Before today he would mainly stick to diet sodas or flavored sparkling waters ([these](http://www.amazon.com/Sparkling-ICE-Variety-Flavors-17-Ounce/dp/B003OZYVE4)). He said he feels fine otherwise and is in hardcore ketosis but his pee isn't diluting.  It's still dark, as if he's dehydrated.  Will it take a while for his body to properly hydrate itself? There are no other signs of renal failure, but I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem. </TEXT>

Minute muffins are okay but I have IBS and they... slow things down even more.  Too much fiber can have adverse affects, even with extreme hydration.

<TITLE> Ketostix and Hydration </TITLE>

<TEXT> Back on the wagon, bought some more ketostix to keep myself motivated.  However, I realize the importance of being well hydrated on keto and so every time I try to use the ketostix, it registers a color between Neutral and Trace.  What should I do? Decrease water intake? Increase fats (even though I'm pretty much hitting my macros every day)?  I'm just frustrated from not knowing if I'm in ketosis.  

Disclaimer: I don't notice the acetone breath and dinosaur sweat pee, even when I did keto before and my ketostix registered a dark purple just after waking up.  I don't know why I can't recognize the other signs of ketosis, so honestly those physical signs don't really work for me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Back story: I smoked Spice (fake weed) for about a year, every day.  I quit thankfully, and don't even smoke trees as I'm afraid of its effects on me. I recently had an inner ear infection that left me perpetually dizzy and anxious for a week.  I got over it and have recently weaned myself completely off Zoloft and Ativan.

I finally feel like I'm getting back to normal, but I'll have spells where my perception feels off.  Like I feel a little lightheaded, I feel like the world around me is wrong.  I see everything normally, it's just a feeling in my head.  It's *almost* enough to trigger mild anxiety, but not quite enough.  

Has anyone else experienced this? I figure if it's an effect from coming off Zoloft and Ativan then it might get a response on here.

Even if it doesn't apply to you, hey, you're awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I obviously have a food addiction, most of which is associated with carbs.

I tried to start keto back in November, did it for a week, lost 10 pounds then gave up for some unknown reason.

Did the exact same thing in December.

I'm now realizing if I would have just sucked it up and suffered through the first couple weeks, I'd probably be down 30 pounds (or more) by now, but because I lacked the willpower necessary (and was a lazy fuck who made excuses), I'm still where I was in November.  Thankfully I haven't gained any since then.

Take this lesson, newbie ketoers, that if you stick with it you'll have progress pics to show off in just a few months.  

As for me, I've set goals for myself (a generous 8 months to lose 40 pounds).  I've discovered that I can like eggs if they're topped with salsa from my work's cafeteria. I've asked my new husband to encourage me to eat keto-friendly desserts (chocolate mousse... YUM) and have started parking in the garage across campus from my office so that I can get off my butt and work more.


Sorry, just needed to get that out there.  I'm starting fresh. Not putting a lot of pressure on myself.  Working through this carb addiction. Gonna be hotter stuff by my birthday in September. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trees and Anxiety/Depressive Disorders </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-04-06 00:29:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If this doesn't belong here, please direct me to where I should post this.  There are just so many ent subreddits that I'm just clueless.

First, my back story:

I have anxiety and depression.  The anxiety isn't constant but was recently exacerbated by an inner ear infection.  For a span of about 18 months between 2008 and 2010 I smoked "legal" substitues.  Yes, I know about how unhealthy it is and I quit after the newer blends were giving me panic attacks.  I recently convinced my new husband to switch to real trees, but I'm afraid about partaking myself with what happened before with the legal stuff.  I know they're completely different, but I'm still concerned.

That being said, is medical marijuana prescribed for anxiety and depressive disorders?  I've read about long-term smokers developing anxiety, supposedly because of the long-term use.

I don't live in a medical state, but I figured the best way to get a somewhat scientific/medical answer is to ask:

Is medical marijuana prescribed for the relief of anxiety disorders?  I know it's used for depression.  

I appreciate you, Ents. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sickness causing more anxiety? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-28 01:41:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've got anxiety, but thankfully my Zoloft keeps it pretty much under control.  

Friday night was hell for me, though.  I took a nap after dinner and woke up to what I thought was an immediate panic attack.  Rapid heart rate, the urge to get up and move, and a feeling of uneasiness lasted for **3 hours.**  I was in hell, so i had my husband take me to a non-hospital ER.  I was diagnosed as severely dehydrated, hooked up to an IV, and began to feel a little better.  Then the doctor finds what he thinks is a bacterial middle ear infection.

So I've been dizzy and my slight fever hasn't gone away even with antibiotics.  I went back to a regular doctor today.  She says I have a viral inner ear infection, explaining my dizziness and my fever being unresponsive to antibiotics. She gave me an EKG to see how my heart's doing, and just noticed a slight raise in HR (108 bpm), which usually happens to me when I'm sick or in pain.  

I've still been having very mild anxiety spells, though, followed by 30 minutes of me obsessively checking my pulse every 4 minutes or so.  Probably doesn't help the situation.  Does anyone know if this can be caused by the dizziness I'm experiencing?  Also, I've been having panic spells lasting about 3 minutes after I wake up, and I can't stay asleep for more than 90 minutes at a time.  My doctor couldn't explain this but I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this.

TL;DR - Inner ear infection causing dizziness, had mild panic spells (lasting max 30 seconds) since ER visit on Friday.  Mild panic spells for 3-5 minutes after waking.  Anyone else experienced this before? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll start this out by saying I'm not suicidal, nor have I ever been truly suicidal.  To be honest, I have a pretty good life.  I have a job with a major energy corporation, albeit a contract position.  I got married a week and a half ago to a wonderful supportive man who adores me. We adopted a kitten a few weeks ago.  

But my fucking job.  I loathe it.  I'm basically a data entry drone.  They're gradually giving me more responsibilities, but they haven't given any hints that I'll be offered a full time (salaried) position.  I'm an incredibly efficient worker and I finish my work pretty quickly (unintentionally).  When I finish my work, I'm sent home.  I fucking hate it, because as a newlywed and someone with student loans, I CANT AFFORD TO BE SENT HOME.  But I also can't slow down my work speed, I already have tried and realized I just can't.  

I don't want to go to a job where I have to interact with people.  I want to work from home.  I have incredible potential and know that I should be doing more with my life but by not getting an internship in college I royally screwed myself and am stuck at a soul-sucking job day in and day out, where my contract could end any day.

Not to mention I have had migraines the past couple months, and have missed more work than I should.  I got a talking to by my boss last week about it.  But yesterday she decided to come in hacking up a lung and now I'm feeling feverish.  It's just a shit ball rolling down shit hill and I just want to be out.

I'm sure most of us know what the job market is like right now; it's nearly impossible to find a job with limited experience.  This is my first professional job and I've only been there 3 1/2 months but I want something new.  

I don't know where I'm going with this... I just want a new job.  I want to work from home.

TL;DR: I'm too efficient at my job. I've been sick quite a bit recently and my boss just got me sick again, but I can't afford to miss work.  I want a more rewarding job, or to work from home, but the job market sucks.  My life is going well but I just feel like this job is sucking the life out of me. </TEXT>

I fasted all day because of that then for dinner my fiance and I made [green chili and jack chicken](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/green_chile_jack_chicken.html), [fried "rice,"](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/fried_rice.html) and [low carb brownies](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/brownies.html).

<TEXT> I was prescribed metformin a couple years ago. The first time I tried taking it I had unpleasant digestive issues. My doctor promised me that I would lose weight, but I couldn't bear those side effects. I restarted keto on Tuesday and started Metformin again simultaneously. Not only do I not have keto flu or the digestive issues, I don't crave carbs. Last time I tried keto the cravings were way too strong and it was taking a toll on my stress levels. 

I last weighed myself on Sunday and I was 200.4. I weighed this morning and I'm already down to 196.8! I have never lost weight that fast before, even when I tried keto in November. 

I implore you to take your Metformin. I know the pills are big, chalky, and disgusting if you don't swallow them fast enough. But those side effects I can handle and are worth the increased rate of weight loss.  </TEXT>

Salaam!  Let me just start by saying I think Islam is a beautiful religion and I consider Muslims to be my religious cousins ( [borrowing from the familial relationship spoken of Christians in Scripture](http://www.openbible.info/topics/brothers_and_sisters_in_christ) ).  

Could someone explain why veils are worn? Would it be comparable to a Christian wearing a cross necklace, as an outward sign of devotion to God? 

There isn't much about this topic in the Bible except in the Pentateuch (Genesis-Deuteronomy) and an exerpt in [1 Corinthians 11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2011:2-16 version=ESV).  The verses in the Pentateuch are dismissed as ancient Israelite traditions that were done away with after the resurrection of Christ.  The 1 Corinthians excerpt is usually boiled down to 1st century Roman society, where a married woman always had her hair covered as a symbol of devotion to her husband.  A married woman who had her hair uncovered (or down) in public was seen as dishonoring her husband by acting like an unmarried woman.

I'm assuming the reasoning for wearing veils has nothing to do with honoring one's husband, as there were a few girls in hijabs at my middle school.  This leads me to believe it's an outward sign of devotion and honor to God (Allah).

Thank you for your help!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've all seen the threads asking about good Christian music.  Something my friend and I love to do is recall really bad Christian music from our childhood and laugh about how cheesy it is.

Some examples:

[Mary, Did You Know? by Mark Lowry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0WIJw8JVeU)

[Screen Door by Rich Mullins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcvBsNcIzu4)

I guess it never struck me before, but this verse is saying love trumps even faith itself.  Faith is on what so many Christians nowadays rely.  I can't tell you how many times I've read 1 Cor 13 and for some reason, today, this jumped out at me.   </TEXT>

The job I start tomorrow is, from what I was told, a repetitive data entry job at a major oil/energy company.  I'll thankfully be making enough to where I can move out in a matter of months.  There are tons of pros to this other than financial, like opportunities and just experience.

I'm still freaking out.  I'm terrified I'll suck at the job.  I've got minor anxiety, which doesn't help of course.  I know asking questions is encouraged but I'm still afraid to do so.

Anyone else have a lower level desk job who has worked retail or other service jobs in the past who can send me some encouragement/advice??? </TEXT>

<TEXT> After over 2 years of engagement, I finally set my wedding date for March 10.  In the last 3 months I've let my emotions get the best of me and I've gained 20 pounds, so my dress doesn't fit anymore.  

So, the things that keep me going are:

* 
The thought of my wedding dress fitting (or better yet: having to be taken in)


* 
The effects of my PCOS and insulin resistance will have subsided.  This includes unsightly things such as random facial hair


* 
Changes in how I feel every day.  Chances are the heartburn will be reduced (according to doctor and various personal sources) and more energy.  


* 
Won't have the urge to give into emotional eating.

I would really like to hear some other motivational thoughts that kept you going through the induction/detox phase.  Maybe there are some others out there just starting out who will benefit from them too. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2011-11-07 23:53:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was on Zoloft for about a year at a high dosage.  The only positive thing I could say about it was that I lost 50 lbs on it.  I stopped my habit of emotional eating.  Everything else sucked.  I became an apathetic zombie.  My sex drive was way down, and it has remained so after being off it for a month now.  

I'm now sure that I don't need an SSRI, but I do need some kind of medication.  I don't have insurance to visit my doctor, but I've been going to my GP my entire life and he'll change my prescription with a free phone or email consultation.  I've heard good things about sex drive and personality on Wellbutrin and I think an NDSI might help me a lot more.  

What side effects have you experienced on Wellbutrin?  If you have experience with both Zoloft and Wellbutrin, which do you do better on and why?  I'm aware that my brain chemistry is specific to me, but I'd like to hear personal experiences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Three days this week I've tried W1D1 and can't find the strength or energy to finish it.  Before this week I decided to warm up by just walking the 3 miles for 4 days in a row, but I guess it didn't help very much.

I think one problem is my breathing.  I breathe through my mouth and I don't seem to inflate my lungs enough.  Breathing through my nose makes my nose burn for days afterwards and my lungs still end up hurting.  I get about 3/4 of the way done and I end up having to skip one minute of running just to stop my excruciating chest/lung pains.

Does anyone have any advice? Any resources to send to me about running/breathing/etc...?  The posts here are very encouraging and I'm just getting really down on myself because I can't complete the first day. </TEXT>

So I'm going tonight to get a few inches chopped off, and I was wondering if you ladies had any suggestions as to how I should wear it.

I've been going with a straightened simple pony.  I have hesitations about wearing it down because I tend to play with my hair, especially when I'm nervous.  I plan on keeping it medium length at least, but other than that I'm clueless as to what to do.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I will preface this by saying that this question is more for the resident atheists of r/Christianity, but anyone is welcome to weigh in of course.  I am not seeking to involve myself in a back and forth discussion, I just want to hear your opinions.

Logic is not instinctual in human beings.  From personal experience, the classes that myself and many other people I know had difficulty with in university were philosophical or mathematical logic.  Acting emotionally, however, seems to be very instinctual to human beings.  My question is this:

Do you consider emotion-based belief to be incorrect and if so, why (when considering the emotional instinct we all have)?

Also, why is logic considered superior when it is also a set of rules coined by ancient philosophers? 

It might be a good thing to mention I have a degree in mathematics, so I understand why logic is important from a mathematical perspective.

Mods, I apologize if this belongs in a different subreddit.  I don't dare post it to r/atheism, and I decided against r/debatereligion because I don't plan on being very involved in this discussion.  I merely want to observe responses/opinions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The past month I've been in the biggest depressive state I can remember.  My sleep schedule had been from 6am - 4pm daily, my Zoloft wasn't working, and I barely left my bed.  I wouldn't leave my apartment for days on end and when I did, it was to go get M Ms and drown my sorrows in junk food.

Two days ago I decided enough was enough.  I started taking my Adderall again, and I've gone for 3 mile walks every morning.  My sleep schedule is closer to normal now, and I have an interview today.

I hope this serves as encouragement for someone out there feeling as hopeless as I did.  Seriously, get off your ass and go for a walk, even if it's just 10 minutes.  Download a podcast (I recommend Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me, it's pretty funny) and just stroll.  It's amazing how depressing sitting in front of a computer/TV all day can be.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm getting pretty tired of Moffat/writers ignoring the TARDIS translation circuit.  A few examples are: when the Doctor speaks baby, when the Doctor translates the Krafayis's last words as it's dying, the Doctor translating the alien Minotaur's final words in the God Complex... the list goes on. There should be no excuse for the TARDIS not translating this.  If the Doctor knows all these languages, the TARDIS definitely should.  The only exception should be Gallifreyan (as mentioned in this subreddit before), so that non-Time Lord TARDIS thieves wouldn't be able to pilot her.

Any other discontinuities out there that are pissing people off?  This part of DW canon that is being ignored by Moffat is unacceptable to me.  There have been dozens of other directors who have done DW just as well as Moffat, why does he get to rewrite everything? Don't even mention Big Bang 2 because that was a cheap attempt of shaking the DW etch-a-sketch. </TEXT>

I lost 50 pounds after my dad's passing but didn't exercise so I figured I was good to go.  Fast forward 8 months after my weight loss subsided and I've gained 15 back, so I decided to give C25K another go.  

I did W1D1 yesterday outside on a local trail.  It was hard, even though I'm 35 pounds lighter than I was before.  I had to distract myself from looking at my shadow, and I felt like I was barely moving when I was running even though I was exhausted.  But I'm excited!

I've gained some back (I'm at about 181 right now) and I need to get my motivation back.  Since I graduated I haven't been walking (big college campuses supplemented for exercise).  TBH I think most of the weight loss happened as a result of my father's death.  He suffered from severe anxiety and depression and that rubbed off on me.  After he passed away much of my anxiety and depression was gone, including my emotional eating habits.  While I was losing weight I was drinking Cokes (not diet) and the weight just kept falling off (it was weird).  I've fallen back into the bored eating routine again, and I think putting this up here will motivate me to get back on track.

I've tried submitting my resume to temp agencies, I've tried r/HoustonJobs, Craigslist, Indeed, Monster, CareerBuilder, CollegeGrad, RigZone, etc... but haven't found anything.  

I got some on here to look at my resume a while back and took all the advice and it's looking pretty good.  What should I be doing that I'm not? It's not practical for me to walk into a big corporation and ask for the HR manager and many companies don't list their information on the website.  Any advice? Any companies you know of to whom I should be applying?

Basic info: B.S. in Mathematics with an overall GPA of roughly 2.8.  Advanced proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite including Access and Outlook, intermediate proficiency in SAP, SPSS, MatLab, R, just learning Python, C#, and VisualBasic.

I've tried applying for careers in almost every field, mainly focusing my search to analyst positions.

Any help would be greatly appreciated and I can provide a link to my resume if requested. </TEXT>

To whom do I talk? Do I ask for the HR manager? I've been using internet job boards to no avail and tomorrow plan on getting out there but what are some things I need to know beforehand?

Edit: For clarification, I just graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics and am looking for a corporate analyst position (business, financial, risk, compensation, etc...).  I'm 24 and located in a booming business city (Houston, TX if you must know) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Resume critiques... again. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Third time posting to r/resumes. I've taken suggestions and revamped my resume to better showcase myself.  I'd love critiques.  

NOTES: 

* The actual .doc format is one page, but for some reason googledocs extended it to two.
* I didn't include my overall GPA because when my father died in the middle of the semester, the trauma of finding his body overcame my ability to finish the semester. I couldn't drop out due to financial aid, and as a result my GPA went down the toilet.

Also, along the lines of GPA, can I calculate my GPA from the credits that applied towards my degree?  That is, if I failed a class and re-took it, could I calculate it without the failed course factoring into my GPA? Or is that professionally dishonest?

<TITLE> Prayer/assistance requests </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-29 22:04:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, I have a couple prayer requests.  They may seem petty to some, but I'm really struggling and need some guidance.  I graduated a couple weeks ago from university after the most emotionally tumultuous  5 years of my life and I'm stuck.  I can't get a call back for an interview.  I wasn't involved in many things during university and didn't have any internships.  I have a BS in Math and I've applied to every analyst position I can find, tweaking my cover letter for every company.  My health insurance runs out September 1st and I can't afford to renew it, much less pay my bills.  I would really appreciate some prayer or suggestions for my situation.  While you're at it, please pray for those who are facing even more difficult times than I am in this broken world.

Second, I have a friend who is 8 months pregnant.  Her husband is a youth minister, she's on leave from her hourly retail position.  They have a 2 year old daughter but donated her baby clothes as she grew out of them, and they're lacking clothes/accessories for their newcomer.  If anyone could assist in this it would be greatly appreciated.  [Here's the post I put in r/babyexchange.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyExchange/comments/jy9ti/request_infant_clothesitems_for_a_baby_girl/)

I apologize for using r/Christianity in this way for those of you who may disagree with this post.  I just have nowhere else to turn.  After 4 weeks of pulling my hair out from rejection emails, I'm lost.  

Thanks y'all.  Love you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Request] Infant clothes/items for a baby girl, newborn - 1 year, Houston, TX </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-29 21:51:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This sub was suggested to me by r/Assistance.  I think it's such a great idea!

I have a friend who is almost 8 months along.  They have one little girl already (2 years) but they donated her baby clothes as she outgrew them.  They're not super poor, but I doubt they have enough to buy their baby a whole new wardrobe.  They haven't had a baby shower yet and I'm not sure if they even will, so I was wondering if anyone had any clothes they'd like to donate to the cause.  The husband is a church worker and the wife has been on leave from her hourly retail job for a couple months.  I'd love to surprise them with a box full of clothing and accessories for little Harper so they aren't spending their own hard-earned but limited money when she arrives.  

Someone also suggested something of a digital baby shower on r/assistance and that would be great, too, but it's not necessary.

So if anyone wants to donate clothes/accessories/money to this cause, PM me and I'll give you all the information you need/request.

I'm a long-time redditor, check me out if you so choose :)  </TEXT>

They already have one little girl but gave away all of her baby clothes after she outgrew them (not smart on her part).  She and her husband don't make very much and can't afford to go out and buy brand new clothes for their newcomer, and nobody has thrown her a baby shower. 

I'd love to surprise her with a box full of clothes to choose from when little Harper arrives.  Does anyone have any they can spare? PM me for info :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is Jesus referred to as God's one and only Son? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-28 19:25:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I never understood this.  Jesus is a part of the Trinity, therefore He is God through the trinitarian relationship with God the "Father" and the Holy Spirit.  Does that make the Holy Spirit the crazy uncle of the bunch who watches us when we sleep?  To me, Jesus being the Son of God seems to imply that God the Father has supreme authority, but that's not the way the Trinity works.  They're all equally God and in sync with one another.

I'm assuming it has to do with the trinitarian relationship, but I never quite grasped this title of Son. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gnostic vs. Agnostic Christianity: To which do you ascribe? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-26 20:25:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I grew up thinking agnostic was a viewpoint similar to atheism, where someone just doesn't know or care if there is a God or not.  After coming to reddit, however, I've learned the true definition of this classification.  Here are the definitions of gnostic and agnostic, respectively: 

* **gnostic** Adjective: Of or relating to knowledge, esp. esoteric mystical knowledge.
* **agnostic** Adjective: asserting the uncertainty of all claims to knowledge.

Online dictionaries tell me that I was partially correct in my original thinking, but I prefer this definition to associate with my faith.  I have never had a "supernatural" experience of God outside feelings, coincidences, and situations.  I have no absolute certainty that God exists.

I'd really like to hear others' views on this and to which you ascribe and why.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Medical/Genetics question regarding cancer/gender/mortality </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-25 16:44:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me preface this question by giving some insight into my family history.

* **My mother's side of my family**: Her father, and all the men on his side of the family end up dying of cancer by the time they're 60, with the exception of my great-uncle.  My mother says he's "pickled" because he was an alcoholic his entire life and lived to be 79.  I doubt that, but it's not really relevant to my question.  The women on her father's side live to be 85 or older, as do the women on her mother's side.  There have hardly been any men on her mother's side of the family, and those that I do know of have had similar fates to her father's side (dying of something by the time they're 60 - 65)

* **My father's side of the family** is basically the same, with the men dying of heart disease or cancer by the time they're 65 (my father died last year at 60 from hypertensive cardiovascular disease). My grandmother on this side lived to be 90, her sister to 94, and their mother to 90.


So my question is this:

* Can susceptibility cancer and disease be genetically gender-specific? That is, since I'm a female do I have a higher chance of living longer than if I was a male?

<TEXT> I'm a recent mathematics graduate, but I'm finding the jobs I have the best shot at have to do with programming of some sort, or with data analysis (SQL, Access, Oracle).

I bought a book on VisualBasic and Access 2007 but I want to teach myself a programming language.  Which one is the best for self-teaching for a career? I took *one* class in undergrad, and they'd teach Pascal or Fortran depending on which semester taken.  I unfortunately took the Pascal semester, which I didn't do too well in and have also heard that Pascal isn't even used for anything anymore.  I've heard C, C++, or Java are the way to go, but I'd like some more experienced opinions.

<TEXT> The 5 years I spent in college taking my undergrad were emotional hell, so I didn't have the emotional capacity to apply for internships or take initiative in building up my networks/connections. 

I'm going to a career fair hosted by my school next week, but my resume looks so lame.  I've put all the job experience I've had, the computer programs I can use, but with a bachelors in maths with no minor (one research project and a few good references), I'm absolutely terrified and discouraged to even send in my resume to businesses focused in the financial sector.  Ultimately I'd like to be an actuary, and there are a few internship opportunities for which I'd be willing to apply.  

Any advice? So far I've used a resume template that makes it stick out from the standard word-processor resumes.  What computer programs are invaluable to know for business related careers?  </TEXT>

My fiance and I were the ones to discover his body and I'm still not finished grieving.  I went to therapy to deal with the trauma of finding him, but grief has its own way of doing things.  

I've been having a rough past couple of days, and I can tell tomorrow's going to be even worse.  My mother grieved the loss of my father while he was still alive, so she's been able to move on with minimal grief.  I however am still grieving and am basically all alone in this. It's also my last week of college and so I've got the stress of studying for an advanced mathematics final to add on top of everything else.

I'm taking the next few days off from reddit in an attempt to get my emotions straightened out and could really do with some encouraging words or prayers.

Anyone on here have suggestions on a place that will just look at my car and pass it without offering five extra things it "needs to have done?"  I don't have the patience or money to deal with this and would rather avoid the BS altogether.

Edit: I was misinformed, thanks to mypetition and CanadianGal25 for clearing this up.  I probably should have noted that the only information I have on the translation is what I heard in passing in a religious studies course.

Edit 2: When I said in my first draft that KJV was a flawed text, EarBucket summed up what I meant with the KJV's source being the TR:

The Textus Receptus has over six thousand variants from the earliest Greek texts. It contains portions that were translated back into Greek from the Vulgate because they didn't have Greek texts available. Most scholars today don't give priority to the TR. </TEXT>

<TITLE> One year ago today was the last time I saw my daddy alive.  I miss him. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-07-30 22:05:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The deterioration of his mental health after losing his job caused so much stress on my family.  He refused to take heart medicine after he lost the business, and the final years of his life he was basically waiting around to die.  He was working a menial contract delivery job, and used the money he earned to give me spending money, buy cigarettes, and buy junk food.  

I still miss him, though, even though his poor financial choices almost broke our family.  He was the goofiest person alive and knew how to make me smile when I was stressed from school or my job.  

He passed away 8/2/2010.  I saw him July 30, 2010 for the last time.  We went to pick him up to drive him up to KC, MO from Texas for my sister's wedding.  When we got there he said he couldn't go.  I was furious, I thought it was from his mental instability and anxiety associated with long-distance travel.  I walked out of the apartment while my fiance talked to him, but something inside me told me to go back and tell him how much I love him and hug him

Looking back, he must have known.  That was the last time I saw my father was the first time I saw him cry.  The entire time we were in KC, my fiance and I had the feeling we'd come back to find him dead, but not from heart attack.  We thought he would kill himself.  When we got back to the apartment on 8/2, I conveniently went to check the mail while my fiance went to check on my dad.  As I was walking up to our building, my fiance comes rushing out, phone in hand, giving me the "STOP RIGHT THERE" hand sign and look on his face.  It was the longest night of my life, and I was still convinced it was suicide.  It wasn't until I got the death certificate a few weeks later that "atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease" became the most relieving words I had ever read.

I'm miserable today.  I'm having fits of sobbing, stuffing my face with junk food.

<TEXT> I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people&#8212; not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.

*What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?* God will judge those outside. &#8220;Expel the wicked person from among you.&#8221;

1 Cor 5:9-13

This chapter is the reason Christians like myself choose not to associate ourselves with hate-mongering groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church, who claim to be our "brothers and sisters" but their platform is one of slander and hatred towards those outside the church.

I think Paul got it right: we have enough crap to deal with inside the church body to start judging and enforcing our beliefs on those outside.

My dad lost his business right before I started in 2006 and he passed away unexpectedly last August.  I have changed majors twice, colleges three times, and failed classes due to a drug problem and depression.

Today I took my last CLEP test and passed, meaning that assuming I pass my current summer school course, I wil be graduating in August.  This is also assuming financial aid goes through for the summer, but if it doesn't we should have a way of paying through my mom's or grandmother's credit union.

I am beyond excited to pick up my cap and gown, and now that I'm graduating, I am one step closer to marrying the love of my life.  We've been engaged for 2 years but we know well enough to wait until after we've graduated and have careers to tie the knot.  

I'M GRADUATING!  I've been doing a happy dance for the last 30 minutes since getting home from the test.  Just had to share :))))) </TEXT>

I've started taking it upon myself to communicate my feelings on Houston policy with the mayor via her email mayor@houstontx.gov.  Today I got a letter back consisting of just two sentences that satisfied me:

Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding Houston Police Department 
officers with me.  The officer referenced in the news article has been relieved of 
duty, and an investigation has been instigated. 

[Here's a copy](http://www.scribd.com/doc/60285980/Re-HPD-Officer-Punches-Suspect-07-18-11) of the letter emailed to me.

<TEXT> I know this sub probably gets this asked all the time, but do I have a shot in the actuarial field? I've been taking 18+ hours a semester trying to finish my BS in maths.  I have excellent references from professors and past employers, but no internships or relevant financial experience. I'm studying this summer for the first exam and plan on taking it as soon as I can after I graduate in August.  I live in Houston, so there are many actuarial opportunities as it is a large corporate hub.  I have good resume boosters like volunteer work and tutoring, but nothing spectacular.

Help me, actuaries.  Do I have a decent shot at getting a job in the first 6 months after graduation? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I grew up in a Southern Baptist church, where all I ever heard in youth group was 

Don't have sex, because you will get pregnant and die. Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up... Just... dont' do it, okay?

As you can probably guess, that had a significant impact on my own sexuality.  I never explored my body; rather, I was ashamed of it.  Though I'm still a Christian I wholeheartedly disagree with that approach to it, as it usually results in rebellion or shame (at least in my youth group it did). Thankfully my fiance encouraged me to have discussions about our sexual life, and he eventually gave me this book that we could read together and since then my attitude about sex and my own sexuality have greatly improved.

If you or your SO aren't comfortable with your sexuality because of what you've been taught at church or from your parents, please pick up this book: [Sheet Music by Kevin Lehman](http://www.amazon.com/Sheet-Music-Uncovering-Intimacy-Marriage/dp/0842360247).  It's a very frank book about sexual intimacy in a Christian marriage and the misconceptions the church places on its young people.  It deals with all kinds of relationships, too: two virgins raised in the faith, more experienced individuals, sufferers of sexual abuse, etc... The only poor reviews are ultra feminists claiming it to be misogynistic (it isn't) or ultra conservatives claiming it to be smut (again, it isn't).

[Here's an excerpt](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FArUKp-O6Sw/ThH_Gz1NCbI/AAAAAAAAAHE/osPCM3a_Suc/s1600/SheetMusicExcerpt.jpg).

Also, feel free to share any opinions or stories of growing up in the church and its affect on your sexuality.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Yet another pesky River Song theory/question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-07-08 23:12:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we were moffucked again a few days ago when Moffat said we still know nothing about River. What if her entire persona around the Doctor is an act, as she had been trained to do by those who raised her? What if she is really the bad guy in all of this? Is that even a possibility?

Also, I'm starting to think River and 11 aren't very romantically involved. I'm thinking the Stevie Wonder and Singing Towers Doctor is a future incarnation, especially since the screwdriver he gave River (for the Library) is not 11's screwdriver. She says it's his screwdriver (as opposed to a screwdriver), and 10's was destroyed in the Eleventh Hour.

Am I thinking too much? This break is destroying me. Thank heavens for Torchwood tonight. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a friend who is pregnant.  A couple months ago, they found out the baby wasn't developing properly.  Its organs are outside of its body, and its face is very disfigured.  The family of the girl are very pro-life and have had a difficult time finding a doctor that didn't want to abort the baby.  They found one, and they are testing to see if its a chromosomal abnormality.  If it is, they'll make the baby as comfortable as possible and let it pass once it's born.  If not, the doctors can do something about it (I'm not sure how but they say they can).

Now, I'm pro-life except in extreme cases where the mother is in danger, but now I'm thinking I'd be okay with an abortion in this situation.  I believe babies who die go to heaven.  I'd just like some input for the future, as this family has already made their choice in the matter. Extreme complications in pregnancy could happen to anyone, and just in case it happens to me at some point, I'd like to have opinions from well-rounded Christians such as you guys. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is [action] considered a sin? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-06-20 22:19:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen many posts recently asking why certain actions are sin, mostly relating to homosexuality.  I need analysis of something I was taught by a theologically well-rounded Reverend (meaning, he has a Masters of Divinity).

He first referred me to Romans 6:23

For the wages of sin is **death** but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord

The reason he emphasized death, is that it refers us to the actions listed in the OT that are sinful.  That is, if an action's consequence is death in the OT, it's considered sinful post-resurrection.  He also told me I had to take into account the role of women in those times, and we had to alter it to fit the current worldview.  Women in the Torah were treated as submissives to men, not because the Torah commanded it, but because the role of women in those days was extremely submissive.  

For example, there's the following:

Rape of someone who is engaged. If she is not engaged you only have to marry her and give her father 50 shekels. No mention is made of the girl&#8217;s opinion. (Deut 22:25)

We're all aware of the dowry system of marriage, where a father basically "sells" his daughter to the best man who comes along.  The selling of a high price assured that the daughter would be going to a home worthy enough for her, by her father's opinion. 

I did some research and came across [this](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Actions_which_demand_the_death_penalty_in_the_Old_Testament) article. I personally don't perceive banishment to be the same as death, and I don't think Jesus nor Paul did either.  Jesus encouraged people to give up everything and follow him, which in Jewish law would be abandoning ones family or banishing themselves. 

Anyways, this entire rambling is just to ask others' opinions about the reasoning this Reverend gave me.  

As for premarital sex and sexual promiscuity, I recently read a comment that explained very well the benefits of [waiting until marriage](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/i31yo/any_redditors_who_waited_until_marriage_to_have/c20jv10)

TL;DR: Reverend answered a question I had about what constitutes sin, would appreciate feedback.  His reasoning: if the consequence was death in the Torah, it's a sin now.

<TEXT> The doctor saw a silent in his TARDIS before and after asking rory about why amy   river are cross.  That's something I didn't notice before.  But my question is this:

why was the doctor an idiot at flying the TARDIS on his way to the oval office? River corrected him a few times (scanner, invisibility, silencing the engines) and it doesn't make sense.  it's just a random thing that occurs.... which is why i think it's important.  

Something about this is screaming TARDIS but I can't figure it out.  Stetson doctor didn't interact with the TARDIS  at all.  why not?  why send the invitations if he could just hop over and pick everyone up?

**EDIT** I'm watching it over and scrutinizing every scene.  The scene where they initially get to FL and are using their flashlights (or torches) to get around, you see a spaceman watching them. Look in the reflection of his mask and you can see the doctor acknowledge him.  I'm going with River Song's number one rule on this one... *the doctor lies* </TEXT>
