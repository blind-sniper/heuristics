<TEXT> This includes composites of other actors' roles, as well as particular characters. 

Also: exclude the fact that he played Jesus Christ in the film Pilgrim's Progress.

Y'all can add in more roles that he has played, but right off the top of my head, he has played:

Ras Al-Ghul    
Gawain (Excalibur)   
Qui-Gon Jinn    
Oskar Schindler     
Aslan (Narnia)   
Zeus (Clash of the Titans)   
The guy from the Taken movies

Edit: Rounds for this.

Round 1: using movie roles only. 

Round 2: using source material only. 

Round 3: anything and everything goes (except for the Jesus thing) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keeping it short since the case is under review. 

Main details: officer found my pipe and less than 3 grams in a not quite Bible Belt but still conservative state  (Indiana).    
I was charged with misdemeanor possession of Marijuana and paraphernalia. I'm now on at least a 5 year hiatus, pending I move to a legal state. </TEXT>

<TITLE> It happened </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-28 21:03:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my headlight went out, and I did not know it until I was pulled over. I had a roach sitting just to the right of my registration papers, which the officer saw. He then cuffed me and put me in his cruiser. He searched the vehicle (using the roach as probable cause) and found my script and less than 3 grams of Marijuana. I spent the night in jail, learned a lot about life, and almost made it through Pride and Prejudice (the book). 

So I have court next Thursday, and am meeting with a lawyer to get the misdemeanors talked down to something else...I have one for the weed; and one for my pipe. This is officially the beginning of a very extended break from marijuana (at least 5 years) and other drugs (whenever I'm financially stable again)

Edit: I'd like to add in that the officer never read me my Miranda rights, nor did anyone else who booked me acknowledge that those rights exist. 

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for your support, stories, and insight. I feel a little bit more optimistic about upcoming events.

Edit 3: I met with my lawyer today. We are likely going through pre trial diversion which involves me either going to NA meetings and the sort, or submitting to random drug tests. </TEXT>

<TITLE> We shouldn't arrest the people who use and possess drugs. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Millions, likely a couple billion, adults around the world consume a drug in some form, be it from a prescription, DNM, dealer, or other method. 

And yet, people go to jail for exercising their right to put a substance into their body. As long as they aren't a threat to themselves (think suicide) or the lives and property of others, people should be allowed to be as drugged (or sober) as they please.

Picture this: you're 18 years old, you have a couple MDMA pills and some bud (I'm talking less than a quarter) and an officer arrests you. If you're arrested somewhere more right leaning, they'll make an example of you, give you a felony, make you almost unemployable for life. Do they really expect you to be able to support yourself if they put a marker on your record that makes companies pass over you? No...this is how we create legacy criminals. 

Disclaimer: I'm not trying to generalize, I've just seen it happen more than it should. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As she lays in her hospital bed, she slowly gets foggy, more confused by the minute. And yet, you can see the pain in her eyes, clear as daylight. The nurse sends another drip through the IV. Her eyes lower, the pain gradually subsides, but that fugue, that damn fugue. 

She can't process what I'm saying, but she can hear my voice. It's the only reassurance she has. She says they have her so drunked up she can't think or see. I tell her to close her eyes, to try to relax, and catch what fleeting sleep she can. The surgery in the morning will drain her. She needs her strength to recover in the future, not to agonize in this moment.     

She comes back, a couple hours later, confused, wanting to talk and relax, but the comfort is not there. The painkillers do their job, but they ravage her mind. And so, they slowly dull the one part of her that is still sharp. She can't hardly walk, or take care of herself anymore, but her mind is still sharp. It saddens me to see her like this.

I cannot understand her distaste for the pain killers. She hates them so much, but she knows it's the only thing keeping her from being awake all night writhing and screaming.

These are the same things I would enjoy recreationally. Yet, I do not share this information. I can only wiggle in my chair, or think of how good a nod would be...just to forget that this is happening, if even for a moment. 

I weather through, and made it to today, sober, and no longer thinking of that urge. </TEXT>

By images, I mean he used to look the stereotypical emo part (jet black hair swooped to one side, brooding attitude, blaring Hawthorne Heights, and being an angsty mess in general) but now he's switched over to the "clean cut" look...mainly for the same reasons I had been telling him for a few years...good women like it more and people give you fewer dirty looks. 

I was also worried about being judged for everything...I told him about how I got hooked on Percocet, I've done the mainstream hard drugs (except for crack) I've taken benzos  (usually kpins or xans) I've done Stims, I've dropped L, I've tripped on shrooms, I've done X. And the best part was...no judgment, mainly because he was like "hey, you're an adult, you seem like you have your shit together" and then he told me a few stories of other people doing stuff, and then going overboard with it.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This has probably been asked a million times, but I believe that God is a human construct, and we all be good in any God's eyes, depending on our subjective viewpoint of what is good and what is evil. For every protagonist, there is an antagonist, and these can both flip based on perception. So we should examine why humans had the need to create a God. I have two thoughts on this: there are things we haven't found explanations for, so we use God as a means of filling that knowledge void, and also as a means of reassurance behind our insecurities (prayer or other rituals)

<TEXT> With that title, you would think I'm talking about cocaine. I'm not. The drug I'm talking about is sobriety. Well, except for the endorphins produced during a runners high. Anyway, I had a break on Tuesday night when I decided that I needed to slow down and smell the roses, or whatever shitty clich&#233; goes here. Anyway, I have been completely sober for the past 5 days, save for when I run. I honestly don't know how I feel...serendipitous, I guess. It's like I'm meeting me again, if you know what I mean. I'm discovering old things about myself. I'm going to keep up with the running, see if I can't enter a few events. I'm going to focus even more on getting my MBA. I'm not even going to buy anything when I get paid on Friday.

All in all, I'm interested in seeing where my mind goes, and I'll probably return to smoking in a couple weeks or a month, but I'm probably not going to go into anything more serious again for a while if ever. </TEXT>

This was my first weekend of smoking almost an ounce in a long ass time, so I'm probably going to take a T break so I can reset and/or not bankrupt myself lol </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The last 2 days have been hard on me. It's been 1 year since my cousin committed suicide and all my emotions resurfaced. We were each other's closest family members; what with his mom ODing, his Dad ignoring him completely, his brother in and out of jail, most of the family not caring. He stayed with his grandpa who he never felt he could really talk to about things. I talked to him an hour before he passed, and everything seemed fine. He just got promoted to foreman at a construction place in Kansas City, he met a new girl, and said he was recently Baptized. 

I found out a few hours after that call while I was work. I had to leave because I broke down on the spot...there was no chance of keeping it together. 

I met more of his friends from high school and life (we grew up about 4 hours apart, and didn't see each other often) and I could see how much he was loved, how much he will be missed. 

I saw some of the photos on Facebook that people were tagging him in yesterday, reminiscing over his influence in their lives.

He wasn't even 21 at the time...so much youth, so much life, taken away from us. 

Thank you all for reading this and being here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the day I turned 18, I went to hang out with my best friend at the time and his family. His parents pulled out about half an ounce and gave it to us for my birthday. I wound up smoking with them that day, and the outpour of thoughts and life advice were so sincere. 

His parents were complete opposites on almost everything except for green: they both smoked. He was the clean cut military type, and she looked like the hippie stereotype. He told me about his time in the military (he was in just after the Vietnam War) and the insight into how they make it through everything in life, from raising a family to finding one's Zen, helped me grow a bit as a person,  and what they said that day makes even more sense now </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I officially hit my 6 year mark of smoking weed a couple weeks back. I started reflecting a bit and I realized the more I smoke, the more I gravitate toward an older crowd (I'm almost 22, so I'm still in the young smoker group) I'd rather smoke with older people who I can sit around, talk to, blaze with, and learn about life. There's no bravado, no bragging about being "turnt" or "fucked up" just a collective understanding that we've all been high before, we've all partied before, but we prefer to keep things a bit more chill and lowkey. 

I've mellowed out to the point where the things I used to worry about seem so insignificant now. </TEXT>

It wasn't until after work that my manager asked if I smoked, and by instinct, I said smoke what.? So; he knows I smoke, and I haven't found a decent time to ask him if he does. 

Sorry for the unrelated story. To answer your question, I use weed to cope with my comedowns. It regulates out my appetite, so I actually remember to eat. Good food puts me in a great mood.  </TEXT>

Well, he runs me to his dealers house and he picks up some more bud on top of what I already have, as well as about 12 Vyvanse. Anyway, my brother and I take one 70mg capsule each (he breaks the capsule but I don't). We then go to a house party where everyone is either crossfaded or tripping on acid. It was a fun ass night thus far. We went to a titty bar and enjoyed the show as well as free drinks. But yeah, I'm back at my friends house now, where the tripping roommates are playing NBA 2k15 and the high/speeding people are playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. 

I'll probably take another capsule to power through work. Might look up if I can snort it so I can knock that craving of snorting a line of anything out of my way. </TEXT>

I didn't think I was feeling it until I got my perpetual stim jaw clench (yes I have magnesium on deck) and I'm about to go take my weekend by storm. Yes, I have to work tomorrow, but I can push through another 8 hour day, and get a good deep sleep after work. My mind is racing but my thoughts are so focused.

I've stayed an hour over just to make sure a customer got exactly what they came in for. The point is, the people who complain about having to deal with someone 5 minutes before close are the people who either need some time off to relax, or need to find a different field of employment. Yes, it's inconvenient, but my belief is that if you pass on good values and great service, the karma will come back around in other aspects of your life. </TEXT>

Anyway, I feel like I might be a polysubstance dependent person, not addicted to any one thing, but enjoying the deviation from sobriety. If I'm broke, I'm drunk off of cheap liquor and high on Reggie. If the money is good, I still drink the same liquor (I love the taste) but smoke kush. I'm always looking for the next thing I can try,  but if I can find Xanax, Crack (on occasion) or another drug I can be at parties on, I want to do it/try it if I haven't already. I just wanted to open up a bit about me to people who won't condemn me for living the life I live, or won't talk to me because I do certain things, or have access to them.

<TEXT> Mr. Sanders,

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read over and answer some of our questions. I would almost consider this AMA a more modernized, albeit, less face to face, version of a town hall meeting. 
    
With that in mind, I am wondering what other communication styles you had planned, what with trying to get a forward thinking campaign moving under a third party banner. Do you feel that there are extra obstacles to be cleared because of your status as a third party candidate, and how do you plan on handling said obstacles? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the title goes, I thought I found a girl who I would have been dating, but I found her apparent deal-breaker: she thinks it's the worst thing ever to smoke pot, yet she tried to claim that she supports medical marijuana.     

I then explained the differences in weed in illegal states, adding that we can't have dispensaries around, so it is difficult to find low THC, high CBD strains in decent quantity or frequency.     

She then sent me a message telling me her last boyfriend apparently lied to her about smoking. My thought is that if I'm honest with it, it won't be an issue.   

 Edit: I've seen all of the honesty related comments. I don't lie to people I care about.

The issue might be (if you look into my post history) I like drug use. So I might just be marking another girl off the already short "girls who are interested in me" list. Yes this is whiny. No, I don't really care right now.

I wanted to hear the subs thoughts.

Bonus: I forgot I asked her to watch The Culture High a couple months back, which she followed through on. So, I guess I made a little progress.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hahaha the first time I got caught was the first time I saw a phone go through a TV. She ordered a new one and apologized the next day for her reaction. I was on Christmas break and decided to smoke some with a couple friends. My mom thought it was because of the people I was hanging out with. It was quite the opposite: I liked to smoke and I had the money, so I bought the weed and was repaid in gas, munchies, and ways to pass the time. I also sold to another group in very small amounts (my biggest sale in high school was a quad) and was making my own decisions and such.

Today, my parents know that I smoke; but I haven't tried to show them the reasoning. They refuse to talk about it. Remember, a phone went through a TV. They don't call me out on it or cause trouble because I look and act like a functioning young adult, unlike my brother.  I work, I go to school, and I have ambition. 

My dad has told me several times about how he has been around people who smoked but never smoked with them. He said he isn't a fan of the smell, but I once saw his face light up in happiness over my mom picking up lunchmeat. His eyes were bright red and he had "the grin" so I'm convinced he has smoked before, and still might on the down low. I've smoked with a few of his close friends, so I know they're not too worried about it.

My mom is the opposite. She has never done a drug in her life recreationally (she keeps her Vyvanse locked in her cabinet and takes only the prescribed amount) except for cigarettes and caffeine, if you want to get anal about it. She is an ER nurse, and with that,  I understand why she is against drug use in general. She sees the worst outlooks on a daily basis: ODs, kids (15-19) losing out on a long life, just the generally crippling effects of being lost to an uncontrollable addiction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part 1.   

So at about 9 pm last night, I took a tab of acid, and let it do its work. The visuals weren't too intense but the feel goods and body vibes were beautiful. This lasted from roughly 10-1. I decided to have a smoke sesh, which created part 2 of the trip.    

Part 2.   

After this; I went into full trip mode, and laid in my backyard for 2 hours. It was dark, but the full moon made it look like it was daylight. Everything looked like it was a twilight time of day, and there was so much depth to the horizon. I could see designs and figures in the clouds. Weird enough, I saw 3 demonic faces staring into the moon, and I stared into it all. Once I could move, I entered one of the most intense and euphoric meditative trances in my life. I sat and I contemplated as much as I could, but I can only recall pieces at this time. I wound up falling asleep at sometime when my mind finally decided to give up from overload.

Rating.  

Part 1: ++ (I could still hold a full conversation with my mother)   

Part 2: +++ (I will not assign one of my own experiences as a ++++, but this is the closest I feel I have ever been to it) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mankind is made of the same building blocks as everything else we have discovered in our short history. Just a few basic molecules make up over 90% of the universe, yet there is so much diversity and beauty in our world. Life has found a place to flourish, amongst the rubble left from The Big Bang, and the results of the collisions of parts of said rubble. We are one planet, one pint sized, yet massive, grouping of molecular structures that has come together to create a collective life force&#8230;a drive, perhaps, to &#8220;advance&#8221; and &#8220;evolve&#8221; as numerous and diverse of species possible. It seems reasonable that there would be at least one other place in the universe that has this same capacity, and it utilizing it far better than any species on Earth would be able to compromise. We live in a universe that we have mapped a very small percentage of, said universe is constantly expanding, and we have already found at least one other collection of debris that has the possibility of being able to house some form of life. Scientists discovered that Mars used to have oceans, and that these oceans were found frozen under the surface of Mars itself. By extension, would it be fair to reason that Mars could have possibly housed lives before we as a species ever gained the collective power to be able to observe events that are beyond our planetary scale?
    
This understanding has helped me figure out some of the Nirvana and oneness that I felt during my last acid trip. I didn&#8217;t think of it the way I had typed it there during my trip, though. During, I felt myself sink into the ground, and fall into the Earth. When I had laid back down on my blanket, I felt myself floating up into the stars, and becoming the Hubble Space Telescope, in that every image I saw was clear, beautiful, mystifying, and vivid, yet I could process this through a computer so powerful and perplexingly fast that nothing man has done thus far has even come close to the processing speed and mind blowing capabilities of said computer. I&#8217;m talking about the human brain, of course.

<TEXT> I've noticed lately that I've become the source of drug related information for my friends (effects, dosage, and such) I figured it was because I try to explain things to the best of my abilities, going beyond "it'll get you fucked up." 

Does anyone else have a similar experience, and if so, tell me you use your position of knowledge responsibly? </TEXT>

Always enjoy yourself.

<TEXT> A friend of mine and I decided to make a tray of brownies and started cooking our weed. Everything was going great until we both left the kitchen, and wouldn't you know it, goddamn grease fire. I haven't seen the damage to the place yet, but he is currently in the ER with burns and such. 

If you're going to use vegetable oil or anything of the sort, be very observant and never leave it unattended.

Update: He has 3rd degree burns along his right wrist and right foot. Also; he is dealing with the pain like a champ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so I binged. I had 3/4 of an ounce of weed, a 750ml of Captain Morgan, 10 xanax, and some morphine. I smoked a few bong bowls, then took 4 MG of Xanax.

I now have an entire weekend at Muncie Gras that I have no memory of, all my xanax is gone, there's some kief in my bag, morphine is also gone and so is my memory for the last 2 days. Wow.

And I had to get my car out of impound. 

Edit: wound up being about 12 or 15 bars missing. What the fuck?

<TEXT> I have an undisclosed amount of money that was recently added to my bank account and about 3 days of down time before my new job starts. 

So, spending money is present, and time to recover is also present?

What should I binge on this weekend?

Edit: I have all my weed already purchased. I have about $400 I can spend. For the feeling, I want something where I can be social, and hyped up. Like I'm on top of the world without too much comedown. I don't need to feel lovey. 

Things I can get for sure: Xanax, various opiates (not touching H, personal preference) more weed, MDMA, shrooms, LSD, 25X series, Cocaine, Meth.

Anything else I should ask about? </TEXT>

1) Do so much of it that you show yourself moderation is the best way to handle it (me with drinking)

2) Don't ever carry anymore in your stash than you're willing to go through in 1 or 2 nights. Pre-plan dosages accordingly

3) Occupy your time with something else. When I'm saving something for the night,  I'll keep myself busy throughout the day. Doesn't have to be labor filled or stressful, just something.to occupy the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sleep has become episodic and comes only slightly; but always with weirdly vivid dreams that I can remember for about a half hour or so. Sometimes, my dreams will connect like short episodes of a mini series. 

Some of these involve drug use, and the substance will remain in my mind with an urge to do it for most of the next day. It changes based on dreams. My dream was that I was zoned out, alone, nodded with a glass pipe on the table, and no cares in the world. I may not always know what substance is in the dream, but I feel like I am altered in dream.

Drugs that have shown up: Weed, LSD, Molly, Crack, Meth, Peyote, Ayahusca, Cocaine, and one random dream about dying and being reincarnated on Ibogaine </TEXT>

Such was not the case, and my roommate asked if I was on drugs or something (anti-drug fellow) I also had a lofted bed at the time so I just told him I was drunk, grabbed my pillow and blanket off my bed and slept on the floor. So there's my fail.

<DATE> 2015-03-11 12:01:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last Wednesday, I did a .3 of MDMA and settled into listening to some music. I was enjoying myself, immersed in my peak, until I heard a loud knock on the door. I couldn't answer it since I would not have been able to hold a conversation. So, my parents wind up being forcefully woken up, and there was an officer at the door who brought my brother home. It turned out that he fell asleep at the wheel and ran off the road. I found out the next day that my brother blew a .05 and he had snorted 5 Loritab (his words) and then I told him my situation and how scared I was that there was a cop in my house while I was rolling. He laughed it off and was thankful he wasn't taken to jail. 

Now I ask, what drug experience led to your biggest anxiety attack? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worst stoner ever, The Intercept:   

Okay, so a group of about 4 of us rolled up a couple blunts to smoke around before watching some Blue Mountain State. Everything is about normal, until one of the other guys (Intercept) goes to get water. He comes back, and instead of sitting in his chair, he walks over, grabs the blunt out of rotation, calls it an "interception" and proceeds to hit it...and hit it....and hit it. I have not smoked with this friend since because that completely ruined the circle. Even if it wasn't my weed in the blunt (mine was in the other one) that's still a shitty move. After that, I grab my weed and blunt, and leave,  saying I had somewhere to be. I've seen him do this with hookahs as well, and no one calls him out on it. Nice guy, just...that moment left a bad vibe on my [6]

My other one is the Storyteller:   

This was a couple years ago. I had a bowl packed and going around, and it was smoked. Highness was felt. Then my friend at the time packed a bowl and passed it around. About midway through the second bowl, my friend starts telling a story, and goes on for about 15 minutes (I looked at my phone clock) without taking a hit or passing it. So, I ask whenever there is a break in the story if he is going to pass the bowl. His response went a little something like this: It's my fucking weed, don't be a mooching cock sucker, I'll tell a goddamn story if I fucking feel like it, and if you don't like it, then you take your dumbass home and don't bother me again. Other people were visibly bothered by his drawn out, retold stories, but I decided I'd be the one to nicely say something. As a result, I do not smoke with this friend. 


I noticed in general my smoking circle has shrunk a lot, but the people who hit me up for stuff is rising. Also I have no problem with people telling stories, it's just whenever you're story is drawn out and there is a perfectly good bowl not being touched by anyone because one person is holding up the circle. I understand finishing your thought then taking a hit, because that is how I tell stories when stoned.

<TEXT> I didn't know which sub to put this in but I need some help. I'm trying to form a Playlist so I have good music to listen to while I roll (MDMA) 

I'm sorry if this isn't helpful, but I prefer most genres except for pop twang (that modern country "music" stuff) 

Starting artists include:
Beck
Run the Jewels
Gojira
Kanye West
Jay Z
Datsik 
Skrillex

Edit; I am listening to every suggestion that is posted and I'm enjoying most of them </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is assuming all powers available and at max upgrades, all guns maxed out, the whole 9 yards.

Round 1: Is there anyone who can enter the simulated world and beat him, or is he like TOAA?   

Round 2: Outside the simulation and in powersuit.

I chose to not include a non powersuit, outside of simulation round because he is a regular human with guns otherwise.

Bonus: Would there be a tier change if followers were added?

Edit: Added in actual rounds and clarification </TEXT>

<TEXT> This winter has been my worst on cardio in a while. When I was in high school, I had sports, so cardio wasn't something I needed to conciously seek. I always had a gym buddy who would help talk me through actually getting on a treadmill or eliptical (I hate stationary cardio) and now that he moved further north, I've been slacking on cardio. I want to be able to run outside instead (easier on my knees) but whenever the average daily temperature is less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit, it gets too cold to run  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Tl:Dr. Alcoholic friend lectures me on doing coke once, fails to see hypocrisy in choices.

So last night, I went to hang out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while  (I transferred colleges). One of them had caught wind that I did coke within the past week, and gave me a huge lecture on how I'm not on the right path, how my life will be ruined, and all that jazz. I'm just venting a bit because I did it once (no redose, no urge to do it again) yet my friend is an alcoholic who will be drunk almost every day of the week  (they have about 20 empty handles of Fireball whiskey on display in their kitchen). One friend won't even acknowledge my presence anywhere anymore, and the third guy is cool, and knows I actually have my shit together. So yea, I hate word of mouth and the warped views of addiction people have. Yes, drugs can ruin your life. No, I don't believe you can be hooked on substances after one use.

Said friend is like "yeah, I chew, I drink, I even smoke pot on occassion, but that hard shit will ruin your life." Well, at least this friend has stopped being anti-marijuana

Edit: Removed some phrasing that made me come off worse than intended. 

2nd edit: The friend who wasn't acknowledging my presence has been a bit reserved about things lately, and I was told something else was probably on his mind. I feel like an ass. </TEXT>

One time, I went out to a club to go dance. Instead, I talked to people as they were coming in by the cover charge place (because I don't have a better name for it)

When I trip, I love anime. Something about Asian artwork entices me. The last time I tripped, I finished watching the arc of Hajime No Ippo I was on, and getting caught up on season 3 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't seen as much use out of women personally. Most of them I know tend to just drink with their friends, and maybe a quarter of that group will smoke on occassion. I think it's like 5 or 6, at the most, that I know for a fact they have done something more recreational  (MDMA, LSD, shrooms)
    
Almost every guy I know drinks or smokes. A decent amount have done coke, shrooms, acid, what have you. I can find a guy to be a safety, or to do the substance with me, much easier than I can a woman.
    
Though I have seen more women be around prescription pills than men. </TEXT>

2. This is basically Ted vs JD, since Marshall and Turk were basically married/engaged throughout the whole series. And they would both say the wrong thing at the wrong time.

3. This isn't a serious question. JD and Turk have the best bromance in series, and they even show up in each other's AMAs </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still work across from one. Sometimes their music seeps across, past the phone kiosk in the middle where the ladies working there have a Macbook on loud blaring Drake, past the speakers we have blaring Rush, Led Zeppelin, and other classics, and into my unfortunate ears. 

One girl I know and am friends with will claim that Bring me the Horizon is better than anything I listen to. Sure I've gone through phases of shitty music tastes, but this is worse than what I used to listen to. I will list my musical experiences in a different comment if anyone is interested, so they can see my frame of reference.

That last paragraph was intended to sound incredibly pretentious.  </TEXT>

Weed: This world is too serious, sometimes. I unwind after the competition and rush of everyday life. 

Benzos: Rare, but usually only when I need something done or my social retardation goes into overdrive.

Psychedelics: I like to see things from a different point of view, especially when it is something through my own senses.

Mdma: When I want to party and enjoy myself, but I don't want to drink. Better than alcohol honestly, just less socially acceptable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple favorites actually.

Snoop Dogg: creates peaceful hip hop, moves to reggae, smoking weed the whole time. Then, he develops edgier music that culminates into songs about smoking, and a general disregard for the law. Point: dudes still smoking weed either way.

Behemoth: multiple lineup changes, lead singer gets and ungets leukemia, and the music is still metal as fuck either way. Mostly the same back and forth for me.

I love the look of my eyes when i'm on certain substances,  but I wish I could find things to do that either wouldn't make my eyes extremely bloodshot or make my pupils dilate to the size of dimes.

Marijuana = bloodshot, 'lowered' eyes 
MDMA/Molly/MDA = Dilated eyes
25i/25c = Dilated eyes
Cocaine = Dilated eyes
Alcohol = I don't look at my eyes when I'm  drunk.
LSD = Dilated Eyes
Adderall = Dilated eyes
Benzos = I don't fuck with em much. I have an addictive personality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Context: I tripped with a couple of friends last night, but I left because some others in the group were trying to get me to buy weed so they could smoke it. I had another friend come pick me up to be my safety. I couldn't explain to him what kind of vibe I was looking for (words were hard) and he tried his hardest to set up a good vibe. So I wound up watching Deadman Wonderland and taking breaks to look into the mirror. Basically, I had an awesome trip, but but I wish I could let people know how to be the best safeties they can be.

Edit: Safeties = Trip Sitters  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a matter of preptime. I've heard and seen they are both ridiculous at it (beware of circle jerkers). 

Round 1: both get a week of preptime to figure out how to appease the hunger of Galactus.

Round 2: both get 6 months to figure out how to take down a higher tiered member of a different universe. (Loki vs Superman, Batman vs Thor)

Round 3: both get 5 years to prepare a contingency for something that they should not/cannot do by themselves. Situations are Loki vs Darkseid and Batman vs Thanos.

Bonus 1: The two fight to incap, no prep. (Bats doesn't kill in character)

Bonus 2: one month prep, fight to kill (bloodlusted) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anecdotal evidence follows: 
Marijuana can provide a psychological dependence, rather than a physical one (like, you will mentally crave it rather than physically) and this can be just as addictive and difficult to break as a physical dependence. One of the biggest signs to determine if someone is addicted to marijuana is to check their spending habits. If they are sacrificing necessities for weed, then you have an addict on your hands.

Man of Tai Chi was a pretty good movie to watch (not top 5 or anything) but it is a great martial arts film still that is packed with action and elegance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can anyone answer why they went with Scott Lang as their Ant Man of choice instead of Hank Pym? Don't get me wrong, I like my lovable 80s comic characters, but I feel like Pym would be able to be a more consistent parallel between what has happened in the original Marvel Universe (616) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Edit: according to several people, Pym will be appearing in the Ant Man movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I head into Meps this Wednesday and Thursday,  but I know I will be put on a DEP because of my braces, so the earliest I could go to basic would be late February - early March. My main questions are: 
What should I look for in my contract (loans being paid back, school being paid for, mos, rank, etc)?
How much of what my recruiters push is complete bullshit (they aren't focused on me getting an education, but rather they keep trying to push the possible high salary that can come with being a nuclear engineer?
And what would happen If I decided to not sign my contract after passing all my physical and mental requirements (I can pass tape and am likely to get a near perfect score on the ASVAB)? </TEXT>

That is the cry of Star Platinum trying as hard as he can to protect Jotaro from the swarm. I want to believe that with the power of precise movements and the urges of Stand master preservation,  Star Platinum would fend off all the bees, but I do not think he could move fast enough to protect Jotaro from a swarm of the bees stinging him. Maybe they could do the heart stop thing to prevent blood flow so the venom doesn't circulate while it gets separated from the blood cells and removed from the body,  but I doubt that would even work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally, the chapters that haze are becoming more and more of the minority amongst Greek Life as a whole. Honestly, there are other ways of building the bonds between members that will last a lifetime. Personally, spending time around all of my fellow brothers doing things like catching dinner or even hanging out playing Xbox (not stereotypical CoD or sports) makes me feel like we are all connected beyond our memberships in our respective chapters. 

I do not have any hazing experiences myself, as I'm not big on hazing people, and there wasn't really any type of initiation requirement or anything of that sort that could be considered hazing, within the wordings of both public perception and our National Fraternal Constitution.

<TEXT> Alucard (Hellsing) vs Wolverine (Marvel)

1. In character, both of them would likely fight, since Wolverine as a mutant would likely be someone Alucard would hunt. I feel like most rounds would be a contest of Alucard's souls vs Wolverine's healing factor. I would give the victory to Alucard's souls and vamperic powers. Alucard 6.5/10

2. Bloodlusted: if Wolverine can chop off Alucard's head and rip out his heart on a speedblitz, then Wolverine would win (odds are about 4/10, IMO) More than likely, Alucard would go level 0 and Wolverine's healing factor would not be able to keep up with the sheer amount of injuries he would suffer. Alucard 6/10.

3. Prep: Wolverine would know what to do to actually kill Alucard, and Alucard would know how to beat adamantium skeletons and healing factor, but I would give this to Wolverine 6/10, because I think prep helps Wolverine more than it would Alucard </TEXT>

<TITLE> SSJ3 Goku vs Majin Vegeta </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes, this has probably been done before, so if there are previous threads discussing my idea, by all means, link me to them.

My thought is that Goku would only have about half an hour or so on Earth in SS3 and he can't hold the form for too long. Would he be able to defeat Majin Vegeta in such a short time span (something like 7 or 8 minutes) using SS3,  given their fighting styles and knowledge of each other? Defeat here meaning incap, since Goku wouldn't kill Vegeta at this point in DBZ.

If Goku cannot defeat Vegeta in that short time span, then allow Goku the full hour or however long he would be allowed on Earth in SS3 for the fight.

If it is a total stomp, well, I can't think of a good thing that would help Vegeta that is also in the DB universe at the moment.

Edit: how do I add a flair or whatever for frequently used characters,  because I know these two see a lot of time on this thread (not necessarily against each other though) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alucard. One of the few stomp cards I dislike playing, for the most part.

He stomps rounds 1-5 easy enough, because if you kill him, he just comes right back. 
No wait, include round 6...He shoots Jake and eats Finn.
Round 7- The Lich: I give this to Alucard 7/10, depending on whether he unlocks control level 0, or he stays at control level 1.

For those who don't know: level 0 us basically where he unleashes the army comprised of everyone he has ever killed/consumed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Batman can learn the situation and everything a lot easier than Barney so yeah...Batman wins round 1.

2. Barney would obviously be funnier, given his track record when it comes to dealing with criminals and whatnot.

3. How fucked is Gotham? Very. There is no way Fife can deal with any level of criminal if he isn't hardly able to deal with the people of Mayberry doing little things here and there. He would be a comedy character in a not so comedic world.

4. There would be no crime in Mayberry because Batman would either have everyone locked up, or he would have struck fear into their hearts. For a recall election,  that would likely never happen seeing how the master detective can deduce the situation (see #1) easily enough to win the affection of Mayberry and its citizens.

<TEXT> Bender would get too lazy to fight,  more than likely. Remember that he isn't motivated go do much of anything,  unless it is for him. 

The Joker could probably use Bender's alcohol dependency to lure him into some kind of trap related to vaporizing Bender or making robots obsolete. 

Overall, I would say Bender at 7.5/10 because he would recognize when he is being conned, and he is also a frickin robot, so he would likely use any of the million or so things he's pulled out of his body/ass to kill the Joker.

Thought: in the episode of Futurama where the electromagnetic cosmic abnormality opens, Bender literally shits bricks as an act of fear. So he could be scared, shit bricks, and then kill Joker with those. 

Crime: They'd probably rob a super sized bank, and then Joker would burn the money because he is fuckin insane. </TEXT>

Is that one of those things that is just my personal taste, or is there something that makes people tend to like an artists earlier work?

Edit: My grammar and syntax are pretty shitty, but I don't plan on perfecting it, just so grammar nazis know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen everything from support to indifference to comparing having gay pride/being gay to enjoying rape and murder. If it effects locker room chemistry, then that's bad. If it doesn't, then why does this need to be a big deal. Being gay doesn't mean he is suddenly going to lose his talents in football.

Edit: I am pretty sure that I meant to use affect instead of effect, but I am not absolutely sure on that </TEXT>

<TEXT> This guy really got gold? He didn't make any type of argument or give any kind of details.

I guess I really appealed to someone's emotions then. Because yea, I didn't type that comment out to divulge into some great opinion with an at length argument backing my views.

Also, I would give you gold for posting that response, except I am on mobile. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, the lineup for Spring Awakening 2014 has been posted, and it is looking like it is going to be a very strong lineup. I would like to hear everyone elses' comments on the subject, such as, if you are going to attend, which artist or artists you are looking forward to most. This concert is in Chicago, Illinois for anyone interested.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-spring-awakening-lineup-20140203,0,2068299.column

There is a link I provided highlighting the lineup, including headlining sets by KasKade, Pretty Lights, and Tiesto. I am personally looking forward to Tiesto. </TEXT>
