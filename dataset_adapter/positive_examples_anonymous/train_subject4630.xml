<TITLE> What should I do with my life? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-16 05:46:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sitting here at college orientation, and we're scheduling tomorrow. I'm very nervous, mainly because it's my future I'm beginning to decide on (I know I always have the option to change it). Being an actuary has always appealed to me, but I've got so many concerns, and I was wondering if you had any thoughts on them. Will I have time for a family? A social life? Will this take over my life?

Edit: does anyone have any actual advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're just square Hanover (Snyder's) pretzels, mint Hershey's kisses and m  ms. Place the pretzels on a cookie tray, put in oven at 400 f for about 2:00. You have to watch them really carefully, or they'll melt too much. Take them out as soon as you can partially push an mm onto the top, and then push mms onto all of them. Put in the refrigerator and they're good to go. I'm just proud because it's so hard for me to get out of bed, let alone make something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Paranoid - they drape my weary cries, exclamations of an educated mind, in exquisite explanations, intent on restricting my elementary observations. I lash at their less than subtle attempts at relaying these lies, tarnishing their own word, with each expression of good enduring. They put me in the well, a wash of white flashing as my mind thrashes through their poison. They tell me I am not, for the world, to be trusted; that I should game my already-adaptive intellect by associating with their filthy dances. They are all around me; again, I cry, they will not stop speaking. I see them fly, they can see my every move, here my thoughts! I must retreat, my thought has fallen, swooping around me, they invade; what do they want from me? I cannot traverse my head without encountering their trespass! "Oh God," I exclaim, and refuse to yield. They will find my corpse before they control that which I hold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, from what I've seen, most of us seem to suffer from extreme heartbreak. I was thinking about the girl I love yesterday and thought of a lyric in pearl jam's song Black. He says "I know you're going to be a star in someone else's sky, but why, why can't it be mine"

So I started thinking... The lead singer of pearl jam had someone to lament over. I have someone to lament over. How many people have someone to lament over?

And the thing that comforted me was just the realization that this person I wanted so much ... There's thousands of them. Everyone has one, it seems. 

Suddenly she seemed less special </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to spend hours on the Internet looking at photos
Trying to find ones that illustrated the feelings that I never could
I didn't really know what love was,
Because I hadn't really felt it yet
So everyday I just focused on me
My head
Me
But it wasn't me
And no matter how hard I tried
It's so hard, 
I couldn't be happy on my birthday
And I really
Really
Wanted to be happy on my moms
Birthday
But see, I'm not allowed to be happy when I should be
And definitely not allowed to cry when I'm sad
And when everything's going wrong
And I shouldn't continue
The hypo mania feels glorious
Every thought is an epiphany unto the source of pure joy
The most painful feeling I've ever felt has to be when I realize I should be crying and I can't

Not being in control of my emotions makes it really hard to interact with people
It was really hard to be friends with me
When you never know who I might be at the time
But you
You
I met you
And for the first time in a long time
As long as I can remember
I felt, deep inside, like I was me.
And any time I didn't show up for school
You called me
And as we got to know each other, I focused on your eyes
You were so beautiful
And as hard as my mind tried,
It wasn't able to fuck with me any more
Because for once, I was able to be happy when I should be
You have no idea how that felt
It was love
And it was outside the bounds of my head which I had been living in for so long
But you didn't know why it meant so much
So much more than it should have
Than I looked like
And when I came over to your house every day for weeks, even when you didn't want me to
You didn't know that it was me coming over
And not my mind
And that separation was glorious
And so you got scared
And told me I shouldn't come over so much
What you didn't know was that I couldn't be me without you
I couldn't be me without you
I couldn't be me without you
And so my friends told me to cut ties with you
That I shouldn't live off of you
That you couldn't breath life into me if you only did it when you felt like it
So I did
I left
And now
I spend a lot of time on the Internet
Searching for something that might allow me to feel me again
And now that every day is a day I should be crying
Every day is a painful day
Because I can't
And no one calls me
When I don't show up for school

<TEXT> I fell in love. With a girl around Christmas. She left me for her abusive ex. My friends left me when I needed them to be there for me. I just met a girl who seemed like she was someone who wouldn't hurt me. We've been dating for a few weeks now, and were supposed to go out tonight but she asked if it was alright if she went on a girls night. I said of course. I went out with a friend of mine, not really a friend, but company, and guess what. She was there with a guy, alone. On a date. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every time, I meet someone whom I trust completely, and I give myself to them. I cannot find a single person on this world who would do the same for me. They ALL have somebody. No one is truly alone. And if that's true than there's no one for me. I just can't do it anymore, my heart will never heal. It's been too long. I guess I'm just posting here to hear what you have to say, but I guarantee you're not alone. You have someone. If you don't, meet me, then someone who's not me, but more important than me, will show up.

<TEXT> I spent five months falling in love with a girl who said she loved me back, but was never there for me. I ignored the fact that I was never an important part of her life, and she stabbed me in the back more times than I can count. Three weeks ago I told her I was having an episode, she's helped me with depression, and she said we weren't good for each other as friends. (Not quite sure where the connection between the two comes from). Anyway, I've been miserable for three weeks, I deleted her number, but this morning I saw posts on Facebook that she's in a relationship with a guy I know and hate, and they were chatting back and forth and I've been crying ever since. I've dealt with depression long before I met her, but these three weeks and today are crushing me. I just need someone to tell me what to do so I feel better, because with depression, it's like every day makes me reach the limit of things I can handle. I can't handle this too :(

<TEXT> So today I've been working on a final paper, and I decided to work on leveling up. What I did was go into infection, and find the best hiding spot you can. Leave your guy there, because (I think) this is the only gametype where you WON'T be kicked for not moving! I've gained 200,000 xp in the past few hours just by looking up at the end of every game. 

NOTE: This is for gaining XP when you're doing something else, like working on a final! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's one of the most ignorant things I've ever heard. "Jeez, why'd that girl commit suicide from cyber bullying??? She wasnt REALLy persecuted, I mean, come on!"

If you are going to go down the list of what constitutes persecution, I find that over 3000 people getting together and making fun of my beliefs constitutes persecution. The def. of that word is to be subject to hostility. I don't think anyone can judge what someone feels, and if they are feel they are persecuted. To clarify, please don't take this hostilely. What I am trying to say is that it is in the eye of the beholder in terms of who decides if they're persecuted. If I go on r/atheism and see [this](http://i.imgur.com/hcBQP.jpg) , feel very persecuted. We should respect all and everyone's opinion, because if we don't, then who can respect ours? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were to men working out in the hot sun digging a ditch. Their boss is a little ways away sitting under a tree reading. One digger says to the other, "Why do we have to work while he relaxes?"

The other says, "I don't know. I'll go ask."

So he gets out of the ditch and goes and asks his boss, "Why do you relax while we work?"

The boss says, "Well, am farther up in this company."

To this, the digger replies, "Why do you get to be higher up?"

So, the boss says, "I have more common sense then you."

"what's that?"

The boss then proceeds to place his hand on the tree and say, "Hit my hand as hard as you can."

So the digger does, but the boss moves his hand and the digger hits the tree.

Walking back to the ditch, confused and rubbing his sore knuckles, he hops down and the other digger asks him why they have to work while the boss gets to relax.

The man says, "He has more common sense."

"What's that?"

So, to demonstrate, the man puts his hand on his face and says, "Hit me with that shovel as hard as you can." </TEXT>

<TEXT> eighth grade, I had this old woman in her 70's who taught philosophy. The class consisted of her lecturing for an hour and a half (she used to be a college prof.) and everyone playing games and sleeping. I usually tried to pay attention, but it was on and off.
   One day she decided to have a "philosophical" discussion, I forget what it was about. Anyway, I had an opinion that differed from the rest of the class and her (mainly because it was the only one she had taught them) so I took my side and tried to explain it. After some back and forth, she looks to the class and says "I know not all of you are as stupid as him; does anyone know the right way to think about this?" 
   And of course nobody raised their hand because they had no idea what we were talking about, but it still made me feel pretty bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How did you first get involved with clans in general?
I googled CoD clans, picked one that sounded interesting to me
How did you get into the current clan you participate in?
Last one broke up, I migrated with some members
What are the benefits of being involved with your clan?
Mw3 is terrible to play by yourself, we're a strictly "for fun" clan so it lets you play with people you know.
Has it created a community/friendships for you?
Yeah, definitely. We communicate and help each other out, joke around, and practically spend every night shouting at each other (In a good way. ish, lol)
Do you know anyone from the clan outside of xbox live?
no
If so, how?
nope
What is the goal of playing with a clan?
fun and playing with people you know
 . What methods do you use to set up matches?
Just whoevers online joins a lobby/party
Do you see a competitive future for your group?
Not at all
How do you stay in touch with fellow clan members?
Just whoevers online, party chat.

Clan name's Rise Against Gaming, changed from Soldiers of Desolation (SoD). Good luck with your project </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>    So there's this girl I talk to once in a while, same friend group as me. However, according to some of her friends, and her obvious actions, she has a crush on me (Yay not foreveralone!) I'm not opposed to anything possibly happening between us, however, every time we have a conversation, she makes it super duper awkward. Like, if I say I like something, she'll make a big deal about liking it too... and then it dissipates into silence. Any advice on making the situation more comfortable?

P.S. if any of you spell awkward wrong, I will cry. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past several years, I've been a straight A student. I went to high school three years early by moving to a city that had a program that allowed me to do that. I've always had a pretty good work ethic. For the past couple months, though, I've been having difficulty maintaing my school work. I've done literally no work outside of class. I scrape by by making up lies and turing stuff in late. Is there any way to get back into a system where I can get motivated? It's gotten so bad I spent more time on reddit writting this post then I did on my eight page history paper due... 1st block tomorrow. Any help would be great.

EDIT: I was diagnosed with depression a year ago, and it's been downhill ever since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've shouted that exact same phrase at my friends, lol "This is game frustration, chill out" if they get mad in real life. I think it's a sign that you're getting into the game. Of course, it can evolve into real life frustration, but I think a healthy array of emotions is good for gaming. Getting "game frustrated" relieves anger in real life for me, and makes the game that much more captivating. </TEXT>
