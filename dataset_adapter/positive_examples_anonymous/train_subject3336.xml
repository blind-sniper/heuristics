<TEXT> I'm sorry you feel that way. The article was meant to open debate (hence the question of the header) and so far I'd say it's been pretty successful. Doesn't mean we have to agree. But my points are pretty concise and my opinion comes across well enough for many other's to have contacted me and discuss it. There's no need to be disrespectful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well this is exactly what I explore in the article. Is society partly to blame, especially among young people and do we need to start taking responsibly for how the media portrays women? Personally I don't think it's a simple yes or no answer as there are many factors, this article focuses on one of those aspects. Thank you for your comment :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course if you only read this post I would totally agree with you. Having had depression, and as you noticed my suicide attempt video I also self-harmed as a teen and now have anxiety and generally I did suffer badly from mental illness. What this post questions is could it partly stem from the way society views women. Thank you for reading xx </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah well thanks for the super lovely and positive comment. I am actually trying to help people who maybe felt like I did back then and believe it or not many say I have helped them. Don't like it, don't read it.

Oh and I'm not a teen - I'm 30 years old and no longer suffer from mental illness. But who are you to say teen angst isn't a gateway to more serious problems? It is exactly because of attitudes like this that people are afraid to speak out about how they feel so thank you for proving the point of my 'whiny' blog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so sorry you are suffering this way :( I have anxiety but mildly in comparison to what I used to have. Best thing I ever did was find a good councillor and find out WHY I was depressed and anxious. Knowing why stopped the self harming and the destructive behaviour as a result of learning to love myself. Sending strength and love x </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help Me End The Stigma Of Mental Illness! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-04 12:18:07 </DATE>

<TEXT> Hey all :) I have suffered with some serious mental health issues including self harm, bulimia, [suicide attempts](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/i-survived/) and general depression and anxiety.

A few years ago I decided I no longer wanted to be a victim of my mind - of my experiences - and so I started using [various tools and techniques](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com/category/intrusiveobsessive-thoughts-and-rumination/how-to-get-rid-of-intrusive-or-obsessive-thoughts) to start [taking back control](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com/category/quietening-the-mind) of my life. 

I also started telling people my story. It was amazing to me how many people would open up about their experiences once they saw how open I was about mine. I learned very quickly that nearly everyone has a connection with mental health, be it personally, with a friend or with a family member

3 months ago I launched my blog [The Unmarked Road](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com), in an attempt to continue to speak openly about my experiences, and to give hope and strength to those struggling in the way that I did.

I want people to stop feeling ashamed over their difficult emotions and to realise the inner power that they have within them to change what can sometimes feel like an inevitable future; a future dominated by mental illness and a lack of control over their destiny.

I would love for people to visit my site (of course :) ) but more than that I would love you to have a look and see how [my blog](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com) could be improved. How together we can take on the stigma that still surrounds mental illness.

Thank you for taking the time to have a look.

<TEXT> Hi :)

It is awful to feel 'not normal'. I don't ever remember feeling anything other than a freak for a long time. Self-harming was just one of many ways that I 'coped' with the storm inside my head.

But I have spent 5 years learning ways of dealing in a healthy way. I never engage in harmful behaviour to cope with stress anymore...wow just saying that makes me feel somehow amazed at how different I was to back then; back when I drank, occasionally took drugs, binged and purged on food and self-harmed. I never once now have the urge to engage in any harmful behaviour (the worst I do now is eat a whole pizza to myself followed by a mountain of ice-cream - bit again that isn't to punish myself so it isn't the same thing). 

So why is I have not got any desire to 'give in' to addictions? Because I learned to love myself. I love myself too much to disrespect myself in such a way. I know I deserve to be happy. And that lesson is probably the most important of anyone's life.

The tools that helped me vary from self-affirmations to meditation (no I'm not a crazy hippy, I promise ;)).

People do care, but they don't know how to deal with uncomfortable things. There is too much stigma surrounding it. I am trying to raise awareness and now try to help people that go through similar things that I survived. That's how I see it. I survived. If you'd like to speak in more detail please feel free to ask :) xx </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi :)

Firstly, you're already doing so much by not judging her! Take it from a survivor of self-harm; being made to feel ashamed is incredibly debilitating and worsens the problem.

Self-harm is a way of coping. I don't know if she'll be able to relate, but for me it was a way of stopping the chaos that was in my head. The physical pain was the only thing that beat the emotional pain...at least for a while.

As I said, I'm a survivor. I have gone from doing it almost weekly, to now being free of it for over 8 years. I help and support people going through these things, so please let me know if you would like to talk to me more about it. 

Sending you both strength and love  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great little post and yes, we are not our anxiety! :)

I suffer with anxiety...and have suffered with depression, bulimia, self-harm. My greatest achievement to date is setting up my new blog called [The Unmarked Road](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com) which aims to support people currently struggling with similar issues and helping people see that there is hope and a chance to live a normal life.

<TEXT> Hi Jkwazz. I'm sorry to hear you are struggling. When I came off anti-depressants, I had the worst withdrawal, even though the doctors said you can't get withdrawal from these particular drugs. I am not from the US so I can't help in that respect, but I thought I would message you anyway incase you needed someone to talk to. I have a blog called The Unmarked Road in which I talk about y experiences with depression, anxiety and a whole heap of other stuff. You can contact me privately through it at www.theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com if you need some support.

<TEXT> Ambiguous header but true. I've survived suicide attempts (both my own and that of family members), self-harm, domestic abuse of a parent, depression, anxiety, bulimia and more.

I remember feeling so alone and like a freak for being different to everybody else. I founded The Unmarked Road to share my story, in hope it gives comfort to those going through hard times and struggling with their thoughts and emotions.

**Your past does not have to define your future.**

No matter how dark things appear, there is always a light. I know this because I have come out the other side of some of the deepest depth of despair imaginable. 

Through sharing our experiences, we can end the stigma of mental health together. I welcome all of you to share your stories with me.

Dani xx
