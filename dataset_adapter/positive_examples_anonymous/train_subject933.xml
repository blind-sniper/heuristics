I think human accomplishments can have long term meaning. There have been plenty of negative decisions that have impacted people for centuries

I think we are souls

Yes, I definitely believe so. 

That's an interesting question that I've never considered before. I immediately thought about plants. I would say that any organism that is living and breathing has a soul  </TEXT>

*I don't want to be viewed as the crazy, unstable guy
*I also don't want to be pitied

I have mommy and daddy issues. I believe parents have three main responsibilities to their children: physical nourishment, financial security, and emotional support. My parents both emotionally abandoned me as a child. They clearly stated that they wanted nothing to do with me in an emotional sense. My parents also gaslight me among other things. 

My mommy issues cause me to subconsciously choose girls that are like my mother. I often choose girls who are too controlling or who do not reciprocate my love and affection.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing about OCD is that in may start in one form of obsessions but move to another. 

Recently, I have experienced homosexual obsessions and have this deep rooted fear that I might be gay because I have never tried being gay. I've been heterosexual my whole life. 

I know how it feels and I can truly say that it is awful. You begin to question your reality and wonder if what you know about yourself is true.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Earlier this week, there was a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/3aij3n/what_do_you_think_women_should_try_so_that_they/csd3zki) about what women should try in order to understand men better. I responded to this thread by stating that women should try being judged for crying in public. An interesting response lead me to ask this question. 

When was the last time you found yourself to the point of tears in a public place? Also, do you feel that you face more judgment as a man for crying? Or do you feel as if the judgment would be equal if you were a woman crying in public?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think one thing to consider is the factor of emotional abuse that is occurring within this situation. 

There is a term called gaslighting in which the abuser tries to control the victim's memory by committing actions and convincing the victim that they never happened. Your brother seems to be doing this and your family seems to be assisting him in this. 

You are seeking validation. You want what happened to be acknowledged and validated; this is only fair. However, if they refuse to validate these things, you can only do two things: stay in the situation or remove yourself from it. The deciding factor will be if the lack of validation will be detrimental to your recovery.

<TEXT> The hardest part for me is how society invalidates the emotional abuse of men by refusing to acknowledge it as abuse. No one directly calls this type of behavior as abuse. People will say "oh, she is just crazy". Men will say "oh, my girlfriend freaks out on me". Men are not allowed to say "my girlfriend emotionally abuses me". However, if a man were to exhibit the same behavior, people would easily validate that the woman or SO is being abused. 

There are many reasons for this. Some people believe that men cannot be abused because of some ancient gender expectations. Also, there are some men that will have a difficult time validating the fact that they are being abused. 

I normally don't talk about the abusive relationships I have been involved in because no one will believe me. The hardest part about dealing with this type of pain is when someone invalidates a traumatic experience.  </TEXT>

I know schizophrenia has to do with a loss of touch to reality. From your post, it seems as if there was no logical connection to you having those thoughts; that makes it seem like a loss of touch to reality. However, that's just my observation and I could definitely be wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not proud to say this, but I've been in two. Abuse manifests itself in patterns, therefore, there is always another reason why a person easily accepts abuse. 

I would often make excuses for her behavior (e.g. she is just having a bad day, I made her upset, she had a rough childhood). However, none of these things are acceptable excuses for abusive behavior. 

The sad part about this is that he has to realize the abuse in his own mind. Once he acknowledges the abusive behavior, then he will begin to do something. The enlightenment is the hardest part.

<TEXT> I will probably take some of my weaknesses to my grave. That may be sad but it is honest. I definitely cannot show how sensitive I am or when I'm hurt.

<TEXT> I think the bigger issue is society's definition of masculinity versus authentic masculinity. In other words, society often expects men to be unhuman. Men are real people and some of those people have illnesses. However, society has a hard time grasping the concept that men have emotional needs. 

Ultimately, mental health issues do not make a person weak and until society grasps this concept men will continue to suffer in silence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> An abusive relationship is similar to traveling deep in the ocean. You start to become lost in your own world, therefore, you begin to rationalize things. 

I would often make excuses for her behavior: "She didn't mean it this time, she was just having a bad day, she's not like this all of the time". 

It does not matter what your friends and family tell you; also, chances are she has isolated you from their reach. You begin to sink deeper and deeper in this ocean until you suffocate. You either realize what's going on or you're stuck.  </TEXT>

Take a moment to look at the responses from this thread a few months back that asked men to share who was the last person who held them when they cried. Many of the answers are their mother during their childhood. This is unacceptable. 

Until society, including other men and women, learn to validate men's emotions, we will continue to have the mental health struggles. Men are humans, too.  </TEXT>

From your comment reply, you said this as if some women feel as if they must sacrifice to please their partner. All relationships have sacrifices. However, I was forced to sacrifice for my emotional safety. That type of sacrifice is never okay in any relationship. 

No one should have to fear the consequences if they want to say no to sex. And I did.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I told myself I wasn't going to tell this story in fear that my ex would find my Reddit account, but I will not allow her to run my life. 

My ex girlfriend and I decided not to engage in sexual activity until we were married. I had my beliefs and values about sex. However, I always felt the pressure from her to do whatever I could not consider sexual intercourse. 

One night, she was staying the night at my place and we start making out. Clothes start to come off and at this point, I knew we were close to the heat of the moment. I also knew my values and I did not want to go further than those. However, there was always some sort of emotional consequence if I didn't do something she wanted. She would criticize me by saying I was either being selfish or too passive or not manly enough. There was one occurrence when she started crying because I wasn't being sexual enough with her. 

So, I knew I had to do something to please her. I had to give up my body or face her criticism. So, we do some sexual things. The body doesn't lie though. I did not even become aroused. She thought it was because I didn't like her. I knew that I had to either do what she wanted or face some emotional punishment. As soon as it was over, I laid on my side of the bed and felt so helpless. I have never felt so powerless. 

And that was how I was sexually coerced. It fucked me up pretty bad and it still haunts me to this day to know that she had that much power over my body.

<TEXT> I think everyone struggles with confidence at some point in their lives. No matter how many compliments I receive, I still have my moments of insecurity. 

Ultimately, I think in order to love yourself you need to know yourself. Figure out what you enjoy and what you don't enjoy. You can love yourself by being around people you enjoy and doing things that you enjoy. 

OP, how well do you know yourself? </TEXT>

I will say that once your relationship progresses into something more serious, family matters become a little more important. That's if you strongly value family.

<TEXT> I just was forced out of my OCD closet last week. There are plenty of people that I have not told. There are plenty of people that I will probably never tell about my OCD. 

I hid it from my family and closest friends for four years. Mainly, I thought I was schizophrenic instead of an OCD sufferer. However, I eventually found the courage to tell a friend. 

This is my advice to you: everyone does not need to know. Don't be ashamed of it, but also know that you are taking a risk if you choose to place yourself on public display for OCD. Also, know that there are people who understand. You will meet plenty of people who simply do not understand.  </TEXT>

* 1) Strawberry Swing
* 2) Swallowed in the Sea
* 3) X Y
* 4) See You Soon
* 5) Yellow
* 6) Trouble
* 7) Amsterdam

Not to say that their younger works were immature, but I think AROBTTH is full of young energy. Ghost Stories seemed as if they mellowed out a bit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not an activist but I definitely do support Men's Rights. Similar to the way that I support Women's Rights. I think everyone should have rights. Does that make me an egalitarian? Maybe. 

Both groups definitely have extremists: MRA has misogynists and Feminisms has the "I drink male tears" women. However, neither of these define the group. My issue is when people identify with the group without fully understanding the movement. For example, most women who people would call "feminazis" do not realize that feminism advocates for equal rights for men, too. 

Ultimately, I consider myself a supporter of Men's Rights, but not an activist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After reading the comments in this thread, I noticed that most people have commented about mothers who were overbearing or manipulative. However, what about mothers who walked out on their sons or who are negligent? 

I have a habit of choosing women who are similar to my mother or father; I don't have a good relationship with either of them. I love my mum but she was not there for me, emotionally. Consequently, I tend to choose girls who are emotionally absent. However, I will agree that approval seeking is a big piece of this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just started talking to people about my feelings within the past two years. Most people don't know I have depression because I severely mask my feelings. My best friend believes I've been depressed for years, but she never said anything. Anyways, here is the problem. 

I've been diagnosed with OCD, but I've also been diagnosed with clinical depression. I feel as if I'm sinking into this pit of quicksand and I cannot do anything to stop it. 

* I go to counseling, but I don't feel as if I'm getting anywhere
* My sleep is becoming progressively worse
* I'm extremely exhausted all of the time. I have huge bags under my eyes, so I'm surprised no one has noticed. 
* Constant headaches
* I have zero focus, which is bad because I'm in grad school
* I don't have a strong support system 
* I'm starting to feel like a burden to the friends who know about my depression 

Ultimately, I feel as if there is nothing I can do to help myself. 
Suggestions or advice?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When my OCD first started, it began with scrupulosity. I believed that my soul was under attack by the devil. I also believed that my intrusive thoughts were demons. In order to fight this, I believed my compulsions were my method to fight these demons. I also believed that demons were trying to possess me, I had missed the rapture, and I was fighting this religious war. 

Thinking retrospectively, I am pretty sure I was delusional. 

Has anyone with OCD had any similar experiences with delusions or hallucinations? If so, could you tell me a little about your experiences? I have started to do research and I would love to hear about your stories.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not proud of this, but I have been in two emotionally abusive relationships. 

Emotionally abusive people are not completely bad or good; this is the reason it's hard to recognize the abuse at first. In my experience, my ex girlfriends were very manipulative and controlling. I felt as if I was trapped. There was nothing I could do that was right. I was always the blame. I had to walk on eggshells and try not to piss her off, or else I would be punished. I could not even voice my opinion or try to stand up for myself because she would claim that I was emotionally attacking her. I felt helpless.  

Both times, I ended the relationship because I could not take anymore. I tried to give them a chance, hoping that they would change. They did not. Emotional abuse really damages a person, years afterwards. Counseling helps, though. The best way to make it right is to acknowledge what you have done and apologize. I will never receive an apology from either ex, because they truly don't believe they have done anything wrong.  </TEXT>

[articles](http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140620/ARTICLES/140629975) that provided evidence. You are right with the comment that the Duluth model focuses "on a female centric idea of abuse". That is where the main logic in innocent arrests is born. Police are trained to believe that men are always in the wrong, even when the police do not have have sufficient evidence.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I normally don't talk about this because I seem to be surrounded by radical feminists, however, I am a supporter of the Mens Right Activist Movement. I think, similar to most movements, you will not understand the validity of the movement until you have a personal experience with the problem. 

However, when you have laws such as [the Duluth Model](http://www.theduluthmodel.org/about/) that enable police to arrest an innocent man, you will start to see the need. 
When your wife is beating you and you know that you cannot defend yourself because you will be imprisoned, that is when you will need help from this movement. 

Also, I do not think that most people understand truly understand what feminism is. My beliefs are confirmed when I hear feminists claim that they ["drink male tears"](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--l5XyX-6W--/851773464789881491.jpg). Most people who argue that they are feminists tend to use radical feminism to insult men. True feminists will not do this, however, I don't know if modern feminism is true feminism. 

Ultimately, people view men as if they are the source of evil. However, women commit just as many wrongs. Mens Rights is not simply about oppressing women, it's about justice.  </TEXT>

My long term ex girlfriend and I were young when we fell in love, however, our love was real. Eventually, she stopped treating me with respect. I was blind in love, therefore, I didn't see how bad things had become. She did, though. She broke up with me and told me this: "You try to see the best in everyone to the point where you can't recognize when something is bad for you or when someone is hurting you". Although it hurt at the time, she was right. When you love someone, you don't treat them bad; simple as that.  </TEXT>

I was standing face to face with a friend holding a conversation and a girl who I did not know reaches down my pants and starts making her way down my underwear. I did not know the girl and I had a girlfriend at the time, therefore, the attention was unwanted. I definitely found it offensive. When I turned around, I gave her a confused look. She and the rest of her friends proceeded to kick me out of the party. I think people can forget that women can sexually harass men. If it had been the other way around, I could have gone to jail.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) The biggest thing I have hidden from my parents is that I have two mental illnesses and at one point, I was suicidal. My parents don't support me emotionally so I just have kept it to myself. 

2) My father is extremely protective over my sister, especially with what she wears. It honestly makes me angry how conservative she is expected to dress. 

3) I definitely can see the double standard when it comes to purity. Sadly, I think this double standard comes from the world view that any sort of impurity will taint a woman (which I extremely disagree with). 

4) My parents are dictators in my household; you either do what they say or you can face some heavy consequences. Consequently, I tend to view God as an authoritarian which makes faith hard.

<TITLE> My OCD Story (A Journey into Scrupulosity) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-05 21:36:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *Warning: Wall of text post here, but this is my story 

I think a part of me died about six years ago. I could not tell you what happened in January 2009 that caused me to start hearing what I thought were voices in my head. I do remember the hours I would spend obsessing over what these voices said to me. I do remember the pain I felt when I butchered one of my ritualistic phrases and said that I &#8220;worship the devil&#8221; on accident. I do remember how I begged God and pleaded for Him to have mercy on my soul. The only thing I wanted was my sanity. 

--------

The voices did not stop. After awhile, the hope that was alive inside my body died. There was no place for me to confide. My parents emotionally abandoned me as a child. I always knew they were there for me when I needed to be controlled. If I ever forgot the rules, I knew they would remind me. As far as dealing with the wounds that life gave me, I was on my own. I stood alone. I stood in silence. I stood as a seventeen year-old boy who thought he was schizophrenic. I knew those voices were after me. I knew those demons were trying to kill my soul. I started waking up in the middle of the night because I needed to complete my rituals; I needed to defend myself from those voices. There were nights when I would toss and turn in my bed, begging for peace. I felt as if my soul was on fire. I was screaming through the flames and there was no one there to rescue me. There was no place for me to run. There was no way to escape my mind. 

------

There was also no one for me to confess. There was no comfort for me. Here I was, left in this wilderness alone. I knew time was coming to an end, soon. I believed Jesus was coming back soon. It could be any day now. I did not understand why I had to lose my sanity and my salvation, this close to the end of the world. I tried to do everything right: follow all of the rules, go to Sunday school, love my neighbor, all of the Christian mannerisms. I did not know why God was mad at me, but I knew He was done with me. I accepted this as my hell bound fate and continued to wander the wilderness. 

--------

After four years of hiding in shame and suffering, I finally came out and told one of my close friends I thought I was schizophrenic. He encouraged me to go to the school counseling office at my university. I learned a significant amount about my past during that time, however, I did not admit the &#8220;voices&#8221; I was hearing. After I started to lose my sanity more and my symptoms became harder to hide, I decided to see a cognitive behavioral therapist. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Depression. 

---------

When most people think of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, they often depict the man who cannot leave his house until he touches his doorknob three times. Some of my most common obsessions include contamination, doubting, and checking. The following are examples of my thoughts: &#8220;I left the door unlocked and someone is going to break into my house and steal my valuables. Did I turn the iron off? I left the iron on and now my house is going to burn down. Did I run over someone while I was driving? I hope this person burns in Hell&#8221; I could list many other disturbing thoughts, but I am often ashamed to admit these thoughts. Initially, I thought these were the demonic voices I was hearing. These violent, twisted thoughts were extremely contradictory to my normal thought pattern. I knew the thoughts could not belong to me. As I began to learn about OCD, I knew it was the disease that plagued my life. My OCD began with scrupulosity and has manifested into many forms of OCD. No one understands OCD&#8217;s toll on life quality: all I wanted was peace, however, reality became hell. I feel damned. 

---------

After all of the things that have changed in my life, nothing was the same. I have lost a part of me in this wilderness: hope. I have stopped hoping for things to get better. I have stopped hoping for my prayers to be answered. I stopped asking God to heal me from this disease. I stopped asking God to take me back. I was forced to grow up in this wilderness. I emerged as a new man and I don&#8217;t know if I will ever reclaim my previous sense of self. I cannot allow myself to hope again; hope hurts too much. 

Ahh, you think darkness is your ally? I was born in it, molded by it. I didn&#8217;t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding.

<TEXT> Ahh that makes sense. I wish people understood that mental illness is not any different than any other types of interest. I'm on Luvox right now and although it has not decreased my OCD, I have gained more time from spending it on compulsions. I also have Depression (I am unsure as to why, but I think I have an idea) which makes my OCD worse because I do not have as much energy to fight it. I have not heard of Welbutrin, but side effects for SSRIs are horrible. However, if I was not on any medications I would lose it.  </TEXT>
