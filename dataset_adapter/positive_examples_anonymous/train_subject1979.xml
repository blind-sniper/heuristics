<TEXT> I hear you. More than you know. I understand this deeply, from experience.
this is what we call a geographic change. Changing your environment or surroundings as a solution to a problem. 
Depression has a lot of factors, and I think it can be tricky.
Personally, I would love to tell you to go for it, but I know from my own experience, changing my environment didn't change my mindset, my thinking process, my depression or anxiety. 
Fresh starts are so appealing. Whatever decision you make, I support it. I support seeking happiness, just think it through. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 23. I stopped taking my meds because they were making me aggressive and I started suffering from dizzy spells. I feel better now that I'm off, not AS anxious. They worked for me until I grew out of them I guess.
I don't know. I think a lot of it is not being as active as I should in AA and the fellowship right now. I've done the steps, I've tried sponsoring, it's just being a young person in AA, it can be hard to find groups of people who take it seriously. 
I'm just so tired of feeling this way.  </TEXT>

As for NA/AA, the 12 steps are for anyone, it's about a change in perspective. both programs have done so much for my life, it's just that I'm too depressed and anxious to be so involved right now, and it's affecting my recovery. I'm a dry alcoholic right now.

<TEXT> I was in Brazil for two months visiting family. I wish I hadnt.
My boyfriend is a photographer and I saw on his page he took a few pictures of some girl.
She is our friends ex girlfriend, who's a heroin addict and put her through the wringer. 
My boyfriend decided to introduce her to my group of friends, as she doesn't have monday because she's from a different part of the state. She's been around while I've been gone.
I fought with my boyfriend when I saw those pictures, not knowing who she was. I found out, and I was over it.
I come home, excited to be back (it wasn't the easiest trip...family is tough) and the next two days she comes over. She works with him, and another mutual friend and my head took me to the darkest places. Do they have something? Have I been replaced?
In short, my mind won't stop, even though I KNOW none of this is true, and I feel like a psycho Fucking girlfriend and paranoid and sick and twisted and I want to relapse (2 years sober, alcoholic/addict) and I want to disappear. I hate admitting I have these insecurities, but I do. She's intimidated by me, and I talked to her, letting her know she's more than welcome here. To be honest, I wish she hadn't come into my life or anyone else's. I'm being selfish, I'm being horrible and I hate myself for being this person. I wish I had never existed. I hate myself and this is all so
Stupid and it sounds so
Stupid but it already hurts enough to write down my fears. It's been downplayed.
I don't think he would do anything to me. I know he didn't, but there is a voice in my head telling me that I'm alone, and everyone is hiding something from me. 

I'm in AA, I have resources, but I'd just rather hang myself in my closet and Dissapear.


EDIT: not monday, I meant she doesn't have many friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT: spelling and other dumb shit.


I am two years and 6 months sober(active member off AA and NA, hit my bottom with heroin) for the first time since I was 14. In and out of rehabs, outpatients, therapists, psychiatrists, detox
Centers, some trauma and a number of other things.  I got it right this time, and the last four years I've been with my boyfriend, who I met in treatment, and it has been amazing. (in the four years we've been together I've relapses...a lot. This was his first attempt getting sober and he got it the first time.) long story short, I'm exhausted. I hit the ground running when I picked up my first drink, and I'm
Finally living an adult life.

Because of my using and drinking, I haven't been to see my family in Brasil for 5 years, and I'm finally going at the end of december. I'm BEYOND excited, nervous, but so happy to see my family. At the same time, I'm fucking TERRIFIED.
The culture is so enticing, so lively and kind and welcoming and beautiful, and my alcoholic brain experiences this culture and thinks 'this would be even better with a drink in my hand.' I know the tools I can take to step away from that pattern I've so clearly displayed since my first rehab, but I'm scared. I'm 23, I should be fucking up and hooking up and not talking about marriage and kids and never drinking or using again, I should be running wild and traveling and getting into trouble.....

Right?

What if I meet someone? What if I'm not meant to be with who I am with now? (I love him more than I can explain, please keep in mind I'm allowed to be scared).
I would never do anything to hurt him, EVER. 
I'm just fucking scared. This trip is supposed to be a reunion, along with a break, some time for me to do some self reflection, take a breather.

I just dont know what to think about these feelings and fears.
I've never been good at the whole 'feelings' thing, (aka alcoholic), although ironically I am extremely sensitive.

FUCK. </TEXT>

I'm exhausted. 6+ rehabs, outpatients, school, therapists, school, psychiatrists, school, trauma, more rehab and more drugs and more alcohol, sober living, moving 3 times in two years, losing friends in sobriety and gaining them, 'dry' spells, (not working a program), relapses, people, work, school, lies.

Fuck. I wasted half of my childhood with depression, the rest of it loaded, (yes I understand I did that to myself), and I haven't stopped since. I just want to be taken care of. I want to just breathe a little bit. I just need a second to fucking process everything. I'm

<TEXT> I've been sober for two years. Ever since I was 13 I've been abusing drugs and alcohol. After multiple rehabs and outpatients and therapists and psychiatrists and anti-depressants, I've finally gotten sober. Keep in mind there is an entire 3-4 years of my life I've repressed, so I don't know what that holds. I'm in therapy now, I have a job, I'm in school, and I have a healthy relationship with someone who has 4 years of sobriety and loves me to death. I have great friends, a beautiful family, and I'm still hopeless. I hate myself. I'm not good enough, and this dark place in my head has been comfortable for so long that I can't get out. It's safe here and I don't have to face anything. I'm so tired. I've been on the go since I was 13, I wanted to grow up so fast, and now that I have I'm fucking exhausted. I'm just tired of not being happy with my body, myself, who I am. I refuse to take a compliment because I don't believe it. Please, tell me what the fuck I'm missing.

<TEXT> (3rd time posting, ever, all of which have been here, on /r/tifu. Still safe to say I'm an idiot.)

I still clench my butt cheeks thinking about this. It happened a few days ago. Friday night, busy, and crowded. I'm bussing that night, covering some girl's shift. Bussers at my restaurant are practically servers, except we don't take orders. ( we do all the fucking dirty work and deal with bullshit and get less money. ) anyway, I'm clearing plates off of a table, I mean, at least 8 or 9 heavy ass dinner plates, proceed to the next table
To clear some more, when I start to lose my footing on spilled beer  (I hadn't noticed), and slide my ass into the splits.(I can't do the splits.) About halfway through, I drop all the plates, and violently grab a
Patrons shoulder, clinging for dear life before my inner thighs rip open, crying out in pain. I quickly get up, mumble something alone the lines of 'fuckohmygodimsosorryletmegetoutofyourway', run/limp to the walk-in freezer, contemplate suicide, and open the door to find coworkers laughing in my face (not unusual.) I refused to go back into that section after cleaning up. I later had to walk over with my manager and thoroughly apologize while this guy and the rest of his family just stare at me like I just shat on their table.

Still haven't forgiven myself.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (I don't post..ever, but this is my second time posting on /r/TIFU..so it's safe to say I'm an idiot.)

After work, about two days ago, I was pretty tired after a lengthy and busy lunch serving shift. I needed to get cigarettes at the gas station, so my boyfriend took me straight there after he picked me up.
I run in, grab 'em,talk about how I need to quit with the cashier for the millionth time, and head back out.

not paying any attention to the make or model of a gunmetal colored car, I don't bother looking inside, and proceed to try to open the locked door on the passenger's side. I'm not looking inside, but kind if just staring ahead of me waiting for it to be unlocked. To my FUCKING HORROR,I see my boyfriend's car parked in front, and the driver looks at me and starts laughing, unlocking the car and rolling down the window saying, "am I missing something?"

It took me a minute too long to register, and after mumbling something stupid, I run to my boyfriend's car, turn last minute and see half of the people filling up and waiting to fill up laughing. 

I jump in the fucking car and tell him to get the fuck out of there,
Meanwhile covering my face with both hands and repeatedly saying " ohmygodohmygod."

Haven't forgiven myself yet.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today, I FUCKED up.

Let me start by saying I adore my animals,  all animals. 

My friend has this weird long-haired chihuahua papillon.
Wicket. Sweetheart, tiny, and well taken care of (by me, usually she smells like cigarettes and has little mats. Roommate loves her, is just completely fucking clueless.)
Anyway, after giving Wicket a bath and drying her off a bit, I started to trim her hair, and some of the mats. I used to groom dogs, bathe them, etc., so I was comfortable doing it. 
I found a huge fucking rats nest of a mat behind her ear, cleared around it and slowly started to trim. Wicket didn't move,cry, or give ANY sign she was in distress, and just sat there blinking slowly.
I kept trimming, tried to pull some of the excess hair out of the way and noticed something bright pink. When I moved closer and moved the remaining mat I found I had practically cut off the back of her fucking ear. Bright pink skin, veins and blood vessels galore. Nothing to protect it, just skin. The second layer of her fucking skin. 

I fucking lost it.
Not the gore, that does bother me. It was the fact that,because this dog is so small in size, including her ears, she practically had no first layer of skin/fur on the back of her ear.

Ran to my car, ran a red light to the emergency vet just to be sent home, and was told to out hydrogen peroxide on it.

Roommate? Killed me. Freaked out
on me, rightly so, and slapped the back of my head.


Wicket is fine, it healed perfectly. I took her to the vet, no stitches required, but apparently I was extremely close to doing major damage.


I will never groom another animal. </TEXT>

There is only so much I can get from a book, and it's refreshing to see someone who is so open and willing to talk about it. I'm happy you're leading a productive,happy and somewhat 'normal' life, whatever that means(:
I'm curious, and if you don't mind, expanding on the voices? You mentioned three? 
Thanks!

<TEXT> I used to do this a lot, long story short it got worse before I got sober. It is most likely stress or anxiety related. It's about finding the right outlet,
And your arms and face and sometimes other peoples bodies are the outlets right now. You don't feel good when you do if,
But you do it anyway. I get it! There are other ways, I'm not going to say go read a book or go for a walk,
I mean like write, cry and TALK to someone about whatever is hurting you and causing you to hurt yourself! Don't be discouraged, we all
Have our shit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. If you've set a boundary verbally multiple times, and this isn't something that she's willing to respect, it's probably going to be a more serious conversation. My boyfriend gets these spots, and I ask if I can get them, when he says no, he's made it clear it's NO.
He usually doesn't mind, but sometimes he's just not in the mood. 
Point is, if she can't respect this boundary, what about others? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've waited until the strip was completely dry, but sometimes the way I put it on my nose made it become wrinkled in the process, and so I'd have
Parts of the strip with blackheads and others without.

<TEXT> Depends on the person,like myself for example. I love animals, I was raised in a family that loved animals, so it's  also learned behavior, as well as personality. There are different things that mold our personalities, and different things that make us happy, aka trigger our 'pleasure centers.'
As humans, we enjoy company, and most of us are instinctually very nurturing. And animals give us unconditional love, no judgement.  it's a pretty awesome process out minds go through.
