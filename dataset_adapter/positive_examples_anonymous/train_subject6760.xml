My first boyfriend. I think that is my best relationship to date. It was a long-distance one and he got stolen away by someone who was very much like me who was closer to him. This happened so quickly, I was stunned and went into a downward spiral. Took me a year to get back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for cutting in - if you get the time please check my responses below.

I'm in Mumbai, India. I have a similar problem getting my psychotropic meds for depression/anxiety. I have to go get them every month and it's quite traumatic because of the sheer anxiety of the pharmacists judging me. If I understand correctly, in the US, pharmacies get prescriptions directly from shrinks (at least that's what my friend in NYC told me), and you just have to walk up there and get your meds. Here, I have to get a physical prescription, go on the same date, and then stand for about 20 minutes to eventually get my meds. Plus, sometimes, they say "not in stock," which means I'll have to call them and/or visit them multiple times. I wish things were easier/better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, here (in Mumbai, India) they need a copy of the prescription for records, plus your address and the doctor's address. I have to go to a large pharmacy to get it and there only one guys knows me. In fact, the last time, I had to write my registration number on the prescription because they would not give me another brand of the same generic medication because they think that if the doctor has prescribed one brand only that should be given. I thought it was ridiculous. I showed them my doctor's registration and then they had to give me. Still traumatic! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Infinite. 

Color is a way we interpret and differential the frequencies/wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. As far as we know, the range of electromagnetic radiation is nearly infinite (from the smallest possible wavelength = Planck's constant to as large as the universe is).

Remember that the colors that we (the human eye) can see are limited to the types of cones that we have (three types). Many animals have more cone types, with cephalopods having the maximum as far as I know. But that's still limited. The "ideal" eye should be able to detect infinite number of colors.

<TEXT> Your story is very similar to a friend of mine who rescues sick kittens. She in fact has a rescued kitten with a fractured spine, for whom she's trying to find a new home. 

Some of the things that I do...

- I try to give almost everyone another chance -- in the sense, I rarely write anyone off because they have been rude to me. 
- I try to give most people the benefit of doubt while they seem to screw up.
- I am an out, relatively young, but mature gay individual in India. I try to help younger gay men whenever they have some issues with relationships/family.
- I suffer from depression. I try and promote depression awareness in all my circles, so as to bring more tolerance and understanding about all kinds of psychological condition.
- I try to be friendly with most animals that I encounter in my life. Playing with them, cuddling them, feeding them when I can, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been listening to NPR All Songs Considered for a year now and I love the discoveries that I'm making. I wonder if there are other similar stations.

Edit:

Some of the aspects that I'm looking for are as follows:
- Incisive, insightful commentary/DJing (not needed 24*7)
- An online playlist where you can find the name of the songs played
- Preferably with features on new releases

I used to listen to a alternative/indie/rock station called Meta on TuneIn Radio. They had great DJs but they closed about a year or so back. Since then, I have been listening to NPR All Songs Considered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been using a Kindle Paperwhite for a few months. I love to read on it. I would like to read text books and study on it too. The problem is that most text books come as PDF files, and the formatting goes awry if you convert it to *.mobi. You can of course read PDFs directly, but navigation is cumbersome. Considering these, I have two questions.

1. Does anyone know of a better way for PDF to mobi conversion?

2. How can you convert essays/large articles/websites into a format to read on Kindle.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Many people have suggested that I get out of this "unhealthy" relationship. But I guess I'm an optimist, hoping that things will change someday. Plus, I love him and most if his other aspects. Ergo, I'm scared of not finding someone else. :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my present relationship, I cannot bring up even unresolved conflicts from the recent past for a calm, rational discussion. Seems like all conflicts remain unresolved and swept under the rug. I, being acutely aware of their vile history, am even more cagey. So it really is building up and I don't know when I'll explode/break down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure I understand the second sentence. I think you meant than when you resorted to passive aggressive ways, there bad repercussions. I rarely ever shout, swear at, bad mouth, throw things, or let steam out because I think I'm the "good" or the "better" guy. I think no conflict works. Instead, educated conversations detailing problems and working on solutions works for me with other people. But my partner doesn't work this way. I'm stuck and I'd also like others' views. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been diagnosed with PTSD and MDD. in on pharmacotherapy and therapy. One of my main triggers is conflict or the fear of conflict. Unfortunately, I'm exposed to it a lot because my partner believes in fights and arguments. He thinks that these are signs of a healthy relationship. I am finding it difficult to manage the relationship, especially because I have tendencies for being  codependent and he's the dominant (older) one in the relationship. Can anyone suggest a strategy? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can't most, if not all, fantasy/sci-fi scenarios be explained in the Stargate universe? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-03 21:57:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently discovered the Stargate franchise. Being a sci-fi fan, I couldn't believe that I had missed it all this while. I watched the first movie after getting hooked to Stargate Universe's pilot. Since then, I have been watching Stargate SG1. I think that with the basic premise of Stargates, terraforming technology creating many earth-like planets, and the presence of superior races, almost every possible fantasy/scenario can be taken care of. 

For example, the Alien Universe (The Engineers = Ancients in Stargate), Game of Thrones/The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings (terraformed planets with transplanted earthlings coexisting with apparently alien species), the Marvel/DC universes (Thor franchise is directly mentioned), etc. 

What do you all think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you can believe that people on the other side of the world on the internet want to listen to you, it's likely that there are people in your immediate vicinity who will be. Just remember this - you are not an idiot/moron/bad person. Your brain and the chemical inside are making you feel this. Have you tried seeking professional help? If not, I would encourage you to do it. 

I will share with you an anecdote. A few years back, I was reeling under the first wave of full-fledged clinical depression. I was stubborn/obstinate and decided that there was no point in living anymore. I was then in a long-distance relationship. My then boyfriend listened to me and asked me to give myself 6 months. After 6 months, if I felt the same, he said he would let me do it. During the 6 months, however, my boyfriend got through to my friends and was able to start me on medication. That helped. I was able to cope better.

Maybe you can also do that. Here's a hug. Wish it were a real one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did not mean to make you feel worse and I'm sorry that I did. Because I suffer from depression (low self-esteem/lack of self worth/self-flagellation), I try to help anyone that I come across who is more vulnerable than I'm at that point in time. This is such an effort. I wish I could be there to hug you,  honestly do. 

I have been through similar painful situations and there has been someone or the other who has helped me. Talk to someone who is close (physically, emotionally, or both) to you. Sometimes you don't even need reciprocation - you just need to be listened to. 

Finally, I know this wouldn't make sense to you, as it wouldn't to me if someone else where saying this when I'm feeling like this - this one too shall pass.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are times when I have felt similarly lost. But I have been under therapy for over five years now and I keep myself going with some good friends and help from my boyfriend. I am a musician as well. So I set some goals in learning new techniques skills or improving existing ones. Apart from that, at times when everything out there appears so intimidating, I increase my already avid range of sports and entertainment options. For example, with the world cup football around, I'm trying to follow nations and their star players. I eventually want to follow the club leagues and competitions so that I have something to look forward to other than friends and music. </TEXT>
