<TEXT> I'm playing through this game for the first time, and I find I have a lot of potions that I have no real intention of using, but that could earn me some cash, but I can't find anyone to buy them off me. Is there anyone I can sell them to? I'm just about to go to Dorm's Deep, if that makes any difference (in terms of NPCs available at this point).

Thanks! </TEXT>

 Several barographs recorded the wave seven times over the course of five days: four times with the wave travelling away from the volcano to its antipodal point, and three times travelling back to the volcano. **Hence, the wave rounded the globe three and a half times.**

<TITLE> Tip for collecting Zee Stories, Memories of Distant Shores, and Tales of Terror. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-10 23:52:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my game, my ambition is to write the Zong of the Zee, for which you need 77 of each of the objects listed in my title, and it can be pretty tedious trying to collect them all. But I've stumbled on a great way to collect them. 

If you go through the Isle of Cats storyline, you might end up with a SAY notice in the port that says "Walk through the rose garden". (I say might, because I don't know if it happens every time or is a chance thing).

Each time you choose this, you receive either 10 MoDS, or 10 ToT. If you then head to the shop Wind Come Calling in Irem, you can exchange 2 ToT for one Zee Story, rather than relying on Jillyfleurs, and giving news to light ships. I did this, and got my all my zee stories in no time at all :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quite a good way to farm secrets in Iron Republic. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-10 22:13:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Apologies if this is common knowledge, but I've discovered a pretty good way of getting secrets that you can carry out in the Iron Republic. If you arrive there and your Terror is 70 or higher, one of the options available after a SAY notice is to "Listen". This gives you a minimum of 70 fragments every time. Then you can just sit in port and keep doing this every time you get a new SAY. I was lucky in my map because Pigmote Isle was near the IR, so I could just go there and reduce my terror by attending a banquet in my honour. But it meant I was getting a secret every 5 days, which equated to about 6 minutes!

Anyway, hope that's of some use!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your replies, I've actually figured out how to get the shop to open, even if you've missed the 1-4 day window.

The shops in the IR open on a rotational basis, depending on how many days you've been there, but it also involves a bit of chance. This is how to get the House of Pleasures:

1. Take note of your days spent in IR.
2. When you arrive at IR, if your days spent is less than 15, send your sailors ashore, which increases your days spent by between 2 and 4. Be wary though, this increases terror quite a bit.
3. Continue to do this until your days spent is over 15, when it says The Explusus (I think it's called) is now open. (You'll need to sit in the dock until a Something Awaits You appears each time. Bring plenty of supplies!).

THIS IS WHERE CHANCE COMES INTO IT. SAVE AT THIS POINT IF YOU AREN'T DOING THE INVICTUS PLAYTHROUGH.

Now, instead of sending your sailors ashore, open the shop. This resets the day counter. However, it sometimes resets the days to 5, which means you miss out on House of Pleasures and have to do the cycle again, and sometimes it resets it to 1, which will open House of Pleasures for you. Keep reloading till you get it! :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Smuggling red honey to London - is this sustainable? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-03 23:08:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've just managed to get to the point in the Isle of Cats where I can start buying Red Honey for 600, to then sell it on the brass embassy in London for 999. The way I do it is to buy some red honey, then just sit in port for 10 days or so, buying another cargo of honey each day. Then, when I return to London, I bribe the dock officials 500 echos, which is only a small percentage of the profit I then make.

But is this something I can do indefinitely, or does something happen when suspicion gets too high?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Celtic's average attendance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-03 13:36:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just had a quick look at a table of [Celtic's average attendances](http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/club_records_league_attendance.php) over the years, as every time I watch highlights from a game at Celtic Park there's always loads of empty seats.

It says that the average attendance for this year is 43,951, which would be the lowest since 1996. Living in England, I'm not really privvy to the ins and outs of Scottish football as much anymore, and was wondering what the reasons are for the low attendances?

Obviously, having no Rangers has had an effect, and these are still difficult times for people financially, but is there anything else to it? Are fans not happy with the way the team's playing? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just arrived at Port Cecil in my game, and before getting supplies etc. I moved on one of the storylines. The trouble is, the reward was 7 of an item that I don't want, and I had exactly 7 cargo space left in my hold. I thought I would be able to go to the shop and buy fuel, then dump the unwanted cargo, but the BUY option is greyed out. I have 0 fuel left, and if I can't fix this my game is fucked because it saved it after I did that. I really don't want to die and have to do all this shit again, it's the one part of the game that just isn't for me.

If there's no way to dump cargo, can I manipulate the save file or something to get rid of the unwanted items? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, if this post doesn't really belong in this sub, please feel free to remove, mods. I put it here because I need plants that can grow in UK climates.

My housemates and I have decided to rip out the horrible weeds in our back garden, and attempt to grow some plants (preferably shrubs or large plants) that will attract pollinating insects. The problem is, we know the square root of fuck all when it comes to gardening, and have no idea what plants to look for. Can anyone suggest any that we could plant? To be honest, it does need to be a plant that would require almost no maintenance besides maybe cutting it back occasionally. We all work silly hours, so actually looking after said plants won't be too high on our priority lists! </TEXT>

But on the way home tonight, I was reading the Evening Standard, where the front page article was about how Wills and Kate have used a new PR team this time, and are keeping things much more under wraps.

Well, I'm pleased to say it's clearly worked, because I had absolutely no idea that, not only was the baby expected soon, but that it's actually overdue now! 

So a big thank you to the PR team from me!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the Wiki page:

 Air traffic controller Gilles Logelin noticed the flames before the Concorde was airborne, however with only 2 km (1.2 mi) of runway remaining and travelling at a speed of 328 km/h (204 mph), its only option was to take off. The Concorde would have needed at least 3 km (1.9 mi) of runway to abort safely.

<TEXT> I've only just started playing Skylines, and one of the things I've started adding through Workshop is the high rise office blocks, because I want to create a CBD type area like La Defense or something. I go to the relevant Workshop page and click subscribe, and when I go into the content manager menu of Skylines, all the office blocks are there and set to 'on'. But when I actually zone offices in-game, it's the same 2 or 3 that keep appearing over and over, despite subscribing to more than 20. A couple of them turned out to be unique buildings, which I hadn't realised, but it still falls way short of what I was hoping to see.

Am I missing anything? Is there some kind of script extender I need, like you do for some Skyrim mods?

Nope, I've never once thought about actually going ahead and doing anything, mainly because the thoughts I have are of me being killed or injured by something external, not by something I've done to myself.

<TEXT> What a brilliant comment, thanks mate! Are the US really that far behind with the use of technology? I find that really surprising!

Like I said, the reason I find the book so fascinating is because of how it had to be carried out with no DNA or computers. If Sutcliffe has started killing now, he'd have been caught after the first victim probably! 

I also find it amazing that it was on a hunch that they caught him as well. If I remember rightly, when Sutcliffe was arrested from in the car, he asked to go for a piss, which the police let him do, at which point he dropped the murder weapon he'd been using behind a small wall. It was only later in the station that one of the policemen thought to go back to the scene (I think he might have heard a slight clink noise but I can't remember that much) and when they went back they found the screwdriver that Sutcliffe had been using. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If anyone is interested in true crime, I highly recommend the book about the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper called Wicked Beyond Belief. It's absolutely massive, but it's the best book I've ever read. It's incredible the amount of work and man hours that went into the investigation, because it was all before computers and DNA. Unfortunately, it also shows you how West Yorkshire police made lots of mistakes during their investigation, and just weren't ready to cope with an investigation of that magnitude. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Little bit of trivia regarding this. The German metal group Rammstein named themselves after the place where the accident happened. From Wikipedia:

*The band was named after the Ramstein air show disaster. At first, the band had denied this and said that their name was inspired by the giant doorstop type devices found on old gates, called Rammsteine. The extra "m" in the band's name makes it translate literally as "ramming stone".*

<TEXT> I work as a primary school teacher, and this is spot on. At my school we set for literacy and maths, but not for the afternoon subjects like History, Geography, French etc. This effectively means I need to create 3 lesson plans for those lessons, to make sure all pupils can access the lesson, and I don't even have anyone who would be considered to have severe special needs to the point where they need further support. My colleagues have this though, so they're having to do what I am, plus take the SEN children into account. 

I agree that this is the main reason teachers are quitting in droves. How people with kids manage, I'll never know. At the moment I work almost every waking hour (literally), and I still don't get everything done. Granted, part of this is down to time management on my part, but the workload is ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Having trouble with ethernet drivers after installing 64 bit Windows. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-31 18:58:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone at Tech Support. I recently purchased Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, because I wanted to play games like Far Cry 4 and use things like Lightroom much more efficiently. I installed the OS with no problems, but now I'm having an absolute nightmare with drivers, especially the internet ones (I'm writing this on a laptop I borrowed.)

The infuriating thing is that I know the model and make of PC, but when I go to the official site (or any driver site for that matter) and download the drivers I think I need, they don't work. I get a message saying "The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64 bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher." I've been making sure to download the 64 bit versions, so I have no idea where this is coming from.

I've tried going into device manager and looking up the driver details for the ethernet controller, but there are none. 

If anyone could help, I'd be so grateful!

My PC is a Hewlett Packard model: H8-1010cs

If it makes any difference, the guy i bought it from bought it in the Czech Republic (I got it second hand).

I just installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. (6.1, Build 7600)

BIOS: Ver: CHG_7 9.rom vCHG7.09

Directx 11

8 gb ram

Intel i7-2600 3.4ghz

Thanks for any help you may be able to give! </TEXT>

And he got the ball when he was past the last defender, but offside counts from when the ball is passed, at which point Mata was still onside, albeit by the smallest of margins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Judging by the comments already posted, I think I might be in the minority, but I can't wait for this to happen. I've always been far more impressed with the blue whale skeleton just because of its sheer size and I think it's going to look absolutely  amazing the way they're doing it! Really looking forward to this :)

I'm also impressed with their reasons for doing so. Dinosaurs are amazing and everything, but they're gone! If this inspires little boys and girls to try and save the animals we have left I'm all for it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The BBC text description of West Ham's goal is brilliant :)

Oh dear! Crisp packet wrists from Hull keeper Allan McGregor, and it's costly. The Scot can only parry out a dipping strike from Enner Valencia and Andy Carroll lumbers into view to bury the loose change. Must do better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I often wonder how much coverage stories like this get, outside of the countries that they happen in. This was absolutely massive news at the time here in the UK, and I can personally only think of a few stories that garnered more coverage in my lifetime (death of Princess Di, Maddy McCann disappearance maybe). It makes me think there must be loads of huge events or things that have happened in other places, where people who live there all know about it, but that I'm completely oblivious about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find this clip a really interesting insight into the mind of someone like Costa (i.e. a prolific striker). Being a more defensive minded player when I play, I would have cut that ball back every time, to whoever was running in, because I'm not very confident at finishing. But Costa just sticks his head down and buries it himself. </TEXT>

I'll get more of the pavement next time. I took it a long time ago, but I think I the top portion is a bit higher, not for the windows, but for the flagpoles. But I can take it again without them in the top and see how it looks.

<TEXT> I've recently purchased my first proper SLR, and one of the things I love to take pictures of is shop and restaurant fronts because I like pictures that are busy, and have lots of little detail and different textures for the eye to look at, and was wondering if anyone could critique this picture?

Personally, I think I've made it too dark, and I should have waited until there were actually people eating outside the restaurants (although I do think the darkness of the restaurants makes the signs stand out a bit more), but can anyone else give me any tips? I'm heading to Paris in about a month, and really want to improve on this style of picture taking before then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm only a hobbyist photographer, so I'm not going to try and give advice on technique! But speaking as someone who just likes looking at photos, I personally found the figure in the right-foreground to be too intrusive. It was the first thing that drew my eye when I opened the picture, but it didn't really lead my eye into the rest of it. And when I was trying to look at the rest of the picture, my eyes were still drawn over to the figure.

<TEXT> Hello photography!

Like many of the questions posted already, I'm looking for advice on what camera to buy. I've been using a DSC-R1 for the past year and a half-ish, and it's served me well, but I bought it second hand, and it's started becoming temperamental, so I've decided to go ahead and get a new one, which will allow me to change the lens as well.

I was looking at the Sony A500 which seems to get good reviews, and is within my budget range (don't really want to go above &#163;250). Is this a good camera to start with? And would I be able to put a macro lens on it?

My favourite subjects for pictures are architecture, sculpture, and street photography, if that makes any difference to your answers.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dan Marino is one of the best quarterbacks to ever play American Football, but he never won the Superbowl, in the same way that Gerrard hasn't won the Premier League (although obviously he has won the Champions League, which could be considered bigger).

I can't really put my finger on why I don't like him to be honest, I just never warmed to him at all. Although one thing that did really annoy me was when he had the brass neck to chastise players in his book for diving, as if he was some paragon of fair play, when he was hardly innocent of it himself. Obviously he was never as bad as Drogba or Ronaldo at their worst, but he still did it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, this news has affected me in a way I never thought possible. Although this sounds completely juvenile and petty (because it is) I've been actively supporting any team that plays Liverpool for years and years, and praying that they don't win the league while Gerrard is there, because I just can't stand the guy, and thought I'd have a right laugh when he retired with no league medals.

But now that it looks like it's actually happening, I find that I'm actually really saddened by it, which I was not expecting at all! He's like the Dan Marino of football!

Best of luck to the guy wherever he goes, he's definitely one of the PL greats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first part of the book is about how to illicit the relaxation response in your body (the opposite of the response to stress) by using methods such as deep breathing or mindful meditation. I started doing meditation, thinking it wouldn't really work for me, but it's been the best thing I've ever taken up, but it has to be consistent to work.

Then it gets you to do an audit of your needs. Are you happy in your work? Do you have enough friends? etc. And then you work on each of these as much as you can. So, if you lack a social circle, joining a class or something like that to get you out meeting people.

Do you have to do a lot of work at home, or does your work finish at 5.30 and then you're done? If so, you've got loads of time to meet other people! Even if it takes you 30 minutes to get home, then an hour to relax and get something to eat, you still have time to do stuff. I think the most important thing is trying to find something you enjoy, so that you'll be more likely to actually do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry to hear about your difficulties mate, this is something I can certainly relate to. I came back from travelling a few years ago, and since then I've felt really lost in life, and unfortunately I also developed a moderate depression, while all my friends seem to be settled and happy.

[This](http://www.amazon.co.uk/lift-depression-Human-Givens-Approach/dp/1899398414) is a book that I've found really useful to help me get by. Although the main focus of the book is about how to lift depression, it can also be used as a prevention rather than a cure. I'm pointing this book out, because telling yourself things will get better isn't a very proactive approach, and I've found that to be one of the biggest factors in how I feel. If you don't change anything in your life, it's unlikely things will just change of their own accord and get better for you in general. I really hope I'm not coming across as patronising here, I have no idea of your personal circumstances - I'm just going by my own personal experiences.

And when you say you have nobody to guide you out of it, I would seriously recommend some kind of talk therapy with a professional if that's the case. Having some kind of support is so important at times like this. Even having someone you can offload to is a big help.

Anyway, I hope I haven't offended, and apologies if I have. I hope that 2015 does prove to be a better year for you!

Take care :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> XBox 360 controller for Windows doesn't stop vibrating </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-29 15:14:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi TechSupport,

I recently purchased an XBox 360 controller for Windows, because there are certain games I play where it's beneficial to have one. One of those games was South Park Stick of Truth, but I'm having a major issue with it.

When you are in a battle in the game, the pad vibrates when you block or do a power attack. But more often than not, my pad gets stuck on vibrate, and eventually turns itself off. It means when I play I need to constantly take out and put back in the controller. In the space of one fight, I end up having to do this about 7-8 times, and it's completely ruining my enjoyment of the game.

The problem is, there is no way to turn off vibration in the in-game settings, and the keyboard and mouse controls are absolutely dreadful.

If anyone could provide a solution for this I'd be very grateful. I've seen this problem on Steam forums, so it's a known issue, but none of the threads I've read seem to provide any answers. I'd be happy to download some free software that would allow me to disable vibration on the pad completely, not just for SP. I don't think it ever adds anything to games anyway.

Any help would be very gratefully received.

Thanks

<TEXT> I recently subscribed to /r/pics but quickly unsubscribed, as I felt the content was really poor. What I expected was to see loads of interesting pictures, but so many of the posts are completely mundane pictures that get upvoted just because of some assoicated sob story or manipulative anecdote and it's really not what I'm after!

Can anyone recommend some good subs for pictures that are interesting as they are? I've already subbed to /r/pic, /r/EarthPorn and /r/photography, but would love to hear suggestions for any more.

The kind of things I like looking at are:

Wildlife and Nature

Old buildings and architecure

Old artefacts and objects

Space

Landscapes

Fantasy stuff (LotR type things - pictures or art)


If anyone knows any good ones, that aren't in the categories above, I'll definitely consider them. Please don't link me to any gory stuff though, don't want to see that!

Thanks in advance :) </TEXT>

I've just got off the phone to him, and the stuff he's described is horrific :(

He could have played the game of his life, but still lost the final due to someone else's fuck up. It shouldn't affect his personal status as a player IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Since he's so fucking good at dribbling, people can forget how insanely clinical Messi is.

This is absolutely me! When I think of Messi, I don't think of him as an incredible goalscorer, even though he clearly is. I think the reason you mentioned is definitely a large part of it, but I also think it's because of the way he just kind of gets on with it, and doesn't make a big show of things.

Whereas when I think about Ronaldo, the first thing I think about is how he's an absolute goal machine, and I think a large part of that is because he's so 'box office' for lack of a better term.

<TEXT> As mentioned in another thread, I'm upgrading to Win 7 64 bit, and one of the things I need for it is a bootable USB stick. But can I put other stuff on it as well?

I was going to buy a 64gb stick, make it the bootable USB, but also have some stuff on their that I can't really afford to lose from my current PC.

Is that do-able, or will I need 2 separate USB sticks?

<TITLE> Looking to Ebay to upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit, but I'm a bit wary and I'm looking for some advice please! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-22 22:06:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just bought and installed Shadow Of Mordor, only to discover that I hadn't read the min spec closely enough and that it requires 64 bit Windows, which I don't have. I then checked my PC specs, and know that it can run 64 bit Windows, so I'm going to get the upgrade.

I would buy a normal full price version of it from the shops, but it's so expensive, and I don't have massive amounts of disposable income at the moment.

So because of that, I went on Ebay to see what they had, but I'm naturally a bit wary as to the authenticity of the stuff available there.

I just had a look at these two pages:

[Windows Home](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-64Bit-with-SP1-OEM-Full-Version/141443344445?_trksid=p2047675.c100010.m2109_trkparms=aid%3D555012%26algo%3DPW.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20140221143405%26meid%3D544e47b48dea4faaaeedaeb361e83b99%26pid%3D100010%26prg%3D20140221143405%26rk%3D3%26rkt%3D24%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D221586675678)

[Windows Pro](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Microsoft-Windows-7-Professional-SP-1-Full-Version-64-Bit-Pro-With-DVD-COA-/221586675678?pt=UK_Computing_Software_Software_SRhash=item33979857de)

How likely is it that they're above board? I mean, the Windows Home one talks about being a Dell DVD, but in the description it says it'll run on any machine.

I'd really appreciate any advice on this, I want to avoid any blunders!

Thanks! </TEXT>

I'm saying tomorrow because obviously the game itself is a few months away, and we might be playing better by then.

But what Rangers have really got going for them is that there won't be any pressure on them at all, it's all going to be on us. I do wonder how we'll cope with that. </TEXT>

A barely deserved lead?? Based on that half, a Liverpool lead wouldn't even be remotely deserved, never mind barely. It's incredible how QPR aren't at least 1 goal up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bit that really impressed me was the second pass from Fabregas. I could be wrong, but it looks to me like he wasn't expecting the return pass from the first player (don't know who it is), and even if he was, the pass looked like it was hit back at him way too hard, but he still managed to thread the ball straight to the feet of the guy on the edge of the box with the outside of his foot! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I do follow F1, I've never been so into it that I know all the technicalities of it, and was wondering if someone could explain something to me. In the years that Vettel was winning the WDC, Red Bull were almost untouchable, but now that's what's happening for Mercedes, while Red Bull are competing with the likes of Williams etc.

What is it that allows one team to improve so much from one season to the next, as Mercedes have done, or as Red Bull did when they dominated? I don't understand where this massive disparity comes from.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is the reason I don't feel primarily British. Because England is by far the biggest country in Britain, a lot of people say British, when they mean English (especially people who don't live here).

Despite sharing a border, I actually think Scotland and England are two very different places. So quite often when people talk about British culture, or British identity, when they actually mean English, I just don't relate to any of it, so I don't have that connection.

Another thing is that the mainstream British media is heavily anglo-centric, again due to the population etc. and it's hard to feel like you're part of Britain when the overwhelming majority of stories etc. are centred around England. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to say, I'm the complete opposite, and the results of this survey have actually been a bit of an eye opener for me.

If anyone ever asks me what nationality I am, I will always say Scottish. If they then ask if that makes me British, I'd answer yes. But I would never even think to answer British in the first instance, and I assumed that most people would be the same i.e. they would say English or Welsh before British, but seemingly not!

So while I certainly consider myself British, I'm definitely in the "Scottish first, British second" camp.

And yet, my username contains UK! I'm a walking hypocrite.

<TEXT> This was the semi final of the Champions League in 2007-2008. Chelsea and Liverpool had drawn the first leg 1-1, and the second leg had finished 1-1 after full time, so extra time was being played. The penalty put Chelsea ahead 2-1, and they went on to win that game overall, 3-2.

The added significance of the penalty is that Frank Lampard was taking it, and his mother had died in the week leading up to the game, so there was a huge emotional aspect to it as well. </TEXT>

He compared it to City's approach, where they were still passing the ball around in the last few minutes of the game against QPR that they needed to win the league the previous year, and of course, Aguero popped up and stuck it away. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Personally I'm gutted that we had a chance to start fresh because we had loads of decent players coming through from the youth academy, and wasted it. But Ally didn't seem to trust any of them and they've scattered to the four winds of obscure no-mark teams because that's where they're guaranteed a game.

Exactly. Rangers had a chance to create a team from the ground up, with loads of youth players, but instead they signed much older players like Jon Daly etc.

They seemed to have an air of desperation to to get back into the SPL at the first time of asking (through the respective divisions), but obviously didn't have enough faith in their younger players to do that, so signed more experienced ones, but at huge cost.

Would an administration flush out Wallace etc.? Or does it have to be a liquidation for that to happen? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And seriously, very few in Sweden can name any players in Celtic. Because they're so mediocre.

If you're going to use the argument that Celtic are mediocre because very few people in your country could name any of our players, then I'm afraid the exact same has to be said of Malmo. How many people in Scotland do you think can name any of the Malmo first team without looking it up on Wikipedia?

I actually agree that the Swedish league is stronger than the Scottish league at the moment, but the fact of the matter is that, in European terms, we're both pretty mediocre, and don't exactly set Europe alight these days, so I doubt many people outside our own countries will know any of our teams players. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, this is just my personal viewpoint, but I find being a Celtic fan so frustrating at the moment because of the fixation on European football. Don't get me wrong, I love being involved in the Champions League, but to me, it's not the be-all and end-all. Our team has clearly gotten worse over the past few years, but I'd happily sacrifice Champions League football, if it meant a more competitive league came of it. With Champions League football, we get a minimum of 3 cracking nights at Celtic Park, and very occasionally 4. If the gap in the league closes, as you've spoken about in your post, the league could be on it's way back to the days of the 80s, when teams like Aberdeen and Hearts regularly challenged for the title, something which I'd love to see. I don't mind if we win the league year on year, but only if we don't stroll to it, where's the excitement in that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I can't speak for all Celtic fans of course, but I'm not going to lie - I'm still enjoying it to be honest, for no other reason than they're our biggest rivals, and it's always fun to watch your rivals struggle (see the current Liverpool - Manchester United situation). I realise this is the antithesis of being 'classy' - something which doesn't go down too well in this sub it seems, but there you have it - I just see it as part of the rivalry. Rangers fans were giving us absolute pelters after we got shat on in 2 rounds of Champions League qualifying, and when we nearly went to the wall ourselves in 1994, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It's all just give and take IMO.

Yes, it's absolutely shite for their fans, who just want to go and support their team, but have a board full of fuckwits who only seem to be in it to make a quick buck, but like I said, I'm not going to pretend otherwise just because I'm on Reddit! </TEXT>

Despite the name and reputation of Rangers, how much can a team from the Scottish Championship (or whatever division they were in when Ashley bought them) realistically get (or have gotten)?

I'm not being hypothetical here, I'm genuinely wondering if there's any indications.

<TEXT> Ah, I should have said, I also used marines! Siege tanks to stop the zerg waves, marines to stop Kerrigan. That was enough to complete it on hard, but didn't get the achievements. The most fun thing about that mission for me though, was the fact that I had the hive mind emulator and built loads of them. Any time a brutalisk came near (are they the really big ones, I can't even remember!) I controlled it, killed the smaller zerg with it, then sent it straight up the ramp to the artifact. By the time the end came, where the worms pop up right beside the artifact, I had ten of the bastards, fully healed, just waiting for them :D It was great!

Once I'd completed it, I did it again, with more measured numbers of marines, rather than just pumping them out, along with a small banshee force. That was enough to get rid of the worms outside the base, and I comfortably got the achievements :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I'm pretty sure that losing 6-3 to most teams would leave me raging, but this felt different. I think it's because, even though we lost, we still took the game to Chelsea, and managed to take 3 goals off them, which is no mean feat, especially when you consider how good their defence is, and the fact that they're the favourites for the title in many people's eyes.

Obviously our defense needs a lot of work, and Howard was dreadful today, but I don't know, this loss didn't leave me feeling that deflated. Chelsea are just an awesome side! </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but it would at least give the other teams a better, and fairer, chance to reach the deeper stages at least.

Although what you've said also touches on my second wish - to do away with the group stages altogether!!

I remember when the European Cup was knockout from the start, and I'd love those days to come back. I can understand people's viewpoints of wanting to see the likes of Real Madrid play, and if they were to be knocked out in the first round, there'd be a lot of unhappy people (not least the sponsors). But personally speaking, I'd love that. As I said, I think it's much more sporting to do it this way, but I know that will never happen, as money rules all these days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I've read, if the share issue fails, Rangers could face administration. I know that this incurs a points deduction, but in terms of the future of the club itself, what are the implications of administration? It's not something I've ever fully understood, no matter who it's happened to. Does administration always lead to liquidation if a club can't get out of it? And if Rangers were to fold, would they be able to re-form again? </TEXT>

<TEXT>   increasing the likelihood that better and more entertaining teams are knocked out and worse teams slip into the knock-out stages

I really don't understand the objection to this from a sporting perspective. I've said before I'd love to see seedings done away with completely (not just in football) and just let the draw be completely random, but loads of people say to me things like "Yeah great, can you imagine Zenit vs Steaua Bucharest in the CL final?". 

But I don't see what's wrong with that. They're both professional football teams who've won their leagues, thereby earning themselves a place in the Champions League - if they both get lucky with the draws and end up playing in the final, then so be it. Just because they can't field the likes of Ronaldo or Messi, and might not play as attractively as the more famous teams, wouldn't make them any less worthy in my eyes.

I'd much rather an actual league champion from one of the less fashionable leagues won the CL than the team who finished 4th in the PL or La Liga etc. Personally, I'm getting fed up seeing the same teams constantly reaching the quarters etc.

(No offence to Zenit or Steaua fans btw, just the first two teams that popped into my head!).

EDIT: changed a few words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT: That title should read European competitions, not matches. Can't change it now :(

Just been having a wee nosy through some of the qualifying draw threads, and was just wondering - do you prefer your team to get drawn against the big guns? Or would you rather they got an easy group? I realise that sounds like a no-brainer, but I think it depends on the team you support.

As a Celtic fan, our chances of winning the Champions League (on the occassions we actually make it there!) have always been zero, so I love it when we get drawn against huge clubs like Barcelona, because the atmosphere on nights like that is always great.

I'm also an Everton fan, and I'm happy to see us get a pretty tough group in the Europa League, again because I think it'll make for some fantastic evenings at Goodison.

But I would imagine teams like Chelsea or Man City, who have aspirations of actually winning it, would much rather have an easier passage through the group stages, to conserve energy for the knockouts.

Just wondered what your views on it are? </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, of all the replies from Legia fans trying to explain their dislike for Celtic, this is the only one that I've actually understood.

When you say you'd expect your representative to say something, do you mean you'd expect them to offer the place to Celtic? Because I have to say, I personally don't think there's any team on the planet who would offer that, not with what's at stake.

But at least I understand your stance on it now.

<TEXT> Not strictly true. Legia forfeited the second leg by fielding a player they shouldn't have, which changed the result to a 3-0 win for Celtic. That changed the overall result to a 4-4 draw, putting Celtic through on away goals. 

If Legia had won the first leg 4-0, they would have gone through despite the second leg result being changed. They weren't disqualified outright.

Legia being kicked out the CL had absolutely nothing to do with Celtic, but that didn't stop the endless whining and bitching about it on here from some Legia fans, a lot of which was directed at Celtic, as if we were somehow to blame. Of course, it's the prerogative of Legia fans to come on here and act like arseholes if they want, but don't dish it out and start bleating if someone decides to return the favour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is the discussion just about managers handling troublesome players? Or does it extend to good man-management in general? i.e. getting the most out of players who could otherwise be quite ordinary?

I ask because I don't remember Celtic having too many troublesome players over the years, but I always felt Martin O'Neill was a brilliant man manager who always got the very best out of his players. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks mate, I think that's what I'm going to be doing. Because so many of the units use vespene gas, I often find I have a huge surplus of minerals, so at those points I'm going to start spamming the cannons. I tried zealots but they just get eaten up. I can position my cannons behind my gateway blocks. Cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm on the mission In Utter Darkness, and was just wondering how useful photon cannons are? I notice that they hit for 20 damage to land and air units, but they draw lots of aggro, and seem to die quite easily, whereas Immortals are much hardier, but only attack ground units. Am I wasting time building photon cannons or are they ok?

Please don't give me any other tips regarding the level, I'm slowly but surely working my towards getting it :)

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the reply mate :) I don't really have any map in particular in mind, I'm just trying to improve my overall game to complete the campaign more effectively. I'll give the bunkers a go definitely. I've also been using actual buildings like Barracks etc. to form the funnel, but then they don't attack at the same time! I was just thinking bunkers might be a bit weak, but if I have an SCV repairing, and a wall of units behind that would help.

Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Creating choke points in campaign </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-16 14:09:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm currently playing through the Terran campaign on Hard, and one of the things I'm trying to implement in my games is the formation of choke points leading to my base so that it funnels the enemy into a smaller point, the zerglings especially. I'm particularly looking for tips on how to create one when there's no ramp.

I was just wondering though, what's the best way to do it? My thinking was to have supply depots running into my base, forming a v-shape, and having perdition turrets, bunkers and siege tanks just behind them.

My main question is, will the enemy always run into the smallest point of the funnel, or will they just start attacking the furthest away supply depots, which would kind of defeat the whole purpose of the choke point.

Any tips on this would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

EDIT: Just noticed it says potentially involving those teams, so obviously nothing is set in stone. But if they do get 4 teams, they'll need more than one stadium. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have the upgrade for my SCVs to work together to build things faster, but I'm having a problem and was wondering if there's a way to solve it? If I select, say, 5 SCVs, then order them to build a barracks, they all scoot off to the footprint, but then only one starts building, and the other 4 just look on, so I then need to select them and get them to work on it. Is there a way to get them all working as soon as they arrive so that I can send them off and forget about them till the building is finished? I'm trying to perfect my technique of sealing off my base, and this would really help. (I don't know if this makes a difference, but I don't play multiplayer, just the campaign.)

Thanks.

And while a lot of people seem to be of the opinion that it will be between United and Liverpool for 4th, I can see Liverpool being a real force again next year. Yes, they've lost Suarez, but they seem to play with such belief, and Rodgers is slowly but surely improving the depth of the squad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a Liverpool fan, but for me, the fact that Liverpool will be playing a lot more games this year than they did last year is a bigger factor than losing Suarez. Didn't Man City end up playing something like 14 games more then Liverpool by the end?

Obviously this is why Rodgers is buying the way he is, for that much-needed depth. If the new signings (including those still to come) click and adapt to the PL, I don't see why Liverpool wouldn't be contenders again.

<TEXT>   He was a bad diver in his day but the media only focused on Drogba and Ronaldo.

There are many reasons why I can't stand Steven Gerrard, but the diving issue is number one for me. It's not so much that he dives per se, as unfortunately a lot of players do now. It's the fact that he had the absolute brass neck to spout all this hypocritical, sanctimonious bollocks in his autobiography and newspaper interviews about how diving was ruining the game, and that if he caught his team mates diving he'd 'have a word' etc. Fucking holier than thou arsehole.

I wouldn't actually mind if Liverpool won the league in the near future, they have a lot of likeable players, like Sturridge and Sterling. But I'm desperate for it not to happen while Gerrard is still around. I want him to retire before he gets his hands anywhere near that Premiership trophy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've just got my hands on FF XIII, but at the moment I just can't enjoy it, and it's down to one thing only - the ridiculously frequent cutscenes. Is the whole game like this???

I know the whole game is basically a corridor thing, which I don't mind, and I'm enjoying the new battle system. But having a cutscene after literally every 2 fights or something is really breaking up the rhythm of the game, and completely ruining my enjoyment of it (I'm about an hour into the game so far).

Should I just cut my losses on this? If it's going to stay this way all game, I'm chucking it on Ebay tomorrow! Or do the cutscenes get less frequent the longer you play? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm absolutely terrible at FM, and I'm always amazed when people take teams from the lower leagues to the top league in that country, then on to Champions League glory. But I was just wondering if anyone has won the Champions League with a team from one of the more unfashionable leagues (no offence intended).

The reason I ask is that, if you get a team from the lower leagues into the upper tier in a country like England, Germany or Spain, you then reap the riches from those leagues. But if you're constantly playing in the Finnish league for example, holding on to your best players is infinitely more difficult I would have thought.

Would love to hear about your successes (screenshots would be great too :) ) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-07-06 13:43:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After watching last night's penalty shootout, I started to wonder if it's possible for someone to get sent off during it, and what would happen if they did. especially if it was the goalkeeper?

I don't mean the stuff last night was worthy of a red card, but what if the player lost their head and punched the keeper? Would you lose that penalty, or would someone else take it?

And what if the keeper somehow managed to get sent off? Would they let the other keeper go in goals, or would they have to use one of the players, just as they would during the game (if they'd used all their subs).

I realise the chances of this happening are slim to none, but it's been going round my head so wondered if anyone knew for definite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. Just seeing his name in the team, like Messi or Ronaldo, is probably enough to unsettle some players, whereas the likes of Sturridge or Sterling, while still great players, just don't have that.

Conversely, seeing his name on the teamsheet must have been such a lift for the Liverpool players as well. I wonder if him leaving will have any kind of impact there.

Mind you, they did alright without him at the start of last season if I remember rightly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a Liverpool fan, but I think one of the things Liverpool will miss most when Suarez moves on is the fear factor he carries with him, like Torres did in his day. When Suarez is playing, you just know he's going to cause absolute havoc more or less the entire game, and more often than not pops up with at least one goal. 

With him gone, I'd be much less fearful of Liverpool. Don't get me wrong, they're still a fantastic team with brilliant players, and I would expect them to be up there challenging again, but I just think they're going to lose a bit of their aura this year without Suarez, and they wouldn't really have anyone to truly fear anymore. </TEXT>

But then I read a really good book about it all, that said thinking about nothing isn't what you're aiming for, because that's almost impossible to do, seeing as it's one of your brain's main functions. All you're doing is recognising thoughts for what they are as they pass into your mind, and just letting them go. It was definitely a big step in improving my meditations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it's definitely a tricky one to answer. I just find it odd that things like head-butting, biting, punching, kicking etc. are overlooked by the police, when they all constitute assault. Just because it happens on a pitch shouldn't make them exempt from the law. Another example I can think of is when Alan Shearer [kicked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPp0teYYi70feature=kp) Neil Lennon full in the face during a game, and nothing happened. </TEXT>

I've often wondered in the past why people who play sports seem to get away with doing things on the field (or whatever they play on), that would get them arrested if they were to do it in the street. I know that the players often receive fines and bans from their respective ruling organistaions, but is it always enough?

In some cases it's obviously difficult to tell whether there was malicious intent - for example, a really badly timed tackle. But there are other times where it's much more clear cut that someone has overstepped the mark to the point where it could be considered a criminal offence i.e. punching, kicking, biting etc.  An incident I remember well was when Duncan Ferguson was jailed for 3 months for [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOk8mZhX0Jk) head butt, after the police on duty at the match charged him for it.

Do you think it's something that should happen? Or should incidents like that be dealt with by the respective organisations, and left at that?

Obviously, I've started this thread in light of the Suarez incident today, but I don't mean this as a witch hunt against him, I do mean this in a general way.

I personally don't find this picture even slightly creepy, but it might be because there are lots of little villages where I live (England) that have churches very similar to this, so it's not that unusual to see. 

In fact, my friend got married in one that looks almost identical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope, none. I think it can be done, it's just a very expensive process. Having a cable isn't enough, you need an actual converter to turn the digital HDMI/DVI signal into an analog VGA signal (I think!). I'm just struggling to find the required component! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

I recently bought a PS3, and my plan is to use it through my PC monitor, as I have no television. I know nothing about all the different ports etc. that you get, but after doing some digging, I've found out that my monitor only has a VGA connection, and the HDMI cable I have for the PS3 is a HDMI-DVI one.

From the further reading I did, it seems that I need an actual converter that will turn my DVI signal into a VGA one. But I'm having trouble finding the required converter. I know they aren't cheap, but if someone could point me in the right direction of one, I'd be very grateful. Then I can make the decision on whether or not to get one.

I am going to upgrade my monitor at some point, but I want a 27 inch screen, so I need to save up a bit more. This would tide me over till then.

(The reason I mentioned that I'm in the UK is incase people were going to link to products).

Thanks so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good idea :)

[This](http://i.imgur.com/lHXjimx.jpg) is a map showing a 100 mile radius from (top to bottom) Newcastle, Manchester, Norwich, London and Southampton. If you include Swansea, it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/9jjbC4D.jpg).

So it does appear that the only region that isn't within 100 miles of an English team playing in the Premier League is the SW. Although this is of course as the crow flies. Travelling from the SW of England to Swansea would require you drive around, making it a much bigger distance. Unless there are any ferries that travel across to Wales from the SW, I have no idea! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost, but not quite! I used [this](http://www.freemaptools.com/radius-around-point.htm) tool online, and put a 100 mile radius around some of the major cities where premier league clubs play around the country (Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Norwich, London, Southampton) and it did more or less cover the whole country, with the exception of the South West. Putting a 100 mile radius around Swansea does cover a lot of that region, but obviously Swansea is in Wales, not England.

<TEXT> You're really confusing me now, so I'll try again from the top!

You asked why they would even try and fix a match, when the authorities were going to be scrutinising it. When you said 'they', I assumed you meant the Nigerian players.

In my reply I said they may still try and fix the match regardless, as these things often involve lots of money and they might feel it was worth the risk. In this particular case I did mean the Nigerian players, but I also mean generally. For example, the Pakistani cricket players who were caught match-fixing must have known the dangers of being caught, but went along with it anyway.

So, in summary, any players from any sport who get involved in match-fixing are likely to know that they're being watched or that the consequences of being caught would be dire, but the money to be made can be enough of a temptation to try it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No matter how many times I see it, I'll never be convinced this was anything but deliberate. A few people have said that he must have been putting pressure on both sides of the ball when he caught it, and when his right hand "slipped", the force of his left hand pushed the ball into the net. But the ball was coming straight at him more or less when he caught it, so most of the force from his hands would be behind the ball. I just don't believe for a second there would be enough force to push the ball in at that speed when his right hand did move without him actually chucking it in. 

I showed this to a friend of mine who abhors football and he burst out laughing when he saw it! </TEXT>

I have a Sanguine Bond + Crypt Incursion deck which I've used to pretty good effect, but the deck I love to beat more than others with it is the U/B mill deck. I just played someone who was playing Jace, as well as Phenax, and in two turns he managed to mill me to about 12 cards left, and the whole time I was just sitting grinning as he fed my win condition. (I play online, so I don't need to play with a poker face!)

Casting the crypt incursion right at the death was highly satisfying :D

<TEXT> I know there's been a recent thread about someone who took hours to complete a mission, only to have "hostiles killed:1" at the end, and I'm having a similar problem in The Surge level of the Knife of Dunwall DLC.

My question is - what kind of things can cause hostiles to be killed after you've knocked them out?

I know rats can eat them, so I always stash bodies off the floor.
I also know that falling from a height can kill them, so I always try to do a choke and carry.

What other ways can it happen? I got yet another single hostile killed in that level, even though I made sure no-one fell, and the bodies were out of the reach of rats (which I killed as well just to be sure!). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think one of the biggest obstacles Liverpool could face next year is that Man City would have to be dreadfully unlucky to have Toure, Kompany, Aguero and Silva all injured for the same amount of time they did this year. Wasn't there some stat that they'd only played 216 minutes together? If City can keep them fit next year, and they'll more than likely add a couple more players, things will be very tough for Liverpool, especially with them in Europe again, which requires the squad to be used to its fullest. They'll still be challenging though, regardless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/27048713) page from the BBC site is interesting. In the last decade, John Higgins is the only player to have won the championship (twice, in fact) having been involved in more frames than his opponent during the tournament. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want Ronnie to win because, like you, I want him to finish his career as the undisputed best of all time - most world titles, most centuries etc.

I think if he was to play Selby his chances would be much higher. I agree that Robertson seems to have that toughness, and wouldn't be intimidated by his opponent or the occasion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the reply :)

I do advance and build hard cover, but I was finding even that wasn't sufficient, but I've started to be more patient in my attacks, and sending back one unit at a time to reinforce while my other troops stay there and it seems to be working better. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I just started playing CoH a week or so ago, and I'm on the Hill 92 level and really struggling. The problem I'm having is that I send my troops etc. to attack, but each of my units loses a couple of guys or more, and I don't have the forward bases to replenish them, and I get overrun. Is there a tactic I should be employing that I don't know of? The only forward bases I can think of in this level are the ones on the left and right of the map. Is that what I should be using? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Not sure which version to buy - vanilla, survival or GOTY </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-12 20:19:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone, Tomb Raider is on sale in Steam at the moment and I'm definitely going to snap it up, but was wondering what the different versions include (well just surviuval and GOTY because vanilla is obvious!).

The reason I ask is because I bought Dead Space 2 GOTY and wish I hadn't because I hate the way that some of the DLC gives you better equipment earlier than you would normally get it, and I want to avoid that if I can with TR.

Does survival just add extra multiplayer maps, or does it include some equipment as well?

Would be very grateful for any info! </TEXT>

I think it looks like it's just going to be yet another in a long line of bad-average movies that lean far too heavily on the CGI aspect, at the expense of everything else (King Kong, Transformers, Avatar etc.). I really hope they prove me wrong! But the cgi at 0.45, and 1.09 just makes me cringe :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I checked this with the mods first and they're ok with me posting this. I've noticed a couple of hardcore pics of bimbos here recently, and just wanted to make everyone aware that myself and /u/timetopull set up a sub for that very reason called /r/bimboxxx 

To be honest, I feel like I'm ploughing a bit of a lone furrow there at the moment, so it would be great to see people over there and posting some stuff :)

Cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only imagine the number and content of the PMs you must receive. Although I'm a guy, I sometimes post pictures with the word 'selfie' in them, and on more than one occasion I've had guys think it was me in the picture and send me a plea to show them more of my heavenly body. I have to admit, I've been tempted to send them a quick snap of my dazzlingly pale, non-female form, just to see their reaction, but I've resisted so far! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the video, mate. When I watched the gif it made me wonder why she made that shot in the first place. I couldn't understand how she'd managed to judge the flight of the ball so badly that she had to hit the ball behind her own back! But that clip clears it all up :) (For anyone who can't see the clip for whatever reason, the ball hits the net on the way through, significantly changing the trajectory of the ball) </TEXT>

One of the things that makes me think this particular clip is staged is because when the girl bends down and gets the phone, she starts turning her head while the other guy is still there. Surely she'd see him in her peripheral vision from there? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't find it unbelievable that he's enlightened or completely accepting of his friend, and I'm glad that he is. What I find hard to believe is what you claim he actually said. As if his enlightenment is such that he wouldn't understand that the 'problem' his friend wanted to discuss was that he was coming out. It sounds like something from some cheesy teenage drama. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I'm really glad that your son doesn't see homosexuality as an issue, I genuinely am. But please, don't try and feed us the absolute absurdity that he's *so* enlightened and blase about it, that when his friend came out to him, he didn't even register that it was the 'problem' his friend wanted to talk about. Next time, maybe try something like:

My son's response was "Ok. Is this what you meant when you said you had a problem you wanted to talk about? Don't worry mate, we're best friends, I don't care about stuff like that."

Much more believable, and less likely to get people linking you to /r/thatHappened  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I made that sound as if anyone who likes it is 'wrong', which wasn't my intention. What I mean is that I'm convinced that there are lots of people who'll go along with anything that sounds remotely profound such as some of the quotes that go with these pictures, just because they think they should, or because it makes them look really deep, not because they actually believe it or understand it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm with you, I really don't get the love for this kind of thing. Personally, I think there's an air of The Emperor's New Clothes about it all. No one wants to be the person to stand up and say 'Actually, I think this is ridiculous', for fear of the reaction they'd get. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It could just be the old cynic in me, but please tell me I'm not the only one who enjoys these pictures from a photographic viewpoint, but finds the quotes that follow just absolute pretentious nonsense. Is this what these people are actually meant to have said at the time? Or were they allowed to go away and think about something and send it in? I only ask because I have never met anyone who speaks even remotely like almost all of these people, and reading them makes me grateful that that's the case!

EDIT: Changed wording </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's exactly where my frustration comes from. I try hard to post fresh content here, checking to make sure it's not in the top 50, or been posted in the last 15 days, and to come on and see that someone has actually taken the time to post such a nitpicking comment does my head in. I could understand if I'd posted a picture of a purple dress and said 'Green dress!', but red and orange are hardly a million miles away from each other. Surely people's enjoyment of these pictures aren't actually affected by any minor discrepancy between the title and what the picture actually shows? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am genuinely mystified as to why people post comments like this. So you came here to point out my mistake, saw that someone else had already done so, yet rather than just upvote them and move on, you upvoted (presumably) and then added this completely pointless comment. Are you really that desperate for everyone reading to know that you also spotted the mistake? That's the kind of thing I see in primary schools when a pupil blurts out 'I knew that!' when someone else gets the chance to answer, because they can't bear the thought of the teacher not acknowledging them for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, my eyes don't need checking. The reason I thought it was orange is because my room is dimly lit in the evenings, and I also run a program called F.lux. Blue light is thought to upset the circadian rhythm, which is why using a computer before bed can have negative effects on sleep. F.lux is a program that blocks that some of the blue light that emanates from my computer screen, which gives it an orange hue.

Obviously I can now see it's red, but do you really think snide remarks about people needing to have their eyesight checked is going to encourage people to post here? I'd love to think you were genuinely concerned for me, but I seriously doubt that.

You'll notice that over 200 people upvoted the picture, and no doubt a lot of them saw my mistake, but the vast majority didn't feel the need to publicly point it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wanted to return and say a huge thank you to /u/Rath1on for not letting me give up. I turned the difficulty down to Easy just to get through the dreadful prologue, and now I'm really having fun :) I do still find the combat a bit clunky and unresponsive, but on the other hand, it can be really exhilarating with the improved power of the signs etc.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do exactly the same thing and for the exact same reasons. I love watching the NFL but I always find myself wondering how people watching it on TV put up with these constant adverts,  they drive me absolutely mad. It was the same when I watched Aussie rules football in Australia. Certain channels literally had an ad break every time the game was stopped for whatever reason. It was awful!

<TEXT> Before the rest of my comment, I would like to make it clear that I absolutely agree that banning a child for 4 days for bringing in a small packet of mini cheddars is absolute lunacy.

However, having now worked in schools for a number of years, I would like to comment on some of the points raised here. A lot of comments focus on the fact that foods shouldn't be taught as good or bad, and that things like crisps etc. should be ok, as long as they form part of a good overall diet which is true. But while it's clear that everyone on this thread is well educated in what a child's diet should look like, the reality is that a lot of parents are either uneducated, or simply don't care, judging from some of the packed lunches I've seen pupils bring in, packed with crisps, fizzy drinks, sweets etc. If the parents are unwilling or unable to become educated about healthy eating, then it falls to us to instill that in pupils. The lack of education on subjects such as this among some parents is one of the main reasons we need to do PSHE (Personal, Social and Health Education) lessons in schools. Everything contained in these lessons, including those about a balanced diet, are things that pupils should be taught by their parents but, for whatever reason, they aren't.

People might also say that it's none of the school's business what a parent wants to feed their child, but I personally disagree with this. Of all the schools I've worked in, only one has not had a healthy eating policy, which meant pupils could bring in whatever they want, and the behaviour in that school was definitely the worst I've ever encountered. I realise that in itself can't be considered evidence, as there are other factors involved, but there are plenty of studies to indicate that healthy eating does improve children's behaviour on the whole. Trying to get 30 16-year-olds settled and focused when they're up to their eyeballs in sugar and caffeine wastes a ridiculous amount of time, that could, and should, be spent teaching.

Like I said, I agree that the situation contained in the link is overkill of the highest order, but to the people who are outraged that the school is trying to dictate what the pupils eat - it's done for the right reasons, but implementation of it is often troublesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you parry absolutely everything if not doing attacks?

The reason I say the quen slows things down is that I can be fighting, then realise I need to quen, so have to physically stop moving, then cast the quen, and then keep fighting. The stop start nature of it seems so clunky to me, unlike the games I loved the combat in like Arkham Asylum or God Of War </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I've tried the FCR and I'm afraid you're going to be losing more sleep! It's certainly an improvement, but not enough for me to try playing the whole game. I know what the main thing is now that I don't like about it, and it's the problems with the parry/riposte system. In the vanilla game, your animations are too slow, and you can't cancel them so you get killed so easily by other guys unless you constantly roll all over the place, and in the FCR, it doesn't seem to have any kind of parry system that you control, it seems totally random. And then, having to stop every now and then to cast Quen just slows everything down again. I'm afraid I just find it far too unwieldy to be enjoyable, but thank you for the help :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is why I asked whether or not the dodge spam is just in the prologue, or whether it carries on throughout the game. Part of the reason I'm struggling is definitely because I have so little in the way of traps, bombs etc. I just don't like the idea of, even with having lots of resources to hand, constantly having to roll all over the place. I'll reinstall FCR2 and give it another go :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the detailed response. Unfortunately, I don't think the game is going to be for me by the sounds of it, which is such a shame, I absolutely loved the first one! 

But the 3rd one should be out in the not too distant future, so hopefully I'll be able to enjoy that one :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Witcher 2 combat - dodge spam? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-28 22:32:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've just recently started playing the Witcher 2, and unfortunately I'm just not enjoying it at all due to the combat. I've read loads of things online about it, and the general consensus seems to be in order to be successful you use signs, attack, roll away, and repeat this over and over. Is that the case the whole way through the game?

Before people start having a go at me, I'm not saying the combat is bad, I'm just saying I personally don't find it enjoyable and won't do if dodge spam is a large part of what I need to do the entire game.

Would appreciate any replies.

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm about to play The Witcher 2 for the first time, and have the enhanced edition. I was under the impression that the Full Combat Rebalance mod was created by one of the developers, is that right?. Does that mean it was included in the enhanced edition, or do I still need to download and install it if I want to use it?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my experiences of cycling, there does seem to be a nice camaraderie between those of us who travel that way, particularly in cities. Often, when I stop at the lights and another cyclist pulls up, I'll start chatting to them, making the whole journey that bit more pleasant. That doesn't seem to exist with those who drive, but I realise that's because you're both in a box on wheels, and winding down the window to shout across to the other driver does seem a bit crazy. They'd probably be terrified more than anything!

But anyway, yes, this guy was being an arsehole.

ETA: I know these guys aren't on bicycles, but I would imagine there's a similar unspoken bond. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never been one to comment on what I think is a poor post, I just downvote and move on, but I have to break my silence for this. The joke here appears to be that OP has found something shaped like a Capri Sun carton, but it actually contains soup, is that right? The only way I can see how that would be even remotely funny, nevermind get almost 2000 upvotes, is if these cartons were a novelty or a new item where the OP was from, is that the case? I've seen a few comments here which make me think it could be.

In the UK, at least, these pouches have been on the shelves for years for all sorts of things. [Dolmio](http://uk-pic2.ciao.com/uk/140079923.jpg), [Uncle Ben's](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTdQVkmw3Z3gtnGB_G45TRFKvUeu6zh-aKu80CraxZdRZzWjFsivg), [Maltesers](http://www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/shops/statesidecandy/images/british-maltesers-chocolates-case-of-11x-135g-bags-6135-p.jpg), [Soup that isn't Campbell's](http://www.britishsupermarketworldwide.com/acatalog/loyd_grossman_tomato_basil_pouch_soup_420g.jpg). They're so commonplace that it wouldn't even enter my mind that it's like a Capri Sun bag. 

Ah well, to each his own I suppose! I'm off to buy aforementioned products and reap sweet karma!

<TEXT> I don't mean speculation at the time when Ferguson was leaving and there was still a vacancy to be filled. I mean this utterly pointless speculation about what might be if Mourinho had become Man United manager. Like I said, there are a ton of 'what if's' you could come up with that would affect the league. It's absolute drivel, and it's made worse so when you consider his position on the site. Is this really the best that the BBC's top sports writer can come up with? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it's the speculative nature of the post I'm alluding to. This guy is the chief sports writer for the BBC and he just comes out with the most inane stuff. 

Speculation is for the tabloids as far as I'm concerned. You could literally speculate all day on football matters! What if Rooney had gone to Chelsea? What if Wenger had spent more money? etc. etc. It's such poor quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I'm aware they went straight for Moyes on Ferguson's advice. But even if they had, the headline would have to read 'What if Mourinho had chosen Man United?'.

It's just so shoddy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This guy has to be one of the biggest hacks around. When it comes to the Premier League I'm entirely neutral, but even I can see that he writes an inordinate amount of articles related to Man United, and this is his latest cutting-edge offering:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25758108

The chief sports writer, penning an article based on a 'what if?'. It's ludicrous. And to name the article 'What if Man Utd had chosen Mourinho?' is idiotic in itself - Mourinho was never offered the United job!

I wish they'd sack him and use the money they save to bring back 606!! </TEXT>

Over the last few weeks I've added quite a few shortcuts to my toolbar at the top of the table, and I was just wondering if there's an option to make the shortcut toolbar thicker, so that all my shortcuts fit on it, rather than having to scroll left and right to find them?

<TEXT> As far as I'm concerned, Alia Janine is the best tit fucker out there, and so I wanted to share my favourite scene of hers with you all. I honestly had so much trouble deciding which section to make the gif from, but in the end I chose the part where her tits are all wet and slippery. I realise the gif is quite large, but I didn't want to cut it down anymore!

[Here](http://spankbang.com/1jrr/video/cumblastcity+mrs+janine+big+boobs+blasted) is the full, incredible video. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I do :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

I'm currently using the RES, although I don't know if that has anything to do with my question! Basically, I've now gotten to the point where I'm subbed to quite a number of different places, and was wondering if I can make the grey shortcut bar at the top thicker, so that all the shortcuts are there on the same line, rather than having to click left and right to find them.

Thanks peeps </TEXT>

<TITLE> A hardcore bimbo sub? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-05 16:53:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was just wondering what people thought about the idea of a bimbo sub dedicated to hardcore material? I absolutely love the pics that get posted here, but I'd love even more to see some gifs or videos of bimbos getting nailed or sucking cock, which is where half of the attraction comes from for me.

I realise the sub is NSFW by default, but that doesn't seem to extend to HC, and I think it's better that way - I always feel HC stuff should have its own sub.

Does anyone else think it's an idea that could work? Unfortunately I wouldn't be in a position to start it, I haven't been on this account for 30 days yet, and to be honest, I go back to work on Monday, so I'd be too busy to be a mod as well. If anyone did start one I'd definitely post on it and try to keep it going.

Anyway, just wanted to float the idea, and see what people thought :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Among the best cutscenes in gaming </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-05 00:34:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I realise FC3 is quite an old game now, but I only recently bought and played it, and have to say, the cutscenes in it are absolutely brilliant, and I can think of few better.

The animations as they talk to you are brilliantly done, with all the subtle hand gestures, and body movements, and the voice acting is of a really high standard as well I think.

It's been a while since cutscenes genuinely got me more immersed in the game! It's also been a while since cutscenes genuinely made me laugh, but with Dr Earnhart, Hurk etc. I was chortling with gusto! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best use of C4 and mines? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-03 14:34:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently just finished FC3 as a stealth player, but now I want to go back and become the embodiment of John Rambo. The thing is, I'm not sure how best to use C4 and mines in the game. In the experience I had in my stealth game, when enemies are fighting you, they often stay behind cover, and if they don't it's hard to predict where they'll go. Can anyone give me some tips on this? I'd be very grateful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've reached a point in the game where I'm finding dragon battles far too easy, and want to make them tougher. I know there is the mod Deadly Dragons, but I've tried and tried and can't get it to work. I also looked at Enhanced Mighty dragons but that seems to have been removed.

Are there any other active mods that could help me? Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> I swear I've never played a game where I've put off completing as much as I have with Skyrim. I'm now at level 43, but just keep telling myself "I'll do this, then go back to the main quest.....I'll do THIS then go back to the main quest".

I still have the Dawnguard DLC to get through, and I'm thinking of getting Dragonborn, downloading the Fight the Thalmor stuff, and THEN I'll finish the main quest (I'm more or less at the end of that).

Honestly, no game has ever had this effect on me - desperately trying to extend the game because I don't want it to be over! :( (Then I start again with my stealth character :P) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just wondering what you guys prefer your legs to be like? Do you prefer them thin, like those on a supermodel? Or do you prefer yours a bit thicker?

Personally, thin legs do nothing for me, I like mine with a bit more meat on them (up to a point!). I love to imagine them wrapped around my waist :D  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Had to respawn Belethor, now I can only enter his shop by breaking in, and he won't trade with me. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For some reason, Belethor died in my game, probably at the hands of vampires. I realised this happened when his shop was closed for days on end. I used the console command to respawn him, and he went into his shop, but my problem hasn't been solved. Even during the day, it still makes me pick the lock to get in the shop and he just tells me to get out. Is there any way to cure this? Whiterun is my go to place to sell things and without Belethor there, it's a massive pain :( </TEXT>

<TITLE> I wish there were more quests where you had to figure things out for yourself. Also looking for more examples in-game. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-21 13:25:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I absolutely love this game, and the quests are great, but I do wish they had more quests where not everything is handed to you on a plate, and you need to figure things out yourself from clues you're given.

One of my favourite quests was Lost to the Ages (from the Dawnguard DLC), where you receive a journal and have to use the map drawn in it with the notes to figure out where you have to go, and it's only when you arrive there that the marker appears. I feel that it just adds so much to the fun and immersion of the game. Also, I now have the Destruction Ritual Spell quest to do, and I'm busy trying to figure out where the clues lead with that book.

Are there other examples of quests like that in the game?

<TITLE> Are there any mods that show numerical values for health/magic/stamina in the HUD? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was wondering if there's a mod out there that adds numerical values to the stat bars on the hud? I'm playing as a mage, and would really like to know exactly how much magic I have so that I know exactly when I can cast a spell, rather than my usual "Fireba....oh no hang on. Right, fireb.....what??? still not enough?? OK NOW! FIREB.....oh I'm dead" 

It doesn't really help with the immersion :( Thanks for any help you can give </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

My favourite kind of picture or video when it comes to huge boobs is when a guy has his face mashed right into them, and I've seen enough material around to think that a subreddit on the subject could work, but was wondering if one like that exists already? I've tried searching but nothing has come up.

Thanks for any help! </TEXT>
