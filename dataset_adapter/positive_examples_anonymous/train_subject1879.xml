<TEXT> Hey, bud. I had a similar experience where I was someone (an ex that things should not have ended but they did) I had zero contact with for a year after things ended. I was in a relationship, but the interaction alone made me question everything in my life, left me unable to stop crying for days, and gave me my first real suicidal thoughts. It's been a few weeks though, and I came out on the other side. I don't really have any advice (other than to keep talking it out) but I just wanted to let you know to keep breathing and you'll make it out too, eventually. Your mind will focus on some other worry and it'll pass. Here if you need anything  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah gotcha. What I do sometimes when I'm really bad is make myself a self care checklist. So everyday I have to brush my teeth, get dressed, eat a healthy breakfast lunch dinner, do 30 minutes of any kind of body movement a day, and check to make sure my environment is cleanish. That way no matter how bad my day is, I still accomplished those (positive) things.

<TEXT> hey! welcome. i did the same thing sort of i went to a pediatrician for really bad tension in my neck and joints that i knew was caused by depression. when she suggested i do yoga, my mom took me to a psych. 

anyway, ive had a few stints in therapy since then, and some have been great. definitely look into SOME kind of help, theres no reason you need to be suffering (at least not without trying something)

<TEXT> hey! so it sounds like youre having cyclic thoughts, i get these too. something that has helped me (i had ones regarding death too) is everytime you realize you have these thoughts, acknowledge it. you can consciously then change the subject, and acknowledge that youre "just worrying" your brain is allowed to wander, its what it does, and recognizing that youre doing it without pulling your emotions into is helpful. hope something in this ramble helps.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the county jail i worked at in PA, you would write a request slip to the counselor/case manager in charge of workers. at that facility, you could do inside work even if you werent sentenced, but needed to be sentenced for outside work. Be nice to the counselor! dont write 2000 requests, be patient. if they didnt get back to you in a week, write another. good for you for wanting to work, itll definitely make your time go faster. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As I was getting over a heart break, a song appeared in my head and I can't for the life of me remember what it is or where it came from. I'm imagining a male's voice, like a singer/songwriter maybe, singing "you don't ever want to see me again, so you won't." Theres a chance it could be "I don't ever want to see you again, so I won't" My google searches came up empty. Anything? At some point I found a John Mayer song with similar lyrics but that wasn't it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, this is me, always. It's where the awful assumption "people aren't depressed they're just lazy" comes from. I think getting engrossed in tv or not harmful thoughts pushes away the bad thoughts. Or sometimes I can't clean my room because I physically can't get up and do it, not because I don't want to. It sucks when people don't understand. I think it's good you're recognizing it at least  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was 16. I was sitting on a plane and my mind was RACING and I was on the verge of tears, which was a common occurrence for me. I was looking around and realized this probably was not normal and everybody else on the plane wasn't going through this. I told my mom I needed help. 

I'm 20 and doing ok now :) there's just one last unhealthy behavior I'm sorting out

Thanks for asking </TEXT>

I'm still learning how to blend them and how to make them look best, but its been fun and overall im pretty pleased with them! These are synthetic.

<TEXT> A Home Based Program Worker for a branch of The Arc
-i got kicked out of a nursing home bc the people working at the agency were fucking morons and didnt have an appropriate professional relationship with the home
-nursing homes smell like poop and diaper all the time and hearing people moan was something that happened constantly
-had a client with ID who the supervisors didnt teach her that it was inappropriate to call me 30 times a day (literally)
-was manipulated into working with a client with a lot of medical problems who needed her colostomy bag (poop bag) changed, her period pad changed, i had to lift her and wasnt nearly strong enough/prepared
-was told to spend 6 hours with a client with basically no idea what to do 

its endless. if you live in central PA and are in the human services field, talk to me before getting a job.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to go back into counseling. I am miserable right now: not enjoying anything, over compulsive eating, not wanting to take my meds etc. but I'm on my parents insurance and I feel so guilty for burning through it if I go back to counseling. What if something bad happens (god forbid) but the insurance is all burnt out because of me?  </TEXT>
