<TITLE> Few questions regarding: BPD, CBT, and therapists. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-22 16:24:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. Does CBT work for BPD? or will I be reffered to a new therapist? 

2. I've been reading a lot about all this and I've seen a few times that therapists (apparently) don't like treating people with BPD, is this true? 

Extra information: Since I was 17 (now 19) I've been (on/off) seeing therapists, specifically doing CBT. The one I'm seeing at the moment, as far as I'm aware is only trained in cbt techniques. I only recently got diagnosed last week with BPD so it's all fairly new to me. </TEXT>
